if you wanted honesty\nThat's all you had to say\nI never want to let you down\nOr have you go, it's better off this way\n\nFor all the dirty looks\nThe photographs your boyfriend took\nRemember when you broke your foot\nFrom jumping out the second floor?\n\nI'm not okay\nI'm not okay\nI'm not okay\nYou wear me out\n\nWhat will it take to show you\nThat it's not the life it seems? (I'm not okay)\nI've told you time and time again\nYou sing the words, but don't know what it means (I'm not okay)\nYou might also like\nTo be a joke and look\nAnother line without a hook\nI held you close as we both shook\nFor the last time, take a good hard look\n\nI'm not okay\nI'm not okay\nI'm not okay\nYou wear me out\n\nForget about the dirty looks\nThe photographs your boyfriend took\nYou said you read me like a book\nBut the pages all are torn and frayed now\n\nBut I'm okay, I'm okay\nI'm okay now, (I'm okay now,) but you really need to listen to me\nBecause I'm telling you the
