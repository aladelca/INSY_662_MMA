Call my Aunt Marie

And bury me in all my favorite colors

I will not kiss you
'Cause the hardest part of this is leaving you

See the man who stands upon the hill
He dreams of all the battles won
But fate had left its scars upon his face
With all the damage they had done

And so time with age
It turns the page
Let the flesh
Submit itself to gravity

Let our bodies lay, mark our hearts with shame
Let our blood in vain, you find God in pain
Now, if your convictions were a passing faith
May your ashes feed the river in the morning rays
And as the vermin crawls
We lay in the foundations of decay

He was there, the day the towers fell
And so he wandered down the road
And we would all build towers of our own
Only to watch the roots corrode

But it's much too late
You're in the race
So we'll press
And press 'til you can't take it anymore

Let our bodies lay, mark our hearts with shame
Let our blood in vain, you find God in pain
And if, by his own hand, his spirit flies
Take his body as a relic to be canonized, now
And so he gets to die a saint
But she will always be the whore

(You look stressed out!)
Against faith (Cage all the animals)
Against all life ('Cause the message must be pure)
Against change (You can wander through the ruins)
We are plagued (But the poison is the cure)

You must fix your heart
And you must build an altar where it swells
When the storm it gains, and the sky it rains
Let it flood, let it flood, let it wash away
And as you stumble through your last crusade
Will you welcome your extinction in the morning rays?
And as the swarm it calls, we lay in the foundations
Yes, it comforts me much more
Yes, it comforts me much more
To lay in the foundations of decay

A long, long time ago
I can still remember how that music
Used to make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while
But February made me shiver
With every paper I'd deliver
Bad news on the doorstep
I couldn't take one more step
I can't remember if I cried
When I read about his widowed bride
Something touched me deep inside
The day the music died

So, bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
And them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singin', ""This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die,""

Did you write the book of love?
And do you have faith in God above
If the Bible tells you so?
Now, do you believe in rock 'n' roll?
Can music save your mortal soul?
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?
Well, I know that you're in love with him
'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues
I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck
With a pink carnation and a pickup truck
But I knew I was out of luck

Now, for ten years we've been on our own
And moss grows fat on a rollin' stone
But that's not how it used to be
When the jester sang for the king and queen
In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
And a voice that came from you and me
Oh, and while the king was looking down
The jester stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned
No verdict was returned
And while Lennon read a book on Marx
The quartet practiced in the park
And we sang dirges in the dark

Helter skelter in a summer swelter
The birds flew off with a fallout shelter
Eight miles high and fallin' fast
It landed foul on the grass
The players tried for a forward pass
With the jester on the sidelines in a cast
Now, the halftime air was sweet perfume
While sergeants played a marching tune
We all got up to dance
Oh, but we never got the chance
'Cause the players tried to take the field
The marching band refused to yield

Oh, and there we were all in one place
A generation lost in space
With no time left to start again
So, come on, Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jack Flash sat on a candlestick
'Cause fire is the Devil's only friend
Oh, and as I watched him on the stage
My hands were clenched in fists of rage
No angel born in Hell
Could break that Satan spell
And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
I saw Satan laughing with delight
The day the music died

I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away
I went down to the sacred store
Where I'd heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play
And in the streets, the children screamed
The lovers cried and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken
The church bells all were broken
And the three men I admire most
The Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died
And there I stood alone and afraid
I dropped to my knees and there I prayed
And I promised Him everything I could give
If only He would make the music live
And He promised it would live once more
But this time one would equal four
And in five years four had come to mourn
And the music was reborn

And they were singin', bye-bye, Miss American Pie

The spiked and winding cold seahorn. Have you the? Each, and for other, plash and silent roar.
Pearls: when she. Liszt's rhapsodies. Hissss.
You don't?
Did not: no, no: believe: Lidlyd. With a cock with a carra.
Black. Deepsounding. Do, Ben, do.
Wait while you wait. Hee hee. Wait while you hee.
But wait!
Low in dark middle earth. Embedded ore.
Naminedamine. Preacher is he:
All gone. All fallen.
Tiny, her tremulous fernfoils of maidenhair.
Amen! He gnashed in fury.
Fro. To, fro. A baton cool protruding.
Bronzelydia by Minagold.
By bronze, by gold, in oceangreen of shadow. Bloom. Old Bloom.
One rapped, one tapped, with a carra, with a cock.
Pray for him! Pray, good people!
His gouty fingers nakkering.
Big Benaben. Big Benben.
Last rose Castile of summer left bloom I feel so sad alone.
Pwee! Little wind piped wee.
True men. Lid Ker Cow De and Doll. Ay, ay. Like you men. Will lift your tschink with tschunk.
Fff! Oo!
Where bronze from anear? Where gold from afar? Where hoofs?
Rrrpr. Kraa. Kraandl.
Then not till then. My eppripfftaph. Be pfrwritt.
Done.
Begin!
Bronze by gold, miss Douce's head by miss Kennedy's head, over the crossblind of the Ormond bar heard the viceregal hoofs go by, ringing steel.
‚ÄîIs that her? asked miss Kennedy.
Miss Douce said yes, sitting with his ex, pearl grey and eau de Nil.
‚ÄîExquisite contrast, miss Kennedy said.
When all agog miss Douce said eagerly:
‚ÄîLook at the fellow in the tall silk.
‚ÄîWho? Where? gold asked more eagerly.
‚ÄîIn the second carriage, miss Douce's wet lips said, laughing in the sun.
He's looking. Mind till I see.
She darted, bronze, to the backmost corner, flattening her face against the pane in a halo of hurried breath.
Her wet lips tittered:
‚ÄîHe's killed looking back.
She laughed:
‚ÄîO wept! Aren't men frightful idiots?
With sadness.
Miss Kennedy sauntered sadly from bright light, twining a loose hair behind an ear. Sauntering sadly, gold no more, she twisted twined a hair.
Sadly she twined in sauntering gold hair behind a curving ear.
‚ÄîIt's them has the fine times, sadly then she said.
A man.
Bloowho went by by Moulang's pipes bearing in his breast the sweets of sin, by Wine's antiques, in memory bearing sweet sinful words, by Carroll's dusky battered plate, for Raoul.
The boots to them, them in the bar, them barmaids came. For them unheeding him he banged on the counter his tray of chattering china. And
‚ÄîThere's your teas, he said.
Miss Kennedy with manners transposed the teatray down to an upturned lithia crate, safe from eyes, low.
‚ÄîWhat is it? loud boots unmannerly asked.
‚ÄîFind out, miss Douce retorted, leaving her spyingpoint.
‚ÄîYour beau, is it?
A haughty bronze replied:
‚ÄîI'll complain to Mrs de Massey on you if I hear any more of your impertinent insolence.
‚ÄîImperthnthn thnthnthn, bootssnout sniffed rudely, as he retreated as she threatened as he had come.
Bloom.
On her flower frowning miss Douce said:
‚ÄîMost aggravating that young brat is. If he doesn't conduct himself I'll wring his ear for him a yard long.
Ladylike in exquisite contrast.
‚ÄîTake no notice, miss Kennedy rejoined.
She poured in a teacup tea, then back in the teapot tea. They cowered under their reef of counter, waiting on footstools, crates upturned, waiting for their teas to draw. They pawed their blouses, both of black satin, two and nine a yard, waiting for their teas to draw, and two and seven.
Yes, bronze from anear, by gold from afar, heard steel from anear, hoofs ring from afar, and heard steelhoofs ringhoof ringsteel.
‚ÄîAm I awfully sunburnt?
Miss bronze unbloused her neck.
‚ÄîNo, said miss Kennedy. It gets brown after. Did you try the borax with the cherry laurel water?
Miss Douce halfstood to see her skin askance in the barmirror gildedlettered where hock and claret glasses shimmered and in their midst a shell.
‚ÄîAnd leave it to my hands, she said.
‚ÄîTry it with the glycerine, miss Kennedy advised.
Bidding her neck and hands adieu miss Douce
‚ÄîThose things only bring out a rash, replied, reseated. I asked that old fogey in Boyd's for something for my skin.
Miss Kennedy, pouring now a fulldrawn tea, grimaced and prayed:
‚ÄîO, don't remind me of him for mercy' sake!
‚ÄîBut wait till I tell you, miss Douce entreated.
Sweet tea miss Kennedy having poured with milk plugged both two ears with little fingers.
‚ÄîNo, don't, she cried.
‚ÄîI won't listen, she cried.
But Bloom?
Miss Douce grunted in snuffy fogey's tone:
‚ÄîFor your what? says he.
Miss Kennedy unplugged her ears to hear, to speak: but said, but prayed again:
‚ÄîDon't let me think of him or I'll expire. The hideous old wretch! That night in the Antient Concert Rooms.
She sipped distastefully her brew, hot tea, a sip, sipped, sweet tea.
‚ÄîHere he was, miss Douce said, cocking her bronze head three quarters, ruffling her nosewings. Hufa! Hufa!
Shrill shriek of laughter sprang from miss Kennedy's throat. Miss Douce huffed and snorted down her nostrils that quivered imperthnthn like a snout in quest.
‚ÄîO! shrieking, miss Kennedy cried. Will you ever forget his goggle eye?
Miss Douce chimed in in deep bronze laughter, shouting:
‚ÄîAnd your other eye!
Bloowhose dark eye read Aaron Figatner's name. Why do I always think Figather? Gathering figs, I think. And Prosper Lore's huguenot name. By Bassi's blessed virgins Bloom's dark eyes went by. Bluerobed, white under, come to me. God they believe she is: or goddess. Those today. I could not see. That fellow spoke. A student. After with Dedalus' son. He might be Mulligan. All comely virgins. That brings those rakes of fellows in: her white.
By went his eyes. The sweets of sin. Sweet are the sweets.
Of sin.
In a giggling peal young goldbronze voices blended, Douce with Kennedy your other eye. They threw young heads back, bronze gigglegold, to let freefly their laughter, screaming, your other, signals to each other, high piercing notes.
Ah, panting, sighing, sighing, ah, fordone, their mirth died down.
Miss Kennedy lipped her cup again, raised, drank a sip and gigglegiggled. Miss Douce, bending over the teatray, ruffled again her nose and rolled droll fattened eyes. Again Kennygiggles, stooping, her fair pinnacles of hair, stooping, her tortoise napecomb showed, spluttered out of her mouth her tea, choking in tea and laughter, coughing with choking, crying:
‚ÄîO greasy eyes! Imagine being married to a man like that! she cried. With his bit of beard!
Douce gave full vent to a splendid yell, a full yell of full woman, delight, joy, indignation.
‚ÄîMarried to the greasy nose! she yelled.
Shrill, with deep laughter, after, gold after bronze, they urged each each to peal after peal, ringing in changes, bronzegold, goldbronze, shrilldeep, to laughter after laughter. And then laughed more. Greasy I knows. Exhausted, breathless, their shaken heads they laid, braided and pinnacled by glossycombed, against the counterledge. All flushed (O!), panting, sweating (O!), all breathless.
Married to Bloom, to greaseabloom.
‚ÄîO saints above! miss Douce said, sighed above her jumping rose. I wished
I hadn't laughed so much. I feel all wet.
‚ÄîO, miss Douce! miss Kennedy protested. You horrid thing!
And flushed yet more (you horrid!), more goldenly.
By Cantwell's offices roved Greaseabloom, by Ceppi's virgins, bright of their oils. Nannetti's father hawked those things about, wheedling at doors as I. Religion pays. Must see him for that par. Eat first. I want. Not yet. At four, she said. Time ever passing. Clockhands turning. On. Where eat? The Clarence, Dolphin. On. For Raoul. Eat. If I net five guineas with those ads. The violet silk petticoats. Not yet. The sweets of sin.
Flushed less, still less, goldenly paled.
Into their bar strolled Mr Dedalus. Chips, picking chips off one of his rocky thumbnails. Chips. He strolled.
‚ÄîO, welcome back, miss Douce.
He held her hand. Enjoyed her holidays?
‚ÄîTiptop.
He hoped she had nice weather in Rostrevor.
‚ÄîGorgeous, she said. Look at the holy show I am. Lying out on the strand all day.
Bronze whiteness.
‚ÄîThat was exceedingly naughty of you, Mr Dedalus told her and pressed her hand indulgently. Tempting poor simple males.
Miss Douce of satin douced her arm away.
‚ÄîO go away! she said. You're very simple, I don't think.
He was.
‚ÄîWell now I am, he mused. I looked so simple in the cradle they christened me simple Simon.
‚ÄîYou must have been a doaty, miss Douce made answer. And what did the doctor order today?
‚ÄîWell now, he mused, whatever you say yourself. I think I'll trouble you for some fresh water and a half glass of whisky.
Jingle.
‚ÄîWith the greatest alacrity, miss Douce agreed.
With grace of alacrity towards the mirror gilt Cantrell and Cochrane's she turned herself. With grace she tapped a measure of gold whisky from her crystal keg. Forth from the skirt of his coat Mr Dedalus brought pouch and pipe. Alacrity she served. He blew through the flue two husky fifenotes.
‚ÄîBy Jove, he mused, I often wanted to see the Mourne mountains. Must be a great tonic in the air down there. But a long threatening comes at last, they say. Yes. Yes.
Yes. He fingered shreds of hair, her maidenhair, her mermaid's, into the bowl. Chips. Shreds. Musing. Mute.
None nought said nothing. Yes.
Gaily miss Douce polished a tumbler, trilling:
‚ÄîO, Idolores, queen of the eastern seas!
‚ÄîWas Mr Lidwell in today?
In came Lenehan. Round him peered Lenehan. Mr Bloom reached Essex bridge. Yes, Mr Bloom crossed bridge of Yessex. To Martha I must write. Buy paper. Daly's. Girl there civil. Bloom. Old Bloom. Blue bloom is on the rye.
‚ÄîHe was in at lunchtime, miss Douce said.
Lenehan came forward.
‚ÄîWas Mr Boylan looking for me?
He asked. She answered:
‚ÄîMiss Kennedy, was Mr Boylan in while I was upstairs?
She asked. Miss voice of Kennedy answered, a second teacup poised, her gaze upon a page:
‚ÄîNo. He was not.
Miss gaze of Kennedy, heard, not seen, read on. Lenehan round the sandwichbell wound his round body round.
‚ÄîPeep! Who's in the corner?
No glance of Kennedy rewarding him he yet made overtures. To mind her stops. To read only the black ones: round o and crooked ess.
Jingle jaunty jingle.
Girlgold she read and did not glance. Take no notice. She took no notice while he read by rote a solfa fable for her, plappering flatly:
‚ÄîAh fox met ah stork. Said thee fox too thee stork: Will you put your bill down inn my troath and pull upp ah bone?
He droned in vain. Miss Douce turned to her tea aside.
He sighed aside:
‚ÄîAh me! O my!
He greeted Mr Dedalus and got a nod.
‚ÄîGreetings from the famous son of a famous father.
‚ÄîWho may he be? Mr Dedalus asked.
Lenehan opened most genial arms. Who?
‚ÄîWho may he be? he asked. Can you ask? Stephen, the youthful bard.
Dry.
Mr Dedalus, famous father, laid by his dry filled pipe.
‚ÄîI see, he said. I didn't recognise him for the moment. I hear he is keeping very select company. Have you seen him lately?
He had.
‚ÄîI quaffed the nectarbowl with him this very day, said Lenehan. In Mooney's en ville and in Mooney's sur mer. He had received the rhino for the labour of his muse.
He smiled at bronze's teabathed lips, at listening lips and eyes:
‚ÄîThe √©lite of Erin hung upon his lips. The ponderous pundit, Hugh
MacHugh, Dublin's most brilliant scribe and editor and that minstrel boy of the wild wet west who is known by the euphonious appellation of the O'Madden Burke.
After an interval Mr Dedalus raised his grog and
‚ÄîThat must have been highly diverting, said he. I see.
He see. He drank. With faraway mourning mountain eye. Set down his glass.
He looked towards the saloon door.
‚ÄîI see you have moved the piano.
‚ÄîThe tuner was in today, miss Douce replied, tuning it for the smoking concert and I never heard such an exquisite player.
‚ÄîIs that a fact?
‚ÄîDidn't he, miss Kennedy? The real classical, you know. And blind too, poor fellow. Not twenty I'm sure he was.
‚ÄîIs that a fact? Mr Dedalus said.
He drank and strayed away.
‚ÄîSo sad to look at his face, miss Douce condoled.
God's curse on bitch's bastard.
Tink to her pity cried a diner's bell. To the door of the bar and diningroom came bald Pat, came bothered Pat, came Pat, waiter of Ormond. Lager for diner. Lager without alacrity she served.
With patience Lenehan waited for Boylan with impatience, for jinglejaunty blazes boy.
Upholding the lid he (who?) gazed in the coffin (coffin?) at the oblique triple (piano!) wires. He pressed (the same who pressed indulgently her hand), soft pedalling, a triple of keys to see the thicknesses of felt advancing, to hear the muffled hammerfall in action.
Two sheets cream vellum paper one reserve two envelopes when I was in Wisdom Hely's wise Bloom in Daly's Henry Flower bought. Are you not happy in your home? Flower to console me and a pin cuts lo. Means something, language of flow. Was it a daisy? Innocence that is. Respectable girl meet after mass. Thanks awfully muchly. Wise Bloom eyed on the door a poster, a swaying mermaid smoking mid nice waves. Smoke mermaids, coolest whiff of all. Hair streaming: lovelorn. For some man. For Raoul. He eyed and saw afar on Essex bridge a gay hat riding on a jaunting car. It is. Again. Third time. Coincidence.
Jingling on supple rubbers it jaunted from the bridge to Ormond quay. Follow. Risk it. Go quick. At four. Near now. Out.
‚ÄîTwopence, sir, the shopgirl dared to say.
‚ÄîAha... I was forgetting... Excuse...
‚ÄîAnd four.
At four she. Winsomely she on Bloohimwhom smiled. Bloo smi qui go. Ternoon. Think you're the only pebble on the beach? Does that to all.
For men.
In drowsy silence gold bent on her page.
From the saloon a call came, long in dying. That was a tuningfork the tuner had that he forgot that he now struck. A call again. That he now poised that it now throbbed. You hear? It throbbed, pure, purer, softly and softlier, its buzzing prongs. Longer in dying call.
Pat paid for diner's popcorked bottle: and over tumbler, tray and popcorked bottle ere he went he whispered, bald and bothered, with miss
Douce.
‚ÄîThe bright stars fade...
A voiceless song sang from within, singing:
‚Äî... the morn is breaking.
A duodene of birdnotes chirruped bright treble answer under sensitive hands. Brightly the keys, all twinkling, linked, all harpsichording, called to a voice to sing the strain of dewy morn, of youth, of love's leavetaking, life's, love's morn.
‚ÄîThe dewdrops pearl...
Lenehan's lips over the counter lisped a low whistle of decoy.
‚ÄîBut look this way, he said, rose of Castile.
Jingle jaunted by the curb and stopped.
She rose and closed her reading, rose of Castile: fretted, forlorn, dreamily rose.
‚ÄîDid she fall or was she pushed? he asked her.
She answered, slighting:
‚ÄîAsk no questions and you'll hear no lies.
Like lady, ladylike.
Blazes Boylan's smart tan shoes creaked on the barfloor where he strode. Yes, gold from anear by bronze from afar. Lenehan heard and knew and hailed him:
‚ÄîSee the conquering hero comes.
Between the car and window, warily walking, went Bloom, unconquered hero. See me he might. The seat he sat on: warm. Black wary hecat walked towards Richie Goulding's legal bag, lifted aloft, saluting.
‚ÄîAnd I from thee...
‚ÄîI heard you were round, said Blazes Boylan.
He touched to fair miss Kennedy a rim of his slanted straw. She smiled on him. But sister bronze outsmiled her, preening for him her richer hair, a bosom and a rose.
Smart Boylan bespoke potions.
‚ÄîWhat's your cry? Glass of bitter? Glass of bitter, please, and a sloegin for me. Wire in yet?
Not yet. At four she. Who said four?
Cowley's red lugs and bulging apple in the door of the sheriff's office.
Avoid. Goulding a chance. What is he doing in the Ormond? Car waiting.
Wait.
Hello. Where off to? Something to eat? I too was just. In here. What, Ormond? Best value in Dublin. Is that so? Diningroom. Sit tight there. See, not be seen. I think I'll join you. Come on. Richie led on. Bloom followed bag. Dinner fit for a prince.
Miss Douce reached high to take a flagon, stretching her satin arm, her bust, that all but burst, so high.
‚ÄîO! O! jerked Lenehan, gasping at each stretch. O!
But easily she seized her prey and led it low in triumph.
‚ÄîWhy don't you grow? asked Blazes Boylan.
Shebronze, dealing from her oblique jar thick syrupy liquor for his lips, looked as it flowed (flower in his coat: who gave him?), and syrupped with her voice:
‚ÄîFine goods in small parcels.
That is to say she. Neatly she poured slowsyrupy sloe.
‚ÄîHere's fortune, Blazes said.
He pitched a broad coin down. Coin rang.
‚ÄîHold on, said Lenehan, till I...
‚ÄîFortune, he wished, lifting his bubbled ale.
‚ÄîSceptre will win in a canter, he said.
‚ÄîI plunged a bit, said Boylan winking and drinking. Not on my own, you know. Fancy of a friend of mine.
Lenehan still drank and grinned at his tilted ale and at miss Douce's lips that all but hummed, not shut, the oceansong her lips had trilled.
Idolores. The eastern seas.
Clock whirred. Miss Kennedy passed their way (flower, wonder who gave), bearing away teatray. Clock clacked.
Miss Douce took Boylan's coin, struck boldly the cashregister. It clanged. Clock clacked. Fair one of Egypt teased and sorted in the till and hummed and handed coins in change. Look to the west. A clack. For me.
‚ÄîWhat time is that? asked Blazes Boylan. Four?
O'clock.
Lenehan, small eyes ahunger on her humming, bust ahumming, tugged Blazes Boylan's elbowsleeve.
‚ÄîLet's hear the time, he said.
The bag of Goulding, Collis, Ward led Bloom by ryebloom flowered tables. Aimless he chose with agitated aim, bald Pat attending, a table near the door. Be near. At four. Has he forgotten? Perhaps a trick. Not come: whet appetite. I couldn't do. Wait, wait. Pat, waiter, waited.
Sparkling bronze azure eyed Blazure's skyblue bow and eyes.
‚ÄîGo on, pressed Lenehan. There's no-one. He never heard.
‚Äî... to Flora's lips did hie.
High, a high note pealed in the treble clear.
Bronzedouce communing with her rose that sank and rose sought
Blazes Boylan's flower and eyes.
‚ÄîPlease, please.
He pleaded over returning phrases of avowal.
‚ÄîI could not leave thee...
‚ÄîAfterwits, miss Douce promised coyly.
‚ÄîNo, now, urged Lenehan. Sonnezlacloche! O do! There's no-one.
She looked. Quick. Miss Kenn out of earshot. Sudden bent. Two kindling faces watched her bend.
Quavering the chords strayed from the air, found it again, lost chord, and lost and found it, faltering.
‚ÄîGo on! Do! Sonnez!
Bending, she nipped a peak of skirt above her knee. Delayed. Taunted them still, bending, suspending, with wilful eyes.
‚ÄîSonnez!
Smack. She set free sudden in rebound her nipped elastic garter smackwarm against her smackable a woman's warmhosed thigh.
‚ÄîLa Cloche! cried gleeful Lenehan. Trained by owner. No sawdust there.
She smilesmirked supercilious (wept! aren't men?), but, lightward gliding, mild she smiled on Boylan.
‚ÄîYou're the essence of vulgarity, she in gliding said.
Boylan, eyed, eyed. Tossed to fat lips his chalice, drank off his chalice tiny, sucking the last fat violet syrupy drops. His spellbound eyes went after, after her gliding head as it went down the bar by mirrors, gilded arch for ginger ale, hock and claret glasses shimmering, a spiky shell, where it concerted, mirrored, bronze with sunnier bronze.
Yes, bronze from anearby.
‚Äî... Sweetheart, goodbye!
‚ÄîI'm off, said Boylan with impatience.
He slid his chalice brisk away, grasped his change.
‚ÄîWait a shake, begged Lenehan, drinking quickly. I wanted to tell you.
Tom Rochford...
‚ÄîCome on to blazes, said Blazes Boylan, going.
Lenehan gulped to go.
‚ÄîGot the horn or what? he said. Wait. I'm coming.
He followed the hasty creaking shoes but stood by nimbly by the threshold, saluting forms, a bulky with a slender.
‚ÄîHow do you do, Mr Dollard?
‚ÄîEh? How do? How do? Ben Dollard's vague bass answered, turning an instant from Father Cowley's woe. He won't give you any trouble, Bob. Alf Bergan will speak to the long fellow. We'll put a barleystraw in that Judas Iscariot's ear this time.
Sighing Mr Dedalus came through the saloon, a finger soothing an eyelid.
‚ÄîHoho, we will, Ben Dollard yodled jollily. Come on, Simon. Give us a ditty. We heard the piano.
Bald Pat, bothered waiter, waited for drink orders. Power for Richie. And Bloom? Let me see. Not make him walk twice. His corns. Four now. How warm this black is. Course nerves a bit. Refracts (is it?) heat. Let me see. Cider. Yes, bottle of cider.
‚ÄîWhat's that? Mr Dedalus said. I was only vamping, man.
‚ÄîCome on, come on, Ben Dollard called. Begone dull care. Come, Bob.
He ambled Dollard, bulky slops, before them (hold that fellow with the: hold him now) into the saloon. He plumped him Dollard on the stool. His gouty paws plumped chords. Plumped, stopped abrupt.
Bald Pat in the doorway met tealess gold returning. Bothered, he wanted Power and cider. Bronze by the window, watched, bronze from afar.
Jingle a tinkle jaunted.
Bloom heard a jing, a little sound. He's off. Light sob of breath Bloom sighed on the silent bluehued flowers. Jingling. He's gone. Jingle. Hear.
‚ÄîLove and War, Ben, Mr Dedalus said. God be with old times.
Miss Douce's brave eyes, unregarded, turned from the crossblind, smitten by sunlight. Gone. Pensive (who knows?), smitten (the smiting light), she lowered the dropblind with a sliding cord. She drew down pensive (why did he go so quick when I?) about her bronze, over the bar where bald stood by sister gold, inexquisite contrast, contrast inexquisite nonexquisite, slow cool dim seagreen sliding depth of shadow, eau de Nil.
‚ÄîPoor old Goodwin was the pianist that night, Father Cowley reminded them. There was a slight difference of opinion between himself and the Collard grand.
There was.
‚ÄîA symposium all his own, Mr Dedalus said. The devil wouldn't stop him. He was a crotchety old fellow in the primary stage of drink.
‚ÄîGod, do you remember? Ben bulky Dollard said, turning from the punished keyboard. And by Japers I had no wedding garment.
They laughed all three. He had no wed. All trio laughed. No wedding garment.
‚ÄîOur friend Bloom turned in handy that night, Mr Dedalus said. Where's my pipe, by the way?
He wandered back to the bar to the lost chord pipe. Bald Pat carried two diners' drinks, Richie and Poldy. And Father Cowley laughed again.
‚ÄîI saved the situation, Ben, I think.
‚ÄîYou did, averred Ben Dollard. I remember those tight trousers too. That was a brilliant idea, Bob.
Father Cowley blushed to his brilliant purply lobes. He saved the situa. Tight trou. Brilliant ide.
‚ÄîI knew he was on the rocks, he said. The wife was playing the piano in the coffee palace on Saturdays for a very trifling consideration and who was it gave me the wheeze she was doing the other business? Do you remember? We had to search all Holles street to find them till the chap in Keogh's gave us the number. Remember? Ben remembered, his broad visage wondering.
‚ÄîBy God, she had some luxurious operacloaks and things there.
Mr Dedalus wandered back, pipe in hand.
‚ÄîMerrion square style. Balldresses, by God, and court dresses. He wouldn't take any money either. What? Any God's quantity of cocked hats and boleros and trunkhose. What?
‚ÄîAy, ay, Mr Dedalus nodded. Mrs Marion Bloom has left off clothes of all descriptions.
Jingle jaunted down the quays. Blazes sprawled on bounding tyres.
Liver and bacon. Steak and kidney pie. Right, sir. Right, Pat.
Mrs Marion. Met him pike hoses. Smell of burn. Of Paul de Kock. Nice name he.
‚ÄîWhat's this her name was? A buxom lassy. Marion...
‚ÄîTweedy.
‚ÄîYes. Is she alive?
‚ÄîAnd kicking.
‚ÄîShe was a daughter of...
‚ÄîDaughter of the regiment.
‚ÄîYes, begad. I remember the old drummajor.
Mr Dedalus struck, whizzed, lit, puffed savoury puff after
‚ÄîIrish? I don't know, faith. Is she, Simon?
Puff after stiff, a puff, strong, savoury, crackling.
‚ÄîBuccinator muscle is... What?... Bit rusty... O, she is... My Irish Molly, O.
He puffed a pungent plumy blast.
‚ÄîFrom the rock of Gibraltar... all the way.
They pined in depth of ocean shadow, gold by the beerpull, bronze by maraschino, thoughtful all two. Mina Kennedy, 4 Lismore terrace, Drumcondra with Idolores, a queen, Dolores, silent.
Pat served, uncovered dishes. Leopold cut liverslices. As said before he ate with relish the inner organs, nutty gizzards, fried cods' roes while Richie Goulding, Collis, Ward ate steak and kidney, steak then kidney, bite by bite of pie he ate Bloom ate they ate.
Bloom with Goulding, married in silence, ate. Dinners fit for princes.
By Bachelor's walk jogjaunty jingled Blazes Boylan, bachelor, in sun in heat, mare's glossy rump atrot, with flick of whip, on bounding tyres: sprawled, warmseated, Boylan impatience, ardentbold. Horn. Have you the? Horn. Have you the? Haw haw horn.
Over their voices Dollard bassooned attack, booming over bombarding chords:
‚ÄîWhen love absorbs my ardent soul...
Roll of Bensoulbenjamin rolled to the quivery loveshivery roofpanes.
‚ÄîWar! War! cried Father Cowley. You're the warrior.
‚ÄîSo I am, Ben Warrior laughed. I was thinking of your landlord. Love or money.
He stopped. He wagged huge beard, huge face over his blunder huge.
‚ÄîSure, you'd burst the tympanum of her ear, man, Mr Dedalus said through smoke aroma, with an organ like yours.
In bearded abundant laughter Dollard shook upon the keyboard. He would.
‚ÄîNot to mention another membrane, Father Cowley added. Half time, Ben. Amoroso ma non troppo. Let me there.
Miss Kennedy served two gentlemen with tankards of cool stout. She passed a remark. It was indeed, first gentleman said, beautiful weather. They drank cool stout. Did she know where the lord lieutenant was going? And heard steelhoofs ringhoof ring. No, she couldn't say. But it would be in the paper. O, she need not trouble. No trouble. She waved about her outspread Independent, searching, the lord lieutenant, her pinnacles of hair slowmoving, lord lieuten. Too much trouble, first gentleman said. O, not in the least. Way he looked that. Lord lieutenant. Gold by bronze heard iron steel.
‚Äî............ my ardent soul
I care not foror the morrow.
In liver gravy Bloom mashed mashed potatoes. Love and War someone is. Ben Dollard's famous. Night he ran round to us to borrow a dress suit for that concert. Trousers tight as a drum on him. Musical porkers. Molly did laugh when he went out. Threw herself back across the bed, screaming, kicking. With all his belongings on show. O saints above, I'm drenched! O, the women in the front row! O, I never laughed so many! Well, of course that's what gives him the base barreltone. For instance eunuchs. Wonder who's playing. Nice touch. Must be Cowley. Musical. Knows whatever note you play. Bad breath he has, poor chap. Stopped.
Miss Douce, engaging, Lydia Douce, bowed to suave solicitor, George Lidwell, gentleman, entering. Good afternoon. She gave her moist (a lady's) hand to his firm clasp. Afternoon. Yes, she was back. To the old dingdong again.
‚ÄîYour friends are inside, Mr Lidwell.
George Lidwell, suave, solicited, held a lydiahand.
Bloom ate liv as said before. Clean here at least. That chap in the Burton, gummy with gristle. No-one here: Goulding and I. Clean tables, flowers, mitres of napkins. Pat to and fro. Bald Pat. Nothing to do. Best value in Dub.
Piano again. Cowley it is. Way he sits in to it, like one together, mutual understanding. Tiresome shapers scraping fiddles, eye on the bowend, sawing the cello, remind you of toothache. Her high long snore. Night we were in the box. Trombone under blowing like a grampus, between the acts, other brass chap unscrewing, emptying spittle. Conductor's legs too, bagstrousers, jiggedy jiggedy. Do right to hide them.
Jiggedy jingle jaunty jaunty.
Only the harp. Lovely. Gold glowering light. Girl touched it. Poop of a lovely. Gravy's rather good fit for a. Golden ship. Erin. The harp that once or twice. Cool hands. Ben Howth, the rhododendrons. We are their harps. I. He. Old. Young.
‚ÄîAh, I couldn't, man, Mr Dedalus said, shy, listless.
Strongly.
‚ÄîGo on, blast you! Ben Dollard growled. Get it out in bits.
‚ÄîM'appari, Simon, Father Cowley said.
Down stage he strode some paces, grave, tall in affliction, his long arms outheld. Hoarsely the apple of his throat hoarsed softly. Softly he sang to a dusty seascape there: A Last Farewell. A headland, a ship, a sail upon the billows. Farewell. A lovely girl, her veil awave upon the wind upon the headland, wind around her.
Cowley sang:
‚ÄîM'appari tutt'amor:
Il mio sguardo l'incontr...
She waved, unhearing Cowley, her veil, to one departing, dear one, to wind, love, speeding sail, return.
‚ÄîGo on, Simon.
‚ÄîAh, sure, my dancing days are done, Ben... Well...
Mr Dedalus laid his pipe to rest beside the tuningfork and, sitting, touched the obedient keys.
‚ÄîNo, Simon, Father Cowley turned. Play it in the original. One flat.
The keys, obedient, rose higher, told, faltered, confessed, confused.
Up stage strode Father Cowley.
‚ÄîHere, Simon, I'll accompany you, he said. Get up.
By Graham Lemon's pineapple rock, by Elvery's elephant jingly jogged. Steak, kidney, liver, mashed, at meat fit for princes sat princes Bloom and Goulding. Princes at meat they raised and drank, Power and cider.
Most beautiful tenor air ever written, Richie said: Sonnambula. He heard Joe Maas sing that one night. Ah, what M'Guckin! Yes. In his way. Choirboy style. Maas was the boy. Massboy. A lyrical tenor if you like. Never forget it. Never.
Tenderly Bloom over liverless bacon saw the tightened features strain. Backache he. Bright's bright eye. Next item on the programme. Paying the piper. Pills, pounded bread, worth a guinea a box. Stave it off awhile. Sings too: Down among the dead men. Appropriate. Kidney pie. Sweets to the. Not making much hand of it. Best value in. Characteristic of him. Power. Particular about his drink. Flaw in the glass, fresh Vartry water. Fecking matches from counters to save. Then squander a sovereign in dribs and drabs. And when he's wanted not a farthing. Screwed refusing to pay his fare. Curious types.
Never would Richie forget that night. As long as he lived: never. In the gods of the old Royal with little Peake. And when the first note.
Speech paused on Richie's lips.
Coming out with a whopper now. Rhapsodies about damn all.
Believes his own lies. Does really. Wonderful liar. But want a good memory.
‚ÄîWhich air is that? asked Leopold Bloom.
‚ÄîAll is lost now.
Richie cocked his lips apout. A low incipient note sweet banshee murmured: all. A thrush. A throstle. His breath, birdsweet, good teeth he's proud of, fluted with plaintive woe. Is lost. Rich sound. Two notes in one there. Blackbird I heard in the hawthorn valley. Taking my motives he twined and turned them. All most too new call is lost in all. Echo. How sweet the answer. How is that done? All lost now. Mournful he whistled. Fall, surrender, lost.
Bloom bent leopold ear, turning a fringe of doyley down under the vase. Order. Yes, I remember. Lovely air. In sleep she went to him. Innocence in the moon. Brave. Don't know their danger. Still hold her back. Call name. Touch water. Jingle jaunty. Too late. She longed to go. That's why. Woman. As easy stop the sea. Yes: all is lost.
‚ÄîA beautiful air, said Bloom lost Leopold. I know it well.
Never in all his life had Richie Goulding.
He knows it well too. Or he feels. Still harping on his daughter. Wise child that knows her father, Dedalus said. Me?
Bloom askance over liverless saw. Face of the all is lost. Rollicking Richie once. Jokes old stale now. Wagging his ear. Napkinring in his eye. Now begging letters he sends his son with. Crosseyed Walter sir I did sir. Wouldn't trouble only I was expecting some money. Apologise.
Piano again. Sounds better than last time I heard. Tuned probably. Stopped again.
Dollard and Cowley still urged the ",en,LABEL_0,0.4766099154949188,LABEL_1,0.5233900547027588

Stay there and I'm sure you will find
Many ways to have a good time

They call the Rising Sun
And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy
And God, I know I'm one
My mother was a tailor
Sewed my new blue jeans
My father was a gamblin' man
Down in New Orleans
Now the only thing a gambler needs
Is a suitcase and a trunk
And the only time that he's satisfied
Is when he's on a drunk
Oh mother, tell your children
Not to do what I have done
Spend your lives in sin and misery
In the House of the Rising Sun
Well, I've got one foot on the platform
And the other foot on the train
I'm going back to New Orleans
To wear that ball and chain

And admit that the waters around you have grown
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone
If your time to you is worth saving
Then you better start swimmin' or you'll sink like a stone
For the times, they are a-changin'
Come writers and critics who prophesize with your pen
And keep your eyes wide, the chance won't come again
And don't speak too soon, for the wheel's still in spin
And there's no tellin' who that it's namin'
For the loser now will be later to win
For the times, they are a-changin'
Come senators, congressmen, please heed the call
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled
The battle outside ragin'
Will soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
For the times, they are a-changin'
Come mothers and fathers throughout the land
And don't criticize what you can't understand
Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command
Your old road is rapidly aging
Please get out of the new one if you can't lend your hand

4JvXFWVNcU8WJebrKTeqty,"Theme (From ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"")",London Music Works,136533,2,0.462,0.895,0.0863,0.936,0.104,-19.726,0.0346,78.016,0.281,"And Marius, for his part, was grave enough. The discourse of Cornelius Fronto, with its wide prospect over the human, the spiritual, horizon, had set him on a review‚Äîon a review of the isolating narrowness, in particular, of his own theoretic scheme. Long after the very latest roses were faded, when ‚Äúthe town‚Äù had departed to country villas, or the baths, or the war, he remained behind in Rome; anxious to try the lastingness of his own Epicurean rose-garden; setting to work over again, and deliberately passing from point to point of his old argument with himself, down to its practical conclusions. That age and our own have much in common‚Äîmany difficulties and hopes. Let the reader pardon me if here and there I seem to be passing from Marius to his modern representatives‚Äîfrom Rome, to Paris or London.
What really were its claims as a theory of practice, of the sympathies that determine practice? It had been a theory, avowedly, of loss and gain (so to call it) of an economy. If, therefore, it missed something in the commerce of life, which some other theory of practice was able to include, if it made a needless sacrifice, then it must be, in a manner, inconsistent with itself, and lack theoretic completeness. Did it make such a sacrifice? What did it lose, or cause one to lose?
And we may note, as Marius could hardly have done, that Cyrenaicism is ever the characteristic philosophy of youth, ardent, but narrow in its survey‚Äîsincere, but apt to become one-sided, or even fanatical. It is one of those subjective and partial ideals, based on vivid, because limited, apprehension of the truth of one aspect of experience (in this case, of the beauty of the world and the brevity of man‚Äôs life there) which it may be said to be the special vocation of the young to express. In the school of Cyrene, in that comparatively fresh Greek world, we see this philosophy where it is least blas√©, as we say; in its most pleasant, its blithest and yet perhaps its wisest form, youthfully bright in the youth of European thought. But it grows young again for a while in almost every youthful soul. It is spoken of sometimes as the appropriate utterance of jaded men; but in them it can hardly be sincere, or, by the nature of the case, an enthusiasm. ‚ÄúWalk in the ways of thine heart, and in the sight of thine eyes,‚Äù is, indeed, most often, according to the supposition of the book from which I quote it, the counsel of the young, who feel that the sunshine is pleasant along their veins, and wintry weather, though in a general sense foreseen, a long way off. The youthful enthusiasm or fanaticism, the self-abandonment to one favourite mode of thought or taste, which occurs, quite naturally, at the outset of every really vigorous intellectual career, finds its special opportunity in a theory such as that so carefully put together by Marius, just because it seems to call on one to make the sacrifice, accompanied by a vivid sensation of power and will, of what others value‚Äîsacrifice of some conviction, or doctrine, or supposed first principle‚Äîfor the sake of that clear-eyed intellectual consistency, which is like spotless bodily cleanliness, or scrupulous personal honour, and has itself for the mind of the youthful student, when he first comes to appreciate it, the fascination of an ideal.
The Cyrenaic doctrine, then, realised as a motive of strenuousness or enthusiasm, is not so properly the utterance of the ‚Äújaded Epicurean,‚Äù as of the strong young man in all the freshness of thought and feeling, fascinated by the notion of raising his life to the level of a daring theory, while, in the first genial heat of existence, the beauty of the physical world strikes potently upon his wide-open, unwearied senses. He discovers a great new poem every spring, with a hundred delightful things he too has felt, but which have never been expressed, or at least never so truly, before. The workshops of the artists, who can select and set before us what is really most distinguished in visible life, are open to him. He thinks that the old Platonic, or the new Baconian philosophy, has been better explained than by the authors themselves, or with some striking original development, this very month. In the quiet heat of early summer, on the dusty gold morning, the music comes, louder at intervals, above the hum of voices from some neighbouring church, among the flowering trees, valued now, perhaps, only for the poetically rapt faces among priests or worshippers, or the mere skill and eloquence, it may be, of its preachers of faith and righteousness. In his scrupulous idealism, indeed, he too feels himself to be something of a priest, and that devotion of his days to the contemplation of what is beautiful, a sort of perpetual religious service. Afar off, how many fair cities and delicate sea-coasts await him! At that age, with minds of a certain constitution, no very choice or exceptional circumstances are needed to provoke an enthusiasm something like this. Life in modern London even, in the heavy glow of summer, is stuff sufficient for the fresh imagination of a youth to build its ‚Äúpalace of art‚Äù of; and the very sense and enjoyment of an experience in which all is new, are but enhanced, like that glow of summer itself, by the thought of its brevity, giving him something of a gambler‚Äôs zest, in the apprehension, by dexterous act or diligently appreciative thought, of the highly coloured moments which are to pass away so quickly. At bottom, perhaps, in his elaborately developed self-consciousness, his sensibilities, his almost fierce grasp upon the things he values at all, he has, beyond all others, an inward need of something permanent in its character, to hold by: of which circumstance, also, he may be partly aware, and that, as with the brilliant Claudio in Measure for Measure, it is, in truth, but darkness he is, ‚Äúencountering, like a bride.‚Äù But the inevitable falling of the curtain is probably distant; and in the daylight, at least, it is not often that he really shudders at the thought of the grave‚Äîthe weight above, the narrow world and its company, within. When the thought of it does occur to him, he may say to himself:‚ÄîWell! and the rude monk, for instance, who has renounced all this, on the security of some dim world beyond it, really acquiesces in that ‚Äúfifth act,‚Äù amid all the consoling ministries around him, as little as I should at this moment; though I may hope, that, as at the real ending of a play, however well acted, I may already have had quite enough of it, and find a true well-being in eternal sleep.
And precisely in this circumstance, that, consistently with the function of youth in general, Cyrenaicism will always be more or less the special philosophy, or ‚Äúprophecy,‚Äù of the young, when the ideal of a rich experience comes to them in the ripeness of the receptive, if not of the reflective, powers‚Äîprecisely in this circumstance, if we rightly consider it, lies the duly prescribed corrective of that philosophy. For it is by its exclusiveness, and by negation rather than positively, that such theories fail to satisfy us permanently; and what they really need for their correction, is the complementary influence of some greater system, in which they may find their due place. That Sturm und Drang of the spirit, as it has been called, that ardent and special apprehension of half-truths, in the enthusiastic, and as it were ‚Äúprophetic‚Äù advocacy of which, devotion to truth, in the case of the young‚Äîapprehending but one point at a time in the great circumference‚Äîmost usually embodies itself, is levelled down, safely enough, afterwards, as in history so in the individual, by the weakness and mere weariness, as well as by the maturer wisdom, of our nature. And though truth indeed, resides, as has been said, ‚Äúin the whole‚Äù‚Äîin harmonisings and adjustments like this‚Äîyet those special apprehensions may still owe their full value, in this sense of ‚Äúthe whole,‚Äù to that earlier, one-sided but ardent pre-occupation with them.
Cynicism and Cyrenaicism:‚Äîthey are the earlier Greek forms of Roman Stoicism and Epicureanism, and in that world of old Greek thought, we may notice with some surprise that, in a little while, the nobler form of Cyrenaicism‚ÄîCyrenaicism cured of its faults‚Äîmet the nobler form of Cynicism half-way. Starting from opposed points, they merged, each in its most refined form, in a single ideal of temperance or moderation. Something of the same kind may be noticed regarding some later phases of Cyrenaic theory. If it starts with considerations opposed to the religious temper, which the religious temper holds it a duty to repress, it is like it, nevertheless, and very unlike any lower development of temper, in its stress and earnestness, its serious application to the pursuit of a very unworldly type of perfection. The saint, and the Cyrenaic lover of beauty, it may be thought, would at least understand each other better than either would understand the mere man of the world. Carry their respective positions a point further, shift the terms a little, and they might actually touch.
Perhaps all theories of practice tend, as they rise to their best, as understood by their worthiest representatives, to identification with each other. For the variety of men‚Äôs possible reflections on their experience, as of that experience itself, is not really so great as it seems; and as the highest and most disinterested ethical formulae, filtering down into men‚Äôs everyday existence, reach the same poor level of vulgar egotism, so, we may fairly suppose that all the highest spirits, from whatever contrasted points they have started, would yet be found to entertain, in the moral consciousness realised by themselves, much the same kind of mental company; to hold, far more than might be thought probable, at first sight, the same personal types of character, and even the same artistic and literary types, in esteem or aversion; to convey, all of them alike, the same savour of unworldliness. And Cyrenaicism or Epicureanism too, new or old, may be noticed, in proportion to the completeness of its development, to approach, as to the nobler form of Cynicism, so also to the more nobly developed phases of the old, or traditional morality. In the gravity of its conception of life, in its pursuit after nothing less than a perfection, in its apprehension of the value of time‚Äîthe passion and the seriousness which are like a consecration‚Äîla passion et le s√©rieux qui consacrent‚Äîit may be conceived, as regards its main drift, to be not so much opposed to the old morality, as an exaggeration of one special motive in it.
Some cramping, narrowing, costly preference of one part of his own nature, and of the nature of things, to another, Marius seemed to have detected in himself, meantime,‚Äîin himself, as also in those old masters of the Cyrenaic philosophy. If they did realise the monochronos h√™don√™+ as it was called‚Äîthe pleasure of the ‚ÄúIdeal Now‚Äù‚Äîif certain moments of their lives were high-pitched, passionately coloured, intent with sensation, and a kind of knowledge which, in its vivid clearness, was like sensation‚Äîif, now and then, they apprehended the world in its fulness, and had a vision, almost ‚Äúbeatific,‚Äù of ideal personalities in life and art, yet these moments were a very costly matter: they paid a great price for them, in the sacrifice of a thousand possible sympathies, of things only to be enjoyed through sympathy, from which they detached themselves, in intellectual pride, in loyalty to a mere theory that would take nothing for granted, and assent to no approximate or hypothetical truths. In their unfriendly, repellent attitude towards the Greek religion, and the old Greek morality, surely, they had been but faulty economists. The Greek religion was then alive: then, still more than in its later day of dissolution, the higher view of it was possible, even for the philosopher. Its story made little or no demand for a reasoned or formal acceptance. A religion, which had grown through and through man‚Äôs life, with so much natural strength; had meant so much for so many generations; which expressed so much of their hopes, in forms so familiar and so winning; linked by associations so manifold to man as he had been and was‚Äîa religion like this, one would think, might have had its uses, even for a philosophic sceptic. Yet those beautiful gods, with the whole round of their poetic worship, the school of Cyrene definitely renounced.
The old Greek morality, again, with all its imperfections, was certainly a comely thing.‚ÄîYes! a harmony, a music, in men‚Äôs ways, one might well hesitate to jar. The merely √¶sthetic sense might have had a legitimate satisfaction in the spectacle of that fair order of choice manners, in those attractive conventions, enveloping, so gracefully, the whole of life, insuring some sweetness, some security at least against offence, in the intercourse of the world. Beyond an obvious utility, it could claim, indeed but custom‚Äîuse-and-wont, as we say‚Äîfor its sanction. But then, one of the advantages of that liberty of spirit among the Cyrenaics (in which, through theory, they had become dead to theory, so that all theory, as such, was really indifferent to them, and indeed nothing valuable but in its tangible ministration to life) was precisely this, that it gave them free play in using as their ministers or servants, things which, to the uninitiated, must be masters or nothing. Yet, how little the followers of Aristippus made of that whole comely system of manners or morals, then actually in possession of life, is shown by the bold practical consequence, which one of them maintained (with a hard, self-opinionated adherence to his peculiar theory of values) in the not very amiable paradox that friendship and patriotism were things one could do without; while another‚ÄîDeath‚Äôs-advocate, as he was called‚Äîhelped so many to self-destruction, by his pessimistic eloquence on the evils of life, that his lecture-room was closed. That this was in the range of their consequences‚Äîthat this was a possible, if remote, deduction from the premisses of the discreet Aristippus‚Äîwas surely an inconsistency in a thinker who professed above all things an economy of the moments of life. And yet those old Cyrenaics felt their way, as if in the dark, we may be sure, like other men in the ordinary transactions of life, beyond the narrow limits they drew of clear and absolutely legitimate knowledge, admitting what was not of immediate sensation, and drawing upon that ‚Äúfantastic‚Äù future which might never come. A little more of such ‚Äúwalking by faith,‚Äù a little more of such not unreasonable ‚Äúassent,‚Äù and they might have profited by a hundred services to their culture, from Greek religion and Greek morality, as they actually were. The spectacle of their fierce, exclusive, tenacious hold on their own narrow apprehension, makes one think of a picture with no relief, no soft shadows nor breadth of space, or of a drama without proportionate repose.
Yet it was of perfection that Marius (to return to him again from his masters, his intellectual heirs) had been really thinking all the time: a narrow perfection it might be objected, the perfection of but one part of his nature‚Äîhis capacities of feeling, of exquisite physical impressions, of an imaginative sympathy‚Äîbut still, a true perfection of those capacities, wrought out to their utmost degree, admirable enough in its way. He too is an economist: he hopes, by that ‚Äúinsight‚Äù of which the old Cyrenaics made so much, by skilful apprehension of the conditions of spiritual success as they really are, the special circumstances of the occasion with which he has to deal, the special felicities of his own nature, to make the most, in no mean or vulgar sense, of the few years of life; few, indeed, for the attainment of anything like general perfection! With the brevity of that sum of years his mind is exceptionally impressed; and this purpose makes him no frivolous dilettante, but graver than other men: his scheme is not that of a trifler, but rather of one who gives a meaning of his own, yet a very real one, to those old words‚ÄîLet us work while it is day! He has a strong apprehension, also, of the beauty of the visible things around him; their fading, momentary, graces and attractions. His natural susceptibility in this direction, enlarged by experience, seems to demand of him an almost exclusive pre-occupation with the aspects of things; with their √¶sthetic character, as it is called‚Äîtheir revelations to the eye and the imagination: not so much because those aspects of them yield him the largest amount of enjoyment, as because to be occupied, in this way, with the √¶sthetic or imaginative side of things, is to be in real contact with those elements of his own nature, and of theirs, which, for him at least, are matter of the most real kind of apprehension. As other men are concentrated upon truths of number, for instance, or on business, or it may be on the pleasures of appetite, so he is wholly bent on living in that full stream of refined sensation. And in the prosecution of this love of beauty, he claims an entire personal liberty, liberty of heart and mind, liberty, above all, from what may seem conventional answers to first questions.
But, without him there is a venerable system of sentiment and idea, widely extended in time and place, in a kind of impregnable possession of human life‚Äîa system, which, like some other great products of the conjoint efforts of human mind through many generations, is rich in the world‚Äôs experience; so that, in attaching oneself to it, one lets in a great tide of that experience, and makes, as it were with a single step, a great experience of one‚Äôs own, and with great consequent increase to one‚Äôs sense of colour, variety, and relief, in the spectacle of men and things. The mere sense that one belongs to a system‚Äîan imperial system or organisation‚Äîhas, in itself, the expanding power of a great experience; as some have felt who have been admitted from narrower sects into the communion of the catholic church; or as the old Roman citizen felt. It is, we might fancy, what the coming into possession of a very widely spoken language might be, with a great literature, which is also the speech of the people we have to live among.
A wonderful order, actually in possession of human life!‚Äîgrown inextricably through and through it; penetrating into its laws, its very language, its mere habits of decorum, in a thousand half-conscious ways; yet still felt to be, in part, an unfulfilled ideal; and, as such, awakening hope, and an aim, identical with the one only consistent aspiration of mankind! In the apprehension of that, just then, Marius seemed to have joined company once more with his own old self; to have overtaken on the road the pilgrim who had come to Rome, with absolute sincerity, on the search for perfection. It defined not so much a change of practice, as of sympathy‚Äîa new departure, an expansion, of sympathy. It involved, certainly, some curtailment of his liberty, in concession to the actual manner, the distinctions, the enactments of that great crowd of admirable spirits, who have elected so, and not otherwise, in their conduct of life, and are not here to give one, so to term it, an ‚Äúindulgence.‚Äù But then, under the supposition of their disapproval, no roses would ever seem worth plucking again. The authority they exercised was like that of classic taste‚Äîan influence so subtle, yet so real, as defining the loyalty of the scholar; or of some beautiful and venerable ritual, in which every observance is become spontaneous and almost mechanical, yet is found, the more carefully one considers it, to have a reasonable significance and a natural history.
And Marius saw that he would be but an inconsistent Cyrenaic, mistaken in his estimate of values, of loss and gain, and untrue to the well-considered economy of life which he had brought with him to Rome‚Äîthat some drops of the great cup would fall to the ground‚Äîif he did not make that concession, if he did but remain just there.Embed",en,LABEL_0,0.5408464074134827,LABEL_1,0.4591536223888397

All in all, it's just another brick in the wall
All in all, you're just another brick in the wall
We don't need no education
We don't need no thought control
No dark sarcasm in the classroom
Teachers, leave them kids alone
Hey! Teacher! Leave us kids alone!

All in all, you're just another brick in the wall
All in all, you're just another brick in the wall

And disciplinary remains mercifully
Yes and um, I‚Äôm with you Derek, this star nonsense
Yes, yes, now which is it?
I am sure of it

So, so you think you can tell
Heaven from Hell? Blue skies from pain?
Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail?
A smile from a veil? Do you think you can tell?
Did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees? Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change? Did you exchange
A walk-on part in the war for a lead role in a cage?


How I wish, how I wish you were here
We're just two lost souls swimming in a fishbowl, year after year
Running over the same old ground, what have we found?
The same old fears, wish you were here

On the first part of the journey
I was looking at all the life
There were plants and birds and rocks and things
There was sand and hills and rings
The first thing I met was a fly with a buzz
And the sky with no clouds
The heat was hot and the ground was dry
But the air was full of sound

I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
It felt good to be out of the rain
In the desert you can remember your name
'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain
La, la, la lala la la la, la, la
La, la, la lala la la la, la, la

After two days in the desert sun
My skin began to turn red
After three days in the desert fun
I was looking at a river bed
And the story it told of a river that flowed
Made me sad to think it was dead

La, la, la lala la la la, la, la


After nine days I let the horse run free
'Cause the desert had turned to sea
There were plants and birds and rocks and things
There was sand and hills and rings
The ocean is a desert with its life underground
And a perfect disguise above
Under the cities lies a heart made of ground
But the humans will give no love

You see, I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
It felt good to be out of the rain
In the desert you can remember your name
'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain

We are young, we run green
Keep our teeth nice and clean
See our friends, see the sights
And feel alright

We wake up, we go out
Smoke a fag, put it out
See our friends, see the sights
And feel alright

Are we like you?
I can't be sure
Of the scene as she turns
We are strange in our worlds

But we are young, we get by
Can't go mad, ain't got time
Sleep around if we like
But we're alright

Got some cash, bought some wheels
Took it out 'cross the fields
Lost control, hit a wall
But we're alright

It was a teenage wedding
And the old folks wished them well
You could see that Pierre did truly love the mademoiselle
And now the young monsieur and madame
Have rung the chapel bell
""C'est la vie"", say the old folks
It goes to show you never can tell

They furnished off an apartment with
A two room Roebuck sale
The coolerator was crammed with TV dinners and ginger ale
But when Pierre found work, the little money comin' worked out well
""C'est la vie"", say the old folks
It goes to show you never can tell

They had a hi-fi phono, boy, did they let it blast
Seven hundred little records
All rock, rhythm and jazz
But when the sun went down
The rapid tempo of the music fell
""C'est la vie"", say the old folks
It goes to show you never can tell

The red sandstone, it fell
Right smack on top of Sedona Arabelle
When John Ford said, ""Won't you hop on in?""
And the Stagecoach baby gonna take you for a spin, oh whoa
Whoa whoa

Well hey little Hollywood
You're gone but you're not forgot
You got the cash but your credit's no good
You flipped the script and you shot the plot
And I remember, I remember when the neon used to burn so bright and pink
Saturday night kind of pink

Well the blacklist and its hosts
He came down so swift
And you drove him to the coast
We're going California but we're all out of work
I guess that's better than a grave and a hearse, oh whoa
Whoa whoa

Hey little Hollywood

I cried myself to sleep last night
And the ghost of Carl, he approached my window
I was hypnotized, I was asked
To improvise
On the attitude, the regret
Of a thousand centuries of death
Even with the heart of terror and the superstitious wearer
I am riding all alone
I am writing all alone
Even in my best condition, counting all the superstition
I am riding all alone
I am running all alone
And we laughed at the beatitudes of a thousand lines
We were asked at the attitudes
They reminded us of death
Even with the rest belated, everything is antiquated
Are you writing from the heart?

Even in his heart the Devil has to know the water level
Are you writing from the heart?

She's got a smile that it seems, to me
Reminds me of childhood memories
Where everything was as fresh as the bright blue sky (Sky)
Now and then, when I see her face
She takes me away to that special place
And if I stared too long, I'd probably break down and cry

Woah-woah-woah
Sweet child of mine
Woah, oh-oh-oh
Sweet love of mine

She's got eyes of the bluest skies
As if they thought of rain
I'd hate to look into those eyes and see an ounce of pain
Her hair reminds me of a warm, safe place
Where as a child, I'd hide
And pray for the thunder and the rain to quietly pass me by

I'm gonna fight 'em off
A seven nation army couldn't hold me back
They're gonna rip it off
Takin' their time right behind my back
And I'm talkin' to myself at night because I can't forget
Back and forth through my mind, behind a cigarette

And the message comin' from my eyes says, ""Leave it alone""

Don't want to hear about it
Every single one's got a story to tell
Everyone knows about it
From the Queen of England to the Hounds of Hell
And if I catch it comin' back my way, I'm gonna serve it to you
And that ain't what you want to hear, but that's what I'll do

And the feelin' comin' from my bones says, ""Find a home""

And there's a cold, lonely light that shines from you
You'll wind up like the wreck you hide behind that mask you use
And did you think this fool could never win?
Well look at me, I'm a-comin' back again
I got a taste of love in a simple way
And if you need to know while I'm still standin'
You just fade away

Don't you know I'm still standin' better than I ever did?
Lookin' like a true survivor, feelin' like a little kid

I see a red door and I want it painted black
No colours anymore, I want them to turn black
I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes

I see a line of cars and they're all painted black
With flowers and my love, both never to come back
I see people turn their heads and quickly look away
Like a newborn baby, it just happens every day

I look inside myself and see my heart is black
I see my red door, I must have it painted black
Maybe then I'll fade away and not have to face the facts
It's not easy facing up when your whole world is black

No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue
I could not foresee this thing happening to you

My love will laugh with me before the morning comes

Neurotic to the bone, no doubt about it

Am I just paranoid
Or am I just stoned?

And I went to a shrink

Bought it at the five and dime
Played it 'til my fingers bled
Was the summer of '69

Me and some guys from school
Had a band and we tried real hard

That summer seemed to last forever
And if I had the choice
Yeah, I'd always wanna be there

Turn it up

Big wheels keep on turnin'
Carry me home to see my kin
Singin' songs about the southland
I miss Alabamy once again
And I think it's a sin, yes

Well, I heard Mr. Young sing about her (Southern man)
Well, I heard ol' Neil put her down
Well, I hope Neil Young will remember
A Southern man don't need him around, anyhow

Sweet home Alabama

Sweet home Alabama
Lord, I'm coming home to you

In Birmingham they loved the governor
Boo! Boo! Boo!

A mi boy, el clima c√°lido (Oh)
Llegamo' en el party bus, nos ven y quedan p√°lido'

Aunque la llamo en an√≥nimo, eso no le cambia el √°nimo
Antes de ti y despu√©' habr√°n m√°', pero olvidarte yo a ti jam√°'
Me dijo que le excita mi voz, le hablo al o√≠do y la dejo mal

It's not confidential, I've got potential

Ready, let's roll onto somethin' new
Takin' its toll then I'm leaving without you

'Cause heaven ain't close in a place like this
I said, oh, heaven ain't close in a place like this
Bring it back down, bring it back down tonight (Ooh-ooh)
Never thought I'd let a rumor ruin my moonlight

Broken hearts lie all around me
And I don't see an easy way to get out of this

I just died in your arms tonight
Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been some kind of kiss
I should've walked away, I should've walked away
Is there any just 'cause for feeling like this?
On the surface, I'm a name on a list
I try to be discreet, but then blow it again
I've lost and found, it's my final mistake

I lost my own belief
Always somethin' breakin' me, was overcome
Walkin' these lonely streets
Even in good company, I want to run

But now I'm embracin' the way I am
I don't need nobody to hold my hand

I'm doin' it, doin' it all by myself
I'm movin' it, movin' it all by myself
I'll be my own motivation
I'll listen to nothin' they're sayin'
I'm lovin' me, lovin' me all by myself

All by myself
All by myself, myself
All by my‚Äî

They turned the best of me into my insecurities
They shout so loud
No parties with fake friends
I never wanna blend into the crowd

Yo la rescato siempre que tarde se escapa
Dice que se va a estudiar y su amiga la tapa
Con √©l se aguanta las gana' y conmigo las mata
Ya llega f√°cil sin el GPS a mi apa
Yo la rescato siempre que tarde se escapa
Dice que se va a estudiar y su amiga la tapa
Con √©l se aguanta las gana' y conmigo las mata
Ya llega f√°cil sin el GPS a mi apa

Cuando vi ese culo le di gracia' a Dio'
Al fin me escuch√≥ mis plegar√≠a'
Vida de artista y t√∫ de universitaria
T√∫ de PR, pero yo de Canaria'
En mi cama tengo una vacante beb√©, dime si quieres ser mi becaria
No eres droga, pero tu dosis se me ha hecho necesaria
Pa' llegar a mi apa no le hace falta ni GPS
Los jeans skinny, mami, y en el cuello VVS
Ella se prepar√≥, en casa dej√≥ la timidez
Eres la baby con la que so√±aba en mi ni√±ez
Y nadie niega que t√∫ est√°s bien dura
Las curva' marc√°', peque√±a la cintura
Tiene tatuada en la espalda una luna
Fuma pa' olvidar a ese bobo que na' le suma
Y su marido la espera siempre en casa enfada'o
Le pregunta: ""Dime, ¬ød√≥nde has esta'o?""
Y ella no le responde aunque tiene mi nombre en su mente y el polvo tatua'o

Ser perra est√° de moda, que no le hablen de boda'
Ella se port√≥ mal y tuve que amarrarla con soga
En la cama se gradu√≥ y tuve que ponerle la toga
Dijo que quer√≠a algo relax y yo la puse a hacer yoga
Aquel le pelea y llega sola directo a mi apartamento
Buscando desquitarse y ese e' mi departamento
Ese cuerpo es perfecto, dime qui√©n fue el arquitecto
Ese culo est√° caro, pero a m√≠ me da descuento
Me sobran razone' pa' darte sin condone'
Te perd√≠ ya una vez, culpa de malas decisione'
Por darte estoy ansioso, t√∫ mirando y yo nervioso
Se fue pa' Europa, subi√≥ de precio como un coso

Born down in a dead man's town
The first kick I took was when I hit the ground
You end up like a dog that's been beat too much
'Til you spend half your life just covering up, now
Born in the U.S.A.¬†
I was born in the U.S.A.¬†
I was born in the U.S.A.¬†
Born in the U.S.A. now¬†

Got in a little hometown jam
So they put a rifle in my hand
Sent me off to a foreign land
To go and kill the yellow man
Born in the U.S.A.¬†
I was born in the U.S.A.¬†
I was born in the U.S.A.¬†
I was born in the U.S.A.¬†

Come back home to the refinery
Hiring man says, ‚ÄúSon, if it was up to me‚Äù
Went down to see my V.A. man
He said, ‚ÄúSon, don't you understand‚Äù

I had a brother at Khe Sanh
Fighting off them Viet Cong
They're still there, he's all gone
He had a woman he loved in Saigon
I got a picture of him in her arms now
Down in the shadow of the penitentiary
Out by the gas fires of the refinery
I'm ten years burning down the road
Nowhere to run, ain't got nowhere to go
Born in the U.S.A.¬†
I was born in the U.S.A. now

Vivo en mi base y la paz no me la tumban (Wuh)

'Tamo en el guayateo, ya m√°s suelta te veo
Hay fiesta y rumba, hay fiesta y rumba
Llama al 911, nos prendimo' en fuego (¬°Rumba!)
Hay fiesta y rumba, hay fiesta y rumba
Las pena' se van y no se dejan pa' luego

Yo me ca√≠, igual que t√∫ y me levant√© (Sigo de pie)
Poquito a poco to' ese mal lo super√© (¬øO√≠ste?)
En un d√≠a no se quiere (¬°No!), tampoco en do' se olvida (S√∫belo)
Comoquiera, hay que vivir la vida, as√≠ que dale movimiento y
B√°ilame (¬°Rumba!)
Vamos a amanecerno' bailando (Baila conmigo)
B√°ilame
Que las pena' se olvidan bailando
B√°ilame
Que el pasado ya se va
Y contigo solo quiero yo bailar el reggaet√≥n
Bailemo' reggaet√≥n

De la'o a la'o, de la'o a la'o (¬°Rumba!)
Bailemo' reggaet√≥n
De la'o a la'o, de la'o a la'o (De la'o)

Drinking without you
(Mmm)
Doesn't fix me but it kinda helps

Oh, I still wish we could go back to where we started
When you left your T-shirt at my old apartment
Have you ever wondered if you loved me harder
Where we'd be, where we'd be now?

Yeah, we got so close, so close to love
But you had to go and mess it up
Was it all too much or just not enough?

Run up the tab and lose control

No, we ain't got plans like we had back then
Takes me back to how we used to feel

We all came out to Montreux
On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
But Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground

Smoke on the water
And fire in the sky
Smoke on the water

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race

We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty, cold and bare
But with the Rolling-truck-Stones-thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights, a few old beds
We made a place to sweat
No matter what, we get out of this
I know, I know we'll never forget

Smoke on the water
And fire in the sky

T√∫ ere' traviesa
Pero si en mi camino te atraviesa'
Te voy a devorar de pie' a cabeza
Y le doy con fortaleza
Trasero grande por naturaleza
Otra fiera me encontr√© por la maleza
Mu√©vete jevi como una stripper
Dale, mami, no te quite'
No e' interes√°', pero no le hable' si no tiene' ticke'
No falla que ponga un caption y que las dem√°' se piquen
'T√° soltera y 't√° buscando que le aplique
Si te vas con otro, mami, no soy rencoroso
Me ver√°s pas√°ndote por al frente como con ocho
La nota me tiene viendo la disco slow motion
En el VIP quer√≠a darme un blowjob, ey
Quiere que le d√© sin pena, ey

Pa' capotear siempre se pone mis cadena', ah-ah (Yandel; jaja)

¬øD√≥nde est√°n las mujere' soltera'?
Alza la mano si est√°' buena, ah
Escucha el bajo c√≥mo suena
Mira ese culo c√≥mo lo menea

Y t√∫ te pega', yo me pego y te bes√©
T√∫ quisiste, yo no fue que te forc√©
Con los ojo' arrebata'o cuando la conoce'
Me dice que no me reconoce
Yo estaba bien vola'o, contigo aterric√©
Grita m√°' que una Bos√©
Una nota bien cabrona, son las 5:12
Pero ella conmigo amanece (¬°Bicho al Callao! ¬°Woeeh!)
Ella est√° bien dura, anda sin cirug√≠a pl√°stica (Wuh)
En la calle nos matamo', en la cama tenemo' qu√≠mica
Es simp√°tica, se pone media bicha, bien sarc√°stica (Prr)
Hay mucha' que la critican porque el booty e' de f√°brica (Ah)

Ella e' met√°lica (Met√°lica), no usa r√©plica (R√©plica)
Escucha reggaet√≥n con ropa g√≥tica (G√≥tica)
Va a la est√©tica (Uh), est√° bien rica (Ah)

Ella e' met√°lica (Met√°lica), no usa r√©plica (R√©plica)
Escucha reggaet√≥n con ropa g√≥tica (G√≥tica)
Va a la est√©tica (Uh), est√° bien rica (Ah)
No tira puya' y comoquiera se pican (Yeah-eh-eh; prr)

Ella no coge eso, siempre anda con la corta
No fuma, tiene sei' amiga' de escolta
No e' milloneta, pero mala vida no se da
Tan chula, hace travesura' de verda' (Yeah)
Es media ex√≥tica, una bichiyal (Bichiyal)
Cuando empieza en la cama no quiere parar (No quiere parar)
Quiere acaparar (Quiere acaparar), su amiga invitar
Pero yo soy un bellaco, t√∫ sabe' que vo'a matar
As√≠ como pa' lo' dosmile' (Yeah)
Haciendo historia como pa' lo' tiempo' 'e Los Beatles ('E Los Beatles)
Por favor, no hay uno que conmigo se mide (Se mide)

Es media ex√≥tica, una bichiyal (Eh)
Cuando empieza en la cama no quiere parar (No quiere parar)
Quiere acaparar (Yeah-eh-eh-eh), su amiga invitar
Pero yo soy un bellaco, t√∫ sabe' que vo'a matar
Yeah (¬°W!)
Se pasa fronte√°ndome (¬°Tra!)
Se apaga la luz (¬°Eh!)
¬øQui√©n rompi√≥ la disco? Yo le digo: ""Fuistes t√∫"" (Tra, tra)
Otra vez (Tra, tra, tra) se fue en un viaje (Yeah)
Duro pa'l piso (¬°Tra!), sin camuflaje (¬°Eh!)
Contra el muro (¬°Duro!)
Y aguanta que uno le d√© duro (¬°Ah!)
Ella es un tanque de guerra, manito, te lo juro (¬°Pr√©ndelo!)
Yo la pillo en la esquina y en seguida la aseguro
Me da la verde y nos matamos en lo oscuro (¬°Doble!)
Flow, replique' el mambo, que lleg√≥ el m√°s poderoso (¬°Prende!)
Yo sigo rompiendo y eso te tiene furioso (¬°Duro!)
Si la' gata' bailan en la pista, fabuloso (¬°¬øQu√©?!)
T√≠renme, muchachos, que yo no soy rencoroso

D√≠melo, ¬øqu√© vas a hacer
Si me hago due√±o de tu piel?
Si por la noche te hago enloquecer
D√≠melo, ¬øqu√© vas a hacer?
D√≠melo, ¬øqu√© vas a hacer

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song
Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrainYou might also likeEmbed",en,LABEL_0,0.5209752321243286,LABEL_1,0.4790247082710266

The victorious Gingrich army of well-trained, well-funded ""conservatives"" call for a Contract with America that will finally ""get government off our backs"" so that we can return to the happy days when the free market reigned. They will restore ""family values,"" ridding us of ""the excesses of the welfare state"" and the other residues of the failed ""big government"" policies of New Deal liberalism and Johnson's ""Great Society."" By dismantling the ""nanny state"" they will succeed, where the Democrats have failed, to achieve the shared goal of all elite and leadership elements: to ""create jobs for Americans"" and win security and freedom for the ""middle class."" And they will take over and successfully lead the crusade to establish the American Dream of free market democracy, worldwide.
One of the great achievements of contemporary ideological warfare has been to debase the terms of political discourse so thoroughly that such statements as these are not entirely false, if we keep to what has become conventional usage. As Orwell predicted, this achievement has undermined the possibility even of talking sensibly about what is happening in the world. Still, independent minds -- including any authentic conservatives who might be located in the outer reaches of the political arena or intellectual world -- can refuse to be swept up in the fashionable currents and use terms with their actual meanings to describe what is happening, and why.
1. The Triumph of Conservatism
Most of this, we also heard just ten years ago, when Reagan was elected by a 2-1 vote, the second ""conservative landslide"" in four years. In his 1980 triumph, presidential historian William Leuchtenberg observed, ""Reagan, far from having won in a landslide, got little more than a bare majority of the popular vote and only 28% of the potential electorate, and exit polls showed that the vote was not ""for Reagan"" but ""against Carter,"" who had in fact initiated the policies that the Reaganites took up and implemented, with the general support of congressional Democrats: accelerating military spending (meaning, in particular, the state sector of the economy) while cutting back programs that aid the vast majority. Polls in 1980 revealed that 11% of Reagan voters chose him because ""he's a real conservative"" -- whatever that term is supposed to mean.
In 1984, despite vast attempts to get out the vote, the totals increased by 1%. The percentage who chose Reagan because he was a ""real conservative"" dropped to 4%, while 70% of all voters with an opinion on the matter opposed Reaganite legislative programs, and public opinion studies showed a continuation of the steady drift towards a kind of New Deal-style welfare state liberalism on the part of the general population. Their concerns and desires were not articulated in the political system, however; one reason, surely, why voting was so sharply skewed towards privileged sectors.
The reasons why voting is so dramatically an elite affair in the United States are revealed by comparative studies. Analysis of thirty democracies showed ""a significant correlation between high voter turnout and the presence of political parties representing clearly defined strata of society -- that is, parties strongly tied to specific income classes, religious groupings, or language groups"" (political commentator Thomas Edsall, 1984). In economic policy, Edsall added, the U.S. political system fails to represent ""the interests of the bottom three-fifths of society."" To use a phrase that is unspeakable in polite society without shock quotes, when the ""class interests"" of the privileged and powerful are the guiding commitment of all political parties, people who do not share these interests tend to stay home. The class pattern of abstention ""seems inseparably linked to another crucial comparative peculiarity of the American political system,"" political scientist William Dean Burnham observed: ""the total absence of a socialist or laborite party as an organized competitor in the electoral market."" That absence relates to and is fortified by the effective dismantling of civil society: unions, political organizations, and so on.1
In the 1980s, the U.S. and Britain took the lead in the ""triumph of conservatism,"" accelerating processes already underway. They therefore lead the developed world in impoverishment and degradation, inequality, homelessness, destruction of family values, hunger, and other values of contemporary ""conservatism."" A study by the British charitable organization Action for Children, founded in 1869 with the Queen as patron, concludes that ""the gap between rich and poor is as wide today as it was in Victorian times,"" and in some ways worse. A million and a half families cannot afford to provide their children with ""the diet fed to a similar child living in a Bethnal Green Workhouse in 1876,"" a ""sad reflection on British society."" Britain has proportionately more children living in poverty than any European country apart from Portugal and Ireland, and the proportion is rising faster than any country in Europe, though the U.S. still holds the lead.
Britain has also not yet matched the achievements of the doctrinal system crafted by our highly class conscious business community, with the assistance of those whom the lively 19th century working class press called ""the bought priesthood"" of respectable intellectuals. The fact that there is ""class conflict"" and that the rich and powerful mobilize state power to serve their interests, a truism to Adam Smith, remains within popular consciousness. The 1994 Gallup Political and Economic Index gives interesting information about popular attitudes on these matters (I put aside small numbers, 3%-10%, expressing no opinion). The study reports that over four-fifths of the population think ""there is a class struggle in this country"" and that ""too little"" is being done ""to level up the classes."" Two-thirds ""disagree strongly"" with the statement ""Britain is a classless society."" Nine out of ten feel that the Government does ""too little"" for ""the working class,"" four-fifths that it does ""too much"" for ""the well-to-do,"" and over 90% that it does ""too little"" for ""people living on small pensions/income."" Half also think it does ""too little"" for ""the middle classes."" Three-fourths ""think of Britain as divided into haves and have-nots,"" and a third describe themselves as among ""the haves.""2
Let's return to 1994, the next in the series of ""conservative landslides,"" this time under the leadership of Newt Gingrich. ""Republicans claimed about 52 percent of all votes cast for candidates in contested House seats, slightly better than a two-point improvement from 1992"" (Richard Morin, director of polling for the Washington Post). One out of six voters described the outcome as ""an affirmation of the Republican agenda""; 60% said it ""was a repudiation of the Democrats."" A ""more conservative Congress"" was considered to be an issue by a rousing 12% of the voters. An ""overwhelming majority had never heard of"" the Gingrich Contract with America, articulating the Republican agenda, though a majority opposed one of its central components: ""defense increases,"" a code-word for public subsidies to advanced industry. The chief pollster of the Los Angeles Times pointed out that just before the election, 61% of those polled said ""that spending for domestic programs should be increased.""
All of this echoes the situation of a decade ago.
The opposition to Democrats is more nuanced. Clinton-style ""New Democrats"" -- in effect, moderate Republicans -- ""lost their seats at twice the rate of their more liberal colleagues,"" Ken Silverstein and Alexander Cockburn report. The ""more liberal"" Democrats are those who tried to activate the old Democratic coalition of working people, women, the poor: the majority of the population who see themselves, correctly, as effectively disenfranchised.
To put these figures in further perspective, it must be recalled that voting was even more heavily skewed towards the wealthy and privileged than before. As compared with 1992, 7% more voters were wealthy, 7% fewer were working class, political scientist Peter Levine comments, noting also that Democrats were overwhelmingly preferred by voters who earn less than $30,000 a year and ran even with Republicans in the $30,000-$49,000 range. There was also a very large gender and color gap, white males voting mostly Republican, while women, Blacks and Hispanics voted for Democrats (overwhelmingly, in the Black-Hispanic category, where participation was low). Those with no more than high school education, along with those with postgraduate education, favored Democrats. Those who sensed a decline in their standard of living voted for Republicans by close to two to one -- mostly white males with just high school degrees ""whose economic futures are highly uncertain,"" Thomas Edsall observes; just those who would have been part of a left-populist coalition committed to equitable economic growth and political democracy, were such an option to intrude into our business-run political system.
The message, however, was just the opposite: Clinton must abandon the left-wing agenda that the voters had just overwhelmingly rejected and return to what he had promised to be in 1992: a ""New Democrat."" And he was quick to pick up the cues. In a satellite address to the National League of cities, ""Clinton used some variation of the words `work,' `jobs' or `working families' more than 40 times as he raised `New Democrat' themes such as welfare reform, national service, lifelong job training, and the need to `attack problems that feed dependency',"" the Boston Globe reported under the headline: ""Clinton seen returning to `New Democrat' stance."" The report didn't say when he had left that stance for some different one, on any issue of importance to rich and powerful. If he had, Business Week hadn't noticed. ""Corporate America did fine riding in tandem with Clinton,"" the journal reports, though ""it did equally well when they diverged.""
Despite all his efforts to please, still business ""basically hates the Clinton Administration,"" Business Week continues, and gives him ""little credit"" for advancing the corporate agenda. Why? The reasons they give, and cite from polls of executives, are hard to take seriously. But there is one very good reason. Leading sectors of wealth and privilege taste blood. They think, with some reason, that they have the world's population by the throat, and are in a position to roll back the hated welfare state for the general population and everything that goes with it: health and safety standards, labor rights and human rights generally, indeed any infringement on their right to pursue ""the vile maxim,"" as Adam Smith described the goal of the masters: ""all for ourselves, and nothing for other people."" Given that awareness, it makes sense to ""hate"" anyone who may have a somewhat flawed commitment to the sole human value: ""Gain Wealth, forgetting all but Self,"" ""the New Spirit of the Age"" denounced by the lively and vigorous working class press 150 years ago, as working people fought to save human values from the rising tide of private tyranny.3
Yet another factor, scarcely noted here, has to be taken into account in evaluating the electoral results. Under the headline ""Big money still garners the big vote,"" George Graham observed in the London Financial Times that money ""spoke as loud as ever in the most expensive campaign on record."" With a few notable exceptions, electoral victory tracked campaign financing closely -- again, no departure from the norm and natural in a political system in which the less affluent majority does not participate and is scarcely represented.4
Voters selected ""welfare reform"" as their top priority, with health care reform second and crime also ranking high. These choices, which in part reflect a grasp of reality, also have to be understood against the background of recent propaganda offensives.
To begin with reality, for most of the population, conditions of life and work are grim and declining, something new in the history of industrial society. Median income declined even during the ""Clinton recovery,"" falling to 7% below the 1989 level by late 1993, the Census Bureau reported. The decline was accompanied by -- and in no small measure caused by -- much-lauded improvements in ""flexibility of labor markets."" The latter is a technical term referring to elimination of job security and other such ""market rigidities"" that interfere with ""economic health,"" another ideological construct. As designed for the purposes of population control, ""economic health"" is unrelated to the welfare of the population but crafted to measure what is valued by the rich: speculators, bond holders, investors, professionals who serve the state-corporate sector. Continuing the decline during the Reagan years, after a decade of stagnation, pay for private sector employees fell 4% from 1988 to 1994, with blue collar wages suffering most and white collar wages still below 1990 and well below 1988. Despite much misleading hype, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports a continuing ""shift to lower-wage industries and higher wage-occupations,"" executive and professional, while noting that the overwhelming majority of these are in lower-paid service industries (motel manager, and the like). That means sharply increased inequality, with the majority suffering reductions in absolute terms along with much worse work conditions.5
But some folks are doing just fine. ""The percentage of corporate income devoted to payrolls is hovering near a record low,"" Fortune magazine reported in November, having dropped sharply during the ""conservative landslide"" of the early 1980s, and again since 1992. With the ""New Democrats"" at the helm, ""1993 was a bracingly upbeat year for the FORTUNE 500,"" the journal exulted in its April 1994 annual review of the state of the important people, who posted ""dazzling"" profits despite ""virtually stagnant"" sales growth. The ecstatic story was headed: ""Hats Off! It Was a Heck of a Year"" -- at least, for those who matter.6
While in part realistic, the expressed concerns of voters reflect the great victories of the ideological warfare that has been conducted with relentless intensity since the early 1970s in the effort to overcome the perceived ""crisis of democracy."" Across the political spectrum, privileged sectors were naturally appalled by the attempts of the great majority of the population to escape from the apathy and marginalization that is their proper place and to enter the political arena, forgetting that in a democracy the role of the ""ignorant and meddlesome outsiders"" is to be mere ""spectators,"" not ""participants,"" as Walter Lippmann put it in his progressive essays on democracy 70 years ago, expressing the doctrines of ""Wilsonian idealism."" It therefore became necessary to renew with much greater intensity the constant campaign to tame and cage that ""great beast,"" as Alexander Hamilton termed the ""people"" with horror and indignation as he was laying the foundations for state-guided industrial democracy. The beast may not yet be tamed, but it is being caged; sometimes quite literally, sometimes in chains of dogma and deceit, an important victory.
We may recall, in passing, that fear of democracy and freedom has always been one of the factors motivating the terror and sometimes outright aggression undertaken to eliminate ""rotten apples"" that might ""spoil the barrel"" and ""viruses"" that might ""infect others,"" in the terminology favored by leading planners -- the main concern, of course, being independence, whatever cast it takes. That helps explain the passion of Washington's terrorist wars in Central America in recent years, or to take a current example, Washington's not-so-tacit support for its trainees and associates in the Haitian military as they did their necessary work, and the restoration of the rule of their backers among the Haitian elite under the guise of ""democracy,"" now that the work is done and the Generals can be sent off to the life of luxury, which, they understood correctly, would be their reward for services rendered. Behind the supercilious racist rhetoric about ""civilizing Aristide"" and teaching him ""lessons in democracy"" lies a real fear: that the democratic virus in Haiti might even infect these shores. People here might realize that we have a great deal to learn about democracy from the peasants and slum-dwellers of Haiti, who constructed a vibrant civil society that offered the ""great beast"" a chance to take some control over their lives. Their crime brings to mind the call for freedom for all people that was sounded for the first time in Haiti two centuries ago, outraging the civilized opinion of that day.
One consequence of the huge propaganda campaigns of the past several decades is the mood of ""antipolitics"" reported in feature stories. Concealed from public view is the fact that ""politics is the shadow cast on society by big business,"" as John Dewey stated the truism familiar at least since Adam Smith, adding that as long as this is so, ""the attenuation of the shadow will not change the substance."" Reforms are of limited utility. Democracy requires that the source of the shadow be removed, not only because of its domination of the political arena, but because the very institutions of private power undermine democracy and freedom; again, an observation familar back to the Founding Fathers.
But the source of the shadow has to be driven from the mind. Naturally, this is a leading theme of the literature of the ultraright foundations that are seeking to drive the educational system and media towards an even narrower fringe of the permissible spectrum. At the other extreme, Clinton campaign literature spoke movingly about workers and their firms and how government must help them; missing from the picture were bosses, profits, investors, and the like. There are ""entrepreneurs,"" nice folk who appear now and then to help the workers and their firms. They then sink into the background along with the unmentionables, who are laboring for the common good, selflessly seeking to provide jobs and decent lives for ordinary people in the ""civil society"" in which all participate.7
The fanaticism of the effort to conceal the obvious has reached comic proportions. After the latest APEC summit in Jakarta in November, front-page headlines announced that ""Clinton Is Stern With Indonesia On Rights but Gleeful on Trade"" (New York Times). The ""sternness on rights"" consisted of a few whimpers denounced by Indonesian human rights activists and labor leaders (those still out of jail), but the Glee on Trade was real enough. It reflects the successes of ""the Administration's campaign of commercial diplomacy"" that ""will mean jobs for Americans,"" Times political correspondent Elaine Sciolino reported with admiration. Clinton firmed up $40 billion in joint projects in his campaign for ""jobs for Americans""; at least $35 billion, possibly more, was an arrangement between Exxon and the Indonesian state oil company Pertamina to develop an off-shore natural gas field, which could ""mean new jobs for US businesses that help set up wells and off-shore platforms,"" the Boston Globe reported. Exxon's Indonesia affiliate and Pertamina are expected to sell the liquified gas almost exclusively in Asia. GE, Hughes, Fluor Daniel, and other major corporations won contracts as well for projects in Indonesia. Another Exxon-Pertamina project is a new plant to supply Indonesia's state-owned electricity company, the London Financial Times added, noting also that U.S. taxpayers are generously helping to fund the projects by credits from the U.S. Export-Import Bank, ""part of new US `Tied-Aid' credit offers.""
All of this is sure to provide a huge flow of jobs for Americans -- at least lawyers, bankers, executives and managers, maybe a handful of skilled workers for a short period. But profits for U.S. investors? Perish the thought! The good news for U.S. workers caused a sharp increase in Exxon's stock.8
Another victory for efficient propaganda is that people wildly overestimate the percentage of the federal budget that goes to foreign aid and welfare. In fact, over half of discretionary federal spending is devoted to the military, one reason why ""the United States faces social and structural economic problems of a magnitude unknown to other economically advanced states,"" Benjamin Schwarz of the RAND corporation notes, including ""higher rates of infant mortality, illiteracy, malnutrition, and poverty than any other advanced industrialized country."" All getting worse, predictably, as the class war of the past decades intensifies in vigor and savagery. A study of the Bread for the World Institute reported a considerable decline in people suffering from hunger throughout the world in the 1980s, with only two exceptions: Africa, which registered an increase from 36% to 37%, and the United States, where the numbers increased 50% from 1985 to 1990 as ""conservative"" reforms took hold, increasing since.
The problem is most severe among children, with effects that are permanent: it is well-known that ""development of the brain is strongly influenced by the quality of the nourishment and nurturance given to infants and children,"" among other effects of ""adverse environments"" early in life that can lead ""to permanent defects in memory and learning"" (medical researchers John Frank and Fraser Mustard). But hunger among the elderly is also ""surging,"" the Wall Street Journal reports: ""several million older Americans are going hungry -- and their numbers are growing steadily,"" despite a federal law in force for 20 years ""aimed at providing free meals to anyone over 60."" Many are literally ""starving to death"" while some 5 million, about 16% of the population over 60, ""are either hungry or malnourished to some degree"" -- again, phenomena unknown in other developed societies, which lag behind us in the crusade for freedom and justice. ""The level of malnutrition and real hunger is only increasing,"" the assistant secretary for aging at the U.S. Department of Health reports.
To fully comprehend the meaning of such facts, one must bear in mind the unparalleled advantages of the United States. To select merely one indication, health and life expectancy levels of mid-18th century Americans were not achieved by the upper classes in Britain until the early 20th century -- not to speak of less privileged parts of the world. The social and economic catastrophe of American capitalism is quite an extraordinary phenomenon -- for the ""great beast,"" that is.9
Only 30% of the population are aware that military spending is the largest item on the Federal budget, and few of those know its scale or its purpose. Over a quarter think foreign aid is the biggest item. In fact, it is barely detectable. The U.S. has the most miserly record among the developed countries. The record is even worse if we exclude the parts intended to enhance U.S. control over Middle East energy reserves, ""aid"" to Israel, Egypt, and Turkey. By far the largest per capita component goes to a rich country, Israel -- artificially rich, because of the completely unparalleled flow of foreign capital including not just ""aid"" but also tax-deductible contributions that are used to maintain the sharp divisions between first- and second-class citizens, and (despite disclaimers) for the joint U.S.-Israel project of incorporating the bulk of the occupied territories within the eventual state of Israel. Eliminate that, and U.S. aid virtually vanishes -- putting aside its character and effects.
One-fifth of the population believe welfare to be the largest Federal expense. It is not too surprising, then, that the top priority for voters in 1994 was ""welfare reform"" (46%). The welfare system is ""just out of control,"" voters felt, though it pays to look more closely at actual attitudes. 44% of respondents feel that we are spending ""too much"" on welfare and 23% ""too little, economist Nancy Folbre notes, but when the phrase ""assistance to the poor"" is substituted for ""welfare"" in the same question, 13% say we are spending ""too much"" and 64% ""too little."" A reasonable speculation is that many people have absorbed Reaganite lies about ""welfare Queens"" (by insinuation, Black) driving Cadillacs, and believe that working people are supporting rich welfare recipients -- as they are, but not in the sense they imagine; we return to that.10
As already noted, the second-ranking priority for voters was health care reform (37%), though the impressive ideological warfare of the past year has left people utterly confused about what the realistic options might be. Public debate was framed within narrow bounds, the Clinton plan being the ""liberal option,"" with a few gestures to the ""radical extremists"" who thought the U.S. might consider joining the rest of the industrial world. The incomprehensible Clinton plan -- basically, a giveaway to huge insurance companies -- was rejected as just another ""big government"" proposal that would place people's fate in the hands of pointy-headed bureaucrats who steal our money by imposing a crushing tax burden; a publicly funded insurance program, to the extent it could even be considered, is still more odious in that respect.
The option preferred by the privileged is for the fate of everyone else to be in the hands of insurance company executives whose goal, as Milton Friedman can explain, is to ensure maximum profit and market share: meaning the worst possible health care; elimination of personal choice except for the rich; huge bureaucracies to micromanage physicians; public subsidy for advertising, profits, and multiple layers of high-paid managers and executives; and other massive inefficiencies that drive the U.S. off the spectrum in costs for heath care. The real meaning of the ""conservative"" option was illustrated right after the November election at the annual scientific convention of the American Heart Association, where leading specialists reported that insurers are increasingly unwilling to pay for preventive care that would reduce hospitalization rates by 75% (Dr. Lynne Stevenson of Boston's Brigham and Women's hospital). In contrast, they are quite willing to pay for heart transplants -- high tech operations that enrich the right people and institutions.
One radical extremist thought that rarely reached threshold is that in a civilized society, the costs of health care should be borne by progressive taxation, on the basis of the principle that the poor should be exempted from taxation, which should ""tax the higher portions of property in geometrical progression as they rise"" -- as observed by the noted Marxist Thomas Jefferson in a letter to his fellow-subversive James Madison. The United States is, again, off the spectrum on this aspect of human rights and needs, as measured by public share of health-care spending (which is as progressive as the tax system). The U.S. is far below any country that has achieved any form of development, even Greece and Portugal; it is barely above Turkey.11
2. ""Really existing conservatism""
The propaganda victories come into sharper focus when we compare popular perceptions with social and economic realities. Take welfare. It has sharply declined in real terms since 1970, Nancy Folbre observes, a downward spiral that is continuing, with more reductions in Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) in 1991 than in any year since 1981. From 1970, maximum AFDC benefits for a family of three with no other income fell over 40%, and the national average of AFDC benefits and food stamps combined is now at the level of AFDC alone in 1960 (before the food-stamp program was initiated).
A still more severe distortion is the unspoken premise that child care is not work: it comes free, like women's domestic labor generally -- ""the main reason why free-enterprise economies have worked relatively well over the decades,"" economist Sylvia Ann Hewlett comments. Child care therefore contrasts with Real Work: speculating in currency markets, devising tax shelters for the rich, arranging mergers and acquisitions that significantly reduce R&D and hence economic growth, and other contributions that rank high on the scale of social utility and merit according to standard dogma, which measures it by economic reward to the ""worker."" In particular, single women taking care of children are plainly not working, and therefore must be driven to the official workforce on grounds of ""economic efficiency"" (not to speak of justice), bipartisan doctrine holds. The assumptions are somewhere between nonsensical and insane, though reasonable enough within the general intellectual culture, with its tacit dedication to class warfare.
Even on the narrowest grounds, Folbre observes in the American Economic Association proceedings, ""public policy literally transfers resources from parents to nonparents by providing social insurance based on participation in paid employment without explicitly valuing time, effort, or money devoted to children,"" who are, in the longer term, the crucial factor determining ""economic health"" even in the highly distorted ideological sense of the technical notion. When real incomes in the middle quintile (about $30,000 in 1992 dollars) are adjusted for child care costs, they decline slightly through the 1970s, quite sharply from 1980 to the present as ""conservatism triumphed.""12
Responding to the ""public mood"" that has been shaped by a propaganda offensive of unusual intensity and fervor, the highest priority for the new Gingrich conservatives is to dismantle the welfare system. They announced at once that they would repeal the Food Stamp Act of 1977, the Child Nutrition Act of 1966, the National School Lunch Act of 1946, the Emergency Food Assistance Act of 1983, and other Federals laws intended to prevent hunger, particularly among children, which has not increased rapidly enough to satisfy the advocates of ""family values"" and ""free market"" verities. Furthermore, what programs remain are to be transferred to states, so as to bar any response to the typical sharp increase in need for food assistance when there is a recession, as in 1991-2, when food stamp rolls sometimes grew by 300,000 people a month. The plans will ""lead to a dramatic increase in hunger,"" Senator Patrick Leahy observed realistically; but that's nothing that has ever troubled the more loyal servants of the rich. Also on the legislative agenda -- with the support of the New Democrats -- are work obligations for mothers (who do not ""work,"" by ideological fiat) and reduction of AFDC, the main Federal Welfare program, which reaches 14.3 million people, over 9 million of them young children, who must ""learn responsibility"" and internalize our values: that there are no human rights, apart from what can be won in the labor market.
It would be unfair, however, to regard the leader, Newt Gingrich, as a heartless wretch. He proposes that the money saved from AFDC programs be used to build orphanages or ""group homes"" for children of families rendered destitute -- the state being the proper provider for children, not their mothers, under the doctrine of ""family values."" Perhaps the proposal is intended as a special contribution to the 1994 International Year of the Family. Or perhaps it is simply another useful federal subsidy, providing benefits to the construction industry, lawyers, and other people of the right sort.13
The real meaning of ""free market conservatism"" is illustrated by a closer look at the most passionate enthusiasts for ""getting the government off our backs"" and letting the market reign undisturbed. Take Newt Gingrich, the leader of the victorious congressional army who are taking over under a ""master plan"" that relied on huge contributions for Gingrich's GOPAC committee from corporate donors and others whose identity is a carefully-guarded secret. The measures are of dubious legality; GOPAC is now being sued by the Federal Elections Commission on grounds that it ""failed to register and report as a political committee."" But legal questions aside, the power play was ""a calculated political operation, unique on the contemporary American political scene"" (Ellen Miller, director of the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics), yet another blow at the despised principles of democracy and the pretensions of the ""great beast"" to meddle where it doe",en,LABEL_0,0.5187102556228638,LABEL_1,0.4812897741794586

Then bending to one side he presses a parcel against his rib and groans.)

London's burning, London's burning! On fire, on fire! (He catches sight of the navvy lurching through the crowd at the farther side of Talbot street.) I'll miss him. Run. Quick. Better cross here.

THE GONG Bang Bang Bla Bak Blud Bugg Bloo.
(The brake cracks violently. Bloom, raising a policeman's whitegloved hand, blunders stifflegged, out of the track. The motorman thrown forward, pugnosed, on the guidewheel, yells as he slides past over chains and keys.)
THE MOTORMAN Hey, shitbreeches, are you doing the hattrick?
BLOOM (Bloom trickleaps to the curbstone and halts again. He brushes a mudflake from his cheek with a parcelled hand.) No thoroughfare. Close shave that but cured the stitch. Must take up Sandow's exercises again. On the hands down. Insure against street accident too. The Providential. (He feels his trouser pocket.) Poor mamma's panacea. Heel easily catch in tracks or bootlace in a cog. Day the wheel of the black Maria peeled off my shoe at Leonard's corner. Third time is the charm. Shoe trick. Insolent driver. I ought to report him. Tension makes them nervous. Might be the fellow balked me this morning with that horsey woman. Same style of beauty. Quick of him all the same. The stiff walk. True word spoken in jest. That awful cramp in Lad lane. Something poisonous I ate. Emblem of luck. Why? Probably lost cattle. Mark of the beast. (He closes his eyes an instant.) Bit light in the head. Monthly or effect of the other. Brainfogfag. That tired feeling. Too much for me now. Ow!
(A sinister figure leans on plaited legs against O'Beirnes wall, a visage unknown, injected with dark mercury. From under a wideleaved sombrero the figure regards him with evil eye.)
BLOOM Buenos noches, se√±orita Blanca, que calle es esta?
THE FIGURE (Impassive, raises a signal arm.) Password. Sraid Mabbot.
BLOOM Haha. Merci. Esperanto. Slan leath. (He mutters.) Gaelic league spy, sent by that fireeater.
(He steps forward. A sackshouldered ragman bars his path. He steps left, ragsackman left.)
BLOOM I beg. (He swerves, sidles, stepsaside, slips past and on.)
BLOOM Keep to the right, right, right. If there is a fingerpost planted by the Touring Club at Stepaside who procured that public boon? I who lost my way and contributed to the columns of the Irish Cyclist the letter headed, In darkest Stepaside. Keep, keep, keep to the right. Rags and bones, at midnight. A fence more likely. First place murderer makes for. Wash off his sins of the world.
(Jacky Caffrey, hunted by Tommy Caffrey, runs full tilt against Bloom.)
BLOOM O!
(Shocked, on weak hams, he halts. Tommy and Jacky vanish there, there. Bloom pats with parcelled hands watch, fobpocket, bookpocket, pursepocket, sweets of sin, potato soap.)
BLOOM Beware of pickpockets. Old thieves' dodge. Collide. Then snatch your purse.
(The retriever approaches sniffling, nose to the ground. A sprawled form sneezes. A stooped bearded figure appears garbed in the long caftan of an elder in Zion and a smoking cap with magenta tassels. Horned spectacles hang down at the wings of the nose. Yellow poison streaks are on the drawn face.)
RUDOLPH Second halfcrown waste money today. I told you not go with drunken goy ever. So. You catch no money.
BLOOM (Hides the crubeen and trotter behind his back and, crestfallen, feels warm and cold feetmeat) Ja, ich weiss, papachi.
RUDOLPH What you making down this place? Have you no soul? (With feeble vulture talons he feels the silent face of Bloom) Are you not my son Leopold, the grandson of Leopold? Are you not my dear son Leopold who left the house of his father and left the god of his fathers Abraham and Jacob?
BLOOM (With precaution.) I suppose so, father. Mosenthal. All that's left of him.
RUDOLPH (Severely.) One night they bring you home drunk as dog after spend your good money. What you call them running chaps?
BLOOM (In youth's smart blue Oxford suit with white vestslips, narrowshouldered, in brown Alpine hat, wearing gent's sterling silver waterbury keyless watch and double curb Albert with seal attached, one side of him coated with stiffening mud.) Harriers, father. Only that once.
RUDOLPH Once! Mud head to foot. Cut your hand open. Lockjaw. They make you kaput, Leopoldleben. You watch them chaps.
BLOOM (Weakly.) They challenged me to a sprint. It was muddy. I slipped.
RUDOLPH (With contempt) Ooim nachez. Nice spectacles for your poor mother!
BLOOM Mamma!
ELLEN BLOOM (In pantomime dame's stringed mobcap, crinoline and bustle, widow Twankey's blouse with muttonleg sleeves buttoned behind, grey mittens and cameo brooch, her hairplaited in a crisping net, appears over the staircase banisters, a slanted candlestick in her hand and cries out in shrill alarm.) O blessed Redeemer, what have they done to him! My smelling salts! (She hauls up a reef of skirt and ransacks the pouch of her striped blay petticoat. A phial, an Agnus Dei, a shrivelled potato and a celluloid doll fall out.) Sacred Heart of Mary, where were you at all, at all?
(Bloom, mumbling, his eyes downcast, begins to bestow his parcels in his filled pockets but desists, muttering.)
A VOICE (Sharply.) Poldy!
BLOOM Who? (He ducks and wards off a blow clumsily.) At your service.
(He looks up. Beside her mirage of datepalms a handsome woman in Turkish costume stands before him. Opulent curves fill out her scarlet trousers and jacket slashed with gold. A wide yells cummerbund girdles her. A white yashmak violet in the night, covers her face, leaving free only her lace dark eyes and raven hair.)
BLOOM Molly!
MARION Welly? Mrs Marion from this out, my dear man, when you speak to me. (Satirically.) Has poor little hubby cold feet waiting so long?
BLOOM (Shifts from foot to foot.) No, no. Not the least little bit.
(He breathes in deep agitation, swallowing gulps of air questions, hopes, crubeens for her supper things to tell her excuses, desire, spellbound. A coin gleams on her forehead. On her feet are jewelled toerings. Her ankles are linked by a slender fetterchain. Beside her a camel, hooded with a turreting turban, waits. A silk ladder of innumerable rungs climbs to his bobbing howdah. He ambles near with disgruntled hindquarters. Fiercely she slaps his haunch, her goldcurb wristbangles angriling, scolding him in Moorish.)
MARION Nebrakada! Feminimum.
(The camel, lifting a foreleg, plucks from a tree a lace mango fruit, offers it to his mistress, blinking, in his cloven hoof then droops his head and, grunting, with uplifted neck, fumbles to kneel. Bloom stoops his back for leapfrog.)
BLOOM I can give you... I mean as your business menagerer Mrs Marion... if you...
MARION So you notice some change? (Her hands passing slowly over her trinketed stomacher. A slow friendly mockery in her eyes.) O Poldy, Poldy, you are a poor old stick in the mud! Go and see life. See the wide world.
BLOOM I was just going back for that lotion whitewax, orangeflower water. Shop closes early on Thursday. But the first thing in the morning. (He pats divers pockets.) This moving kidney. Ah!
(He points to the south, then to the east. A cake of new clean lemon soap arises, diffusing light and perfume.)
THE SOAP
We're a capital couple are Bloom and I;
He brightens the earth, I polish the sky.

(The freckled face of Sweny, the druggist, appears in the disc of the soapsun.)
SWENY Three and a penny, please.
BLOOM Yes. For my wife, Mrs Marion. Special recipe.
MARION (Softly.) Poldy!
BLOOM Yes, ma'am?
MARION Ti trema un poco il cuore?
(In disdain she saunters away, plump as a pampered pouter pigeon, humming the duet from Don Giovanni)
BLOOM Are you sure about that Voglio? I mean the pronunciati...
(He follows, followed by the sniffing terrier. The elderly bawd seizes his sleeve, the bristles of her chinmole glittering.)
THE BAWD Ten shillings a maidenhead. Fresh thing was never touched. Fifteen. There's no-one in it only her old father that's dead drunk.
(She points. In the gap of her dark den furtive, rainbedraggled Bridie Kelly stands.)
BRIDIE Hatch street. Any good in your mind?
(With a squeak she flaps her bat shawl and runs. A burly rough pursues with booted strides. He stumbles on the steps, recovers, plunges into gloom. Weak squeaks of laughter are heard, weaker.)
THE BAWD (Her wolfeyes shining.) He's getting his pleasure. You won't get a virgin in the flash houses. Ten shillings. Don't be all night before the polis in plain clothes sees us. Sixtyseven is a bitch.
(Leering Gerty MacDowell limps forward. She draws from behind ogling, and shows coyly her bloodied clout.)
GERTY With all my worldly goods I thee and thou. (She murmurs.) You did that. I hate you.
BLOOM I? When? You're dreaming. I never saw you.
THE BAWD Leave the gentleman alone, you cheat. Writing the gentleman false letters. Streetwalking and soliciting. Better for your mother take the strap to you at the bedpost, hussy like you.
GERTY (To Bloom.) When you saw all the secrets of my bottom drawer. (She paws his sleeve, slobbering.) Dirty married man! I love you for doing that to me.
(She slides away crookedly. Mrs Breen in man's frieze overcoat with loose bellows pockets, stands in the causeway, her roguish eyes wideopen, smiling in all her herbivorous buckteeth.)
MRS BREEN Mr.
BLOOM (Coughs gravely.) Madam, when we last had this pleasure by letter dated the sixteenth instant .
MRS BREEN Mr Bloom! You down here in the haunts of sin! I caught you nicely! Scamp!
BLOOM (Hurriedly.) Not so loud my name. Whatever do you think me? Don't give me away. Walls have hears. How do you do? It's ages since I. You're looking splendid. Absolutely it. Seasonable weather we are having this time of year. Black refracts heat. Short cut home here. Interesting quarter. Rescue of fallen women Magdalen asylum. I am the secretary...
MRS BREEN (Holds up a finger.) Now don't tell a big fib! I know somebody won't like that. O just wait till I see Molly! (Slily.) Account for yourself this very minute or woe betide you!
BLOOM (Looks behind.) She often said she'd like to visit. Slumming. The exotic, you see. Negro servants too in livery if she had money. Othello black brute. Eugene Stratton. Even the bones and cornerman at the Livermore christies. Bohee brothers. Sweep for that matter.
(Tom and Sam Bohee, coloured coons in white duck suits, scarlet socks, upstarched Sambo chokers and lace scarlet asters in their buttonholes leap out. Each has his banjo slung. Their paler smaller negroid hands jingle the twingtwang wires. Flashing white Kaffir eyes and tusks they rattle through a breakdown in clumsy clogs, twinging, singing, back to back, toe heel, heel toe, with smackfatclacking nigger lips.)
There's someone in the house with Dina
There's someone in the house, I know,
There's someone in the house with Dina
Playing on the old banjo.

(They whisk black masks from raw babby faces: then, chuckling, chortling, trumming, twanging they diddle diddle cakewalk dance away.)
BLOOM (With a sour tenderish smile.) A little frivol, shall we, if you are so inclined? Would you like me perhaps to embrace you just for a fraction of a second?
MRS BREEN (Screams gaily.) O, you ruck! You ought to see yourself!
BLOOM For old sake'sake. I only meant a square party, a mixed marriage mingling of our different little conjugials. You know I had a soft corner for you. (Gloomily.) 'Twas I sent you that valentine of the dear gazelle.
MRS BREEN Glory Alice, you do look a holy show! Killing simply. (She puts out her hand inquisitively.) What are you hiding behind your back? Tell us, there's a dear.
BLOOM (Seizes her wrist with his free hand.) Josie Powell that was, prettiest deb in Dublin. How time flies by! Do you remember, harking back in a retrospective arrangement, Old Christmas night Georgina Simpson's housewarming while they were playing the Irving Bishop game, finding the pin blindfold and thoughtreading? Subject, what is in this snuff box?
MRS BREEN You were the lion of the night with your seriocomic recitation and you looked the part. You were always a favourite with the ladies.
BLOOM (Squire of dames, in dinner jacket, with watered-silk facings, blue masonic badge in his buttonhole, black bow and mother-of-pearl studs, a prismatic champagne glass tilted in his hand.) Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Ireland, home and beauty.
MRS BREEN The dear dead days beyond recall. Love's old sweet song.
BLOOM (Meaningfully dropping his voice.) I confess I'm teapot with curiosity to find out whether some person's something is a little teapot at present.
MRS BREEN (Gushingly.) Tremendously teapot! London's tea pot and I'm simply teapot all over me. (She rubs sides with him.) After the parlour mystery games and the crackers from the tree we sat on the staircase ottoman. Under the mistletoe. Two is company.
BLOOM (Wearing a purple Napoleon hat with an amber halfmoon, his fingers and thumbs passing slowly down to her soft moist meaty palm which she surrenders gently.) The witching hour of night. I took the splinter out of this hand, carefully, slowly. (Tenderly, as he slips on her finger a ruby ring.) L√† ci darem la mano.
MRS BREEN (In a onepiece eveningfrock executed in moonlight blue, a tinsel sylph's diadem on her brow with her dancecard fallen beside her moonblue satin slipper curves her palm softly, breathing quickly.) Voglio e non. You're hot! You're scalding! The left hand nearest the heart.
BLOOM When you made your present choice they said it was beauty and the beast. I can never forgive you for that. (His clenched fist at his brow.) Think what it means. All you meant to me then. (Hoarsely.) Woman, it's breaking me! (Dennis Breen, whitetallhatted, with Wisdom Hely's sandwich board, shuffles past them in cadet slippers, his dull beard thrust out, muttering to right and left. Little Alf Bergan, cloaked in the pall of the ace of spaces, dogs him to left and right, doubled in laughter.)
ALF BERGAN (Points jeering at the sandwich boards.) U.p.: Up.
MRS BREEN (To Bloom.) High jinks below stairs. (She gives him the glad eye.) Why didn't you kiss the spot to make it well? You wanted to.
BLOOM (Shocked.) Molly's best friend! Could you?
MRS BREEN (Her pulpy tongue between her lips, offers a pigeon kiss.) Hnhn. The answer is a lemon. Have you a little present for me there?
BLOOM (Off handedly.) Kosher. A snack for supper. The home without potted meat is incomplete. I was at Leah. Mrs Bandman Palmer. Trenchant exponent of Shakespeare. Unfortunately threw away the programme. Rattling good place round there for pig's feet. Feel.
(Richie Goulding, three ladies' hats pinned on his head, appears weighted to one side by the black legal bag of Collis and Ward on which a skull and crossbones are painted in white limewash. He ins it and shows it full of polonies, kippered, herrings, Findon haddies and tightpacked pills.)
RICHIE Best value in Dub.
(Bald Pat, bothered beetle, stands on the curbstone, folding his napkin, waiting to wait.)
PAT (Advances with a tilted dish of spillspilling gravy.) Steak and kidney. Bottle of lager. Hee hee hee. Wait till I wait.
RICHIE Goodgod. Inev erate inall...
(With hanging head he marches doggedly forward. The navvy, lurching by, gores him with his flaming pronghorn.)
RICHIE (With a cry of pain, his hand to his back) Ah! Bright's! Lights!
BLOOM (Points to the navvy.) A spy. Don't attract attention. I hate stupid crowds. I am not on pleasure bent. I am in a grave predicament.
MRS BREEN Humbugging and delutbering as per usual with your cock and bull story.
BLOOM I want to tell you a little secret about how I came to be here. But you must never tell. Not even Molly. I have a most particular reason.
MRS BREEN (All agog.) O, not for worlds.
BLOOM Let's walk on. Shall us?
MRS BREEN Let's.
(The bawd makes an unheeded sign. Bloom walks on with Mrs Breen. The terrier follows, whining piteously, wagging his tail.)
THE BAWD Jewman's melt!
BLOOM (In an oatmeal sporting suit, a sprig of woodbine in the lapel, tony buff shirt, shepherd's plaid Saint Andrew's cross scarftie, white spats, fawn dustcoat on his arm, tawny red brogues, fieldglasses in bandolier and a grey billycock hat.) Do you remember a long long time, years and years ago, just after Milly, Marionette we called her, was weaned when we all went together to Fairyhouse races, was it?
MRS BREEN (In smart Saxe tailormade, white velours hat and spider veil.) Leopardstown.
BLOOM I mean, Leopardstown. And Molly won seven shillings on a three year old named Nevertell and coming home along by Foxrock in that old fiveseater shanderadan of a waggonette you were in your heyday then and you had on that new hat of white velours with a surround of molefur that Mrs Hayes advised you to buy because it was marked down to nineteen and eleven, a bit of wire and an old rag of velveteen, and I'll lay you what you like she did it on purpose...
MRS BREEN She did, of course, the cat! Don't tell me! Nice adviser!
BLOOM Because it didn't suit you one quarter as well as the other ducky little tammy toque with the bird of paradise wing in it that I admired on you and you honestly looked just too fetching in it though it was a pity to kill it, you cruel creature, little mite of a thing with a heart the size of a fullstop.
MRS BREEN (Squeezes his arm, simpers.) Naughty cruel I was.
BLOOM (Low, secretly, ever more rapidly.) And Molly was eating a sandwich of spiced beef out of Mrs Joe Gallaher's lunch basket. Frankly, though she had her advisers or admirers, I never cared much for her style. She was .
MRS BREEN Too.
BLOOM Yes. And Molly was laughing because Rogers and Maggot O'Reilly were mimicking a cock as we passed a farmhouse and Marcus Tertius Moses, the tea merchant, drove past us in a gig with his daughter, Dancer Moses was her name, and the poodle in her lap bridled up and you asked me if I ever heard or read or knew or came across .
MRS BREEN (Eagerly.) Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
(She fades from his side. Followed by the whining dog he walks on towards hellsgates. In an archway a standing woman, bent forward, her feet apart, pisses cowily. Outside a shuttered pub a bunch of loiterers listen to a tale which their broken snouted gaffer rasps out with raucous humour. An armless pair of them flop wrestling, growling, in maimed sodden playfight.)
THE GAFFER (Crouches, his voice twisted in his snout.) And when Cairns came down from the scaffolding in Beaver Street what was he after doing it into only into the bucket of porter that was there waiting on the shavings for Derwan's plasterers.
THE LOITERERS (Guffaw with cleft palates.) O jays!
(Their paintspeckled hats wag. Spattered with size and lime of their lodges they frisk limblessly about him.)
BLOOM Coincidence too. They think it funny. Anything but that. Broad daylight. Trying to walk. Lucky no woman.
THE LOITERERS Jays, that's a good one. Glauber salts. O jays, into the men's porter.
(Bloom passes. Cheap whores, singly, coupled, shawled, dishevelled, call from lanes, doors, corners.)
THE WHORES Are you going far, queer fellow? How's your middle leg? Got a match on you? Eh, come here till I stiffen it for you.
(He plodges through their sump towards the lighted street beyond. From a bulge of window curtains a gramophone rears a battered brazen trunk. In the shadow a shebeenkeeper haggles with the navvy and the two redcoats.)
THE NAVVY (Belching.) Where's the bloody house?
THE SHEBEENKEEPER Purdon street. Shilling a bottle of stout. Respectable woman.
THE NAVVY (Gripping the two redcoats, staggers forward with them.) Come on, you British army!
PRIVATE CARR (Behind his back.) He aint half balmy.
PRIVATE COMPTON (LAughs.) What ho!
PRIVATE CARR (To the navvy.) Portobello barracks canteen. You ask for Carr. Just Carr.
THE NAVVY (Shouts.)
We are the boys. Of Wexford.
PRIVATE COMPTON Say! What price the sergeantmajor?
PRIVATE CARR Bennett? He's my pal. I love old Bennett.
THENAVVY (Shouts.)
The galling chain.
And free our native land.

(He staggers forward, dragging them with him. Bloom stops, at fault. The dog approaches, his tongue outlolling, panting.)
BLOOM Wildgoose chase this. Disorderly houses. Lord knows where they are gone. Drunks cover distance double quick. Nice mixup. Scene at Westland row. Then jump in first class with third ticket. Then too far. Train with engine behind. Might have taken me to Malahide or a siding for the night or collision. Second drink does it. Once is a dose. What am I following him for? Still, he's the best of that lot. If I hadn't heard about Mrs Beaufoy Purefoy I wouldn't have gone and wouldn't have met. Kismet. He'll lose that cash. Relieving office here. Good biz for cheapjacks, organs. What do ye lack? Soon got, soon gone. Might have lost my life too with that mangongwheeltracktrolleyglarejuggernaut only for presence of mind. Can't always save you, though. If I had passed Truelock's window that day two minutes later would have been shot. Absence of body. Still if bullet only went through my coat get damages for shock, five hundred pounds. What was he? Kildare street club toff. God help his gamekeeper.
(He gazes ahead reading on the wall a scrawled chalk legend Wet Dream and a phallic design.)
Odd! Molly drawing on the frosted carriagepane at Kingstown. What's that like? (Gaudy dollwomen loll in the lighted doorways, in window embrasures, smoking birdseye cigarettes. The odour of the sicksweet weed floats towards him in slow round ovalling wreaths.)
THE WREATHS Sweet are the sweets. Sweets of sin.
BLOOM My spine's a bit limp. Go or turn? And this food? Eat it and get all pigsticky. Absurd I am. Waste of money. One and eightpence too much. (The retriever drives a cold snivelling muzzle against his hand, wagging his tail.) Strange how they take to me. Even that brute today. Better speak to him first. Like women they like rencontres. Stinks like a polecat. Chacun son go√ªt. He might be mad. Fido. Uncertain in his movements. Good fellow! Garryowen! (The wolfdog sprawls on his back, wriggling obscenely with begging paws, his long black tongue lolling out.) Influence of his surroundings. Give and have done with it. Provided nobody. (Calling encouraging words he shambles back with a furtive poacher's tread, dogged by the setter into a dark stalestunk corner. He unrolls one parcel and goes to dump the crubeen softly but holds back and feels the trotter.) Sizeable for threepence. But then I have it in my left hand. Calls for more effort. Why? Smaller from want of use. O, let it slide. Two and six.
(With regret he lets unrolled crubeen and trotter slide. The mastiff mauls the bundle clumsily and gluts himself with growling greed, crunching the bones. Two raincaped watch approach, silent, vigilant. They murmur together.)
THE WATCH Bloom. Of Bloom. For Bloom. Bloom.
(Each lays a hand on Blooms shoulder.)
FIRST WATCH Caught in the act. Commit no nuisance.
BLOOM (Stammers.) I am doing good to others.
(A covey of gulls, storm petrels, rises hungrily from Liffey slime with Banbury cakes in their beaks.)
THE GULLS Kaw kave kankury kake.
BLOOM The friend of man. Trained by kindness.
(He points. Bob Doran, toppling from a high bars tool, sways over the munching spaniel.)
BOB DORAN Towser. Give us the paw. Give the paw.
(The bulldog growls, his scruff standing, a gobbet of pigs knuckle between his molars through which rabid scrumspittle dribbles. Bob Doran falls silently into an area.)
SECOND WATCH Prevention of cruelty to animals.
BLOOM (Enthusiastically.) A noble work! I scolded that tramdriver on Harold's cross bridge for illusing the poor horse with his harness scab. Bad French I got for my pains. Of course it was frosty and the last tram. All tales of circus life are highly demoralising.
(Signor Maffei, passion pale, in liontamer's costume with diamond studs in his shirtfront, steps forward, holding a circus paper hoop, a curling carriagewhip and a revolver with which he covers the going boarhound.)
SIGNOR MAFFEI (With a sinister smile.) Ladies and gentlemen, my educated greyhound. It was I broke in the bucking broncho Ajax with my patent spiked saddle for carnivores. Lash under the belly with a knotted thong. Block tackle and a strangling pully will bring your lion to heel, no matter how fractious, even Leo ferox there, the Libyan maneater. A redhot crowbar and some liniment rubbing on the burning part produced Fritz of Amsterdam, the thinking hyena. (He glares.) I possess the Indian sign. The glint of my eye does it with these breastsparklers. (With a bewitching smile.) I now introduce Mademoiselle Ruby, the pride of the ring.
FIRST WATCH Come. Name and address.

Well, you know, I got to say, I don't think any of us knew what to expect this weekend, but this has been the best weekend of my life. Thank you. Thank you.
Also, I know all the Hall of Famers, they've been keeping timers on everybody. And they're like, ""It's really getting late, past our bedtimes""; I'm a morning guy it's past mine, too. But I promise I'm going to get you out of here before, instead they consider us the 2014 class, they will consider us the 2015 class. We've been out here a long time; we're going to get out of here.
You know, I just-- you got to thank the Hall of Fame. You got to thank the trustees.
I got to thank my classmates. I mean, Derrick, Walter, Aeneas, Claude, Ray; just absolutely amazing. I'm honored to be in the class with you guys. You epitomize class, and I think this is where I belong. I'm so happy to be here with you guys.
And, to my friend Jay Glazer To my friend, Jay Glazer, who I've known for 21 years. You know me better than anybody.  You've treated me better than anybody at times and worse than anybody at times.  And that's why I love you and that's why you're here, because you know the way I played the game. You know why I played the game, and there is nobody better here to present me than you.  So I love you, and thank you Mr. Glazer.
I know my life now is like teleprompters and scripts and all that stuff.  I just wrote some things.  This is from the heart.  This is not TV Michael.  This is football Michael.  This is what you saw on that screen.  Life is about lessons.  My life is improbable.  I am an absolutely improbable Hall of Famer.  I am an improbable football player because I didn't grow up saying, I'm going to do this.
You know, you've certain moments in your life that change your life.  I'm going to go to when I was 13 years old.  I'm the youngest of six.  I've got my sister Sandra here, my sister Debra, my brothers Gene, Sr., Junoir, my brother Chris, my brother Victor.  I'm the youngest of six.  I'm the one that gets beat up.  I'm the one that gets abused.  I was 13 years old, and I'm going to say I was a husky kid.  I called it big boned.  I was big boned.  I was husky, big boned, and they made fun of me.  Bob, right?  You know about Bob, right?  Well everybody here doesn't know about Bob, but I'm going to talk about Bob, because it still hurts me to talk about it, but I'll talk about it because you know it.  My brothers call me Bob, and Bob meant ""Booty on Back.""  They said, you know, everybody gets their wallet like that, you just grab yours like that.  So I was a husky kid.
But at 13 years old I realized this, for the first time this is when I can take something and I can own it.  I can change the course of action in my life if there is something I don't like, I can change it.  So as every 13 year old kid in Mannheim, Germany does or every 13 year old kid who wants to get in shape, I went out and got some Jane Fonda tapes.  Oh, I ain't lying, Marcus Allen.  I got Jane Fonda tapes, and I was high kicking and side kicking.  I was doing it all.
Then I graduated.  I graduated to the Herschel Walker workout book, push ups and sit ups.  My dad saw this.  And my father    Dad, I don't even know what to say about you, because he's the most amazing, amazing man.  Retired major for the U.S. Army, 82nd airborne division master paratrooper, and more so than any of that, one hell of a father because, Dad    my dad saw me doing that.  My dad said, ‚ÄúYou know what?  Let's work out.‚Äù  He start working out with me.  We'd go to the gym.  We'd do everything.  He would read his magazines and he would come up with these programs.  He didn't know anything about it.  He was a boxer.  He didn't know about the weightlifting part, but muscle and fitness, whatever it was that he took these programs out I can't read one to this day because of that.
I remember being in the gym, and I didn't want to be there. And my dad looked at me and said, ‚ÄúSon, one day it will pay off.‚Äù  And, dad, I got to say it paid off.  It really did.  Even when he said that I didn't know what he meant, because I was trying to work off Bob.  I wasn't trying to be a football player.  I'm in Germany.  It's the last thing.  It's improbable that I am going to be a football player of any type.  And my dad would take me to the gym and beat me down.  Take me to the woods and make me run every morning in the summer 5:30 I'm running in the woods when other kids are sleeping.
Then I'd come home to the sweetest mama that you could ever ask for, Louise Strahan.  Mama, you know your baby love you.  I love every time, even at 42 years old I come home and you cook my favorite cookies and my favorite cake and every meal that I love.  There is nothing like a mother's love, and I'm not ashamed to say that I'm a mama's boy.
So, all these years I was out with my dad.  Bob has slimmed up.  I'm feeling good about myself.  My dad said, ‚ÄúYou know what?  You're going to Houston.  You're going to play football.  You're going to stay with your uncle Arthur.  He played seven years in the NFL.  You're going to get a scholarship.‚Äù  I was naive.  Okay.  I'll hop on a plane, go to Houston, stay with my uncle Arthur who was 7 years in the NFL.
Uncle Ray used to take me in the front yard and beat me down to try to teach me the game of football.  I had no idea what I was doing.  But the improbable happened.
I got a scholarship to Texas Southern University.  Now at TSU, I played under Coach Walter Highsmith, Coach J.W. Harper, Coach Conway Hayman, and Coach C.L. Whittington, and I'm not going to go too deep into all these things right now, but I just want to say it was perfect for me.  I didn't get swallowed up.  I had coaches who cared about me and who loved me.
The thing that I learned the most about Texas Southern is I had to grow up.  I could be a mama's boy, but I had to be a mama's boy when I'm at home with my mama, and they taught me that.  They taught me at the perfect moment because I ended up going to the scariest city that I could ever imagine, New York City.  And I went there because the improbable happened again.  I get drafted by the New York freaking Giants.  Yeah, baby.  The football Giants.
And not only, not only by the Giants, but I get drafted by Wellington Mara, okay?  The Duke.  Now, for all of you young kids who may not know about Wellington Mara, whenever you get a football, a real serious NFL football, you look on it, and it says The Duke.  That man drafted me.  Bob Tisch, the Tisch family, and the great and late George Young, those are the guys who brought me and trusted me enough to bring me to the Giants.  With the Tisch family, Mr. Tisch, as a rookie I hurt my foot.  I'm doing the sack dance against Cincinnati and hurt my foot.  Yeah, I'm finally admitting it.  I never admit it.  I always said I hurt it on the play.  But it was during the sack dance.  Get it out.  Every day to go from the field to the Field House, or the Field House to the field for practice, and I was on crutches.  It was a long way.  After about two weeks of this, a car pulls up.  Door opens and guy tells me to get in, Bob Tisch.
And every day until I was off those crutches he drove me to and from practice.  I was a rookie who had done nothing for this man's team, and that developed a friendship with him that lasted until he passed away.  So in the spirit of that, his kids, John Mara and Steve Tisch have continued in that spirit of realizing that the team is a family.  It's not about this or that.  It's about a team.  It's about all of us being one.  It's about all of us understanding that we're all in this together.  There is no ownership.  It's all on one level.
It made me the best because I realized even after they were no longer with us, they were always watching me.  I want to say to the Tisch family and the Mirra family, and John and Steve, all those times you told me how proud your fathers were of me, how proud they would be of me, how much they loved me, it didn't go in one ear and out the other.  It meant the world to me, and I am so honored to represent the G man family up here today.
Now, I was crazy enough to play 15 years and fortunate enough to play 15 years.  Over those 15 years I played over, I feel like three generations of players.  The first generation, Ernie Accorsi, George Young, Dan Reeves, Mike Nolan, and Earl Leggett.  Dan Reeves, the head coach, Mike Nolan was the defensive coordinator, Earl Leggett was my defensive line coach.  Earl Leggett was the kind of coach you had, but you wish you had.  He would work you so much if you had him, that you wish you were gone so you could say, I had him.  He worked you.  He said, I'm going to test your bloodline.  I'm going to test what your mama's made of, your grandmama, your great grandmama, your pappy, and everybody else that's going to come after you, son, and he did it.
But he also did that to the great Howie Long.  So I had a role model.  I had somebody I looked at and said that's who I can be.  Earl taught you in football there are no finesse players at least where I came from.  I watch the tape and I'm running into guys, and I was not a big guy.  But one thing that Earl put inside of me and into my head from the beginning, in football, son, you can be finesse all you want, but eventually, you're going to have to hit somebody.  For that, I'll never forget, and that's the way I lived my entire career.  So I want to thank Earl.
I want to thank his wife, Bobbi, for letting us have Earl at the time we had him when he was here with us.  Earl, rest in peace.  I know you are proud and I know you are looking down on me right now.
Phil Simms is in the locker room.  I'm like, man, I started when I was six years old.  They still here?  But I learned something.  Life lessons, I learned lessons in a lot of ways.  Phil Simms I learned.  First one in, last one to leave.  Nothing's easy.  You've got to work for it.  O.J. Anderson, I learned.  O.J. Anderson and Michael Brooks, I know he's at home and struggling with health issues.
Michael, you helped me more than I could ever repay you, my friend.  You took me under your wing with O.J. Anderson as a rookie, it showed no matter what year you are in the league, you're a great player.  You play against them and you make your own judgment.  From the first lessons I was told by these guys, I thank them for taking me under their wings.  Then there was LT.  My man to the left.  When I was a rookie, I was scared of you.  Now I'm retired and I'm up here with you with this yellow jacket, I'm still scared of you.
But one thing I can say about Lawrence Taylor is everyone knows he's a great football player, and everyone knows he's a great athlete because he watched the games.  But if you watched the practices, you'd understand why.  Take a scout team play, running 100 miles per hour every single play he's on that field, that's how I learned how a real pro practices.  That's what I learned from you, Lawrence.  But I also learned that it's okay to sleep in meetings sometimes.  Even though you did it all the time.  Thank you.  There you go.
Then I had the next generation.  I had my coach, Jim Fassel.  I know you're here.  I had my defensive coordinators, John Fox.  John Fox, I know you're here, my man.  You changed up your entire schedule with the Denver Broncos to be here for me tonight, and I'll never forget it.  I appreciate you, thank you.  Then I had Denny Marshall, my defensive line coach who is here somewhere as well.
One thing I learned under these guys, you can be tough.  You can run through these guys and be physical, but you can have fun doing it.  And fun we had.  We had a lot of fun.  In this era, this is where I felt like it became my team.  This is the guy, LT had retired.  All these guys that I came with and learned under had retired.  It became my team.  It was my team with Amani Toomer, Tiki Barber, Gary Jones, Robert Harris, Jason Sehorn, and we went to the Super Bowl.  This was a Super Bowl team.  Had the one and only Keith Hamilton, Hammer.
And last but not least, we had my man, the one guy that came in with me in my draft class, Mr. Jesse Armstead.  Jesse and I used to stand in the tunnel before every game and    there you go, J.  I see you on that big screen, man.  Thank you for being here for me.  And Jesse would stand in the tunnel with a me and we'd look at each other and we'd say, ""You and me,"" because we knew we had to be the leaders out there for this team.  A lot of guys have to go into games and do that alone.  All I've got to say is I never had to because I had Jesse Armstead by me, so, Jesse, I appreciate you, thank you.
Then we move on to the last generation.  In this generation, I'm the old guy.  In football terms, I was old.  But I've got to say these are the guys that brought me the Super Bowl these are the guys that brought me the Super Bowl right here.
It was the generation of head coach Tom Coughlin who is here.  There you go.  Defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo, and my defensive line coach, Mike Brothel.  And I think it's no secret that Tom Coughlin and I did not see eye to eye when he came to New York, but we finally realized we both had the same goal, and that was to win.  It wasn't about ego.  I want to say he taught me so many things about responsibility, accountability, how to be a better teammate, even though I thought I was a good teammate, but how to be a man, about how to be five minutes early to a meeting when the meeting starts at 8.  Just tell me 7:55; don't tell me it starts at 8:00.  That one I still don't get.  I ain't going to lie to you.  But you made me a better man, Coach Coughlin.  You gave me a lesson that transcends anything, that I'll carry with me well past my football career, and carry with me every day that I go forward now.  I love you and I thank you.  Thank you for trusting me to be a leader on your football team.
I have to throw out some offensive guys out there.  Sean O'Hara, Brandon Jacob, Derrick Ward, David Diehl, Chris Snee, Plaxico Burris, David Tyree and his helmet.  Yes, his helmet.  And last but not least, Eli Manning.  My man, Eli.  Look at him.  He don't get excited for nothing.  He's cracking a smile.  That is the most I've seen in about ten years.  Now I used to go in the locker room before every game, and I would go and tap and touch, and high five, and pep talk every player, equipment guy, Coach.  The reason I did it because each time I touch each guy I'm accountable to you.  What I put out on that field today is not for me, it's for you.  You will never be disappointed in me.  That's why I did it.  I would give guys the pep talk.  You got to run big today, baby.  You got to bring it, yeah.  Then I'd see Eli just sitting in his locker just like he's sitting over there in that seat.  Yep.  There you go.  Whew.
I used to sit there and say, how am I going to reach this boy?  How am I going to reach this boy?  And I realized I didn't have to.  He was already reached.  So when I went to Eli, instead of all of that I would go yeah to    I'd shake his hand and smile and say have fun, young man.  Have fun.  And with you Eli, I learned.  You don't have to be outwardly excited to be internally combustible to go out there and whip some people on the football field, my friend, and you have done it.  You are the perfect demeanor for New York City, I will tell you that.
Now when it came to the defensive side of the ball, we had a few guys that Osi Umenyiora, Justin Tuck, Fred Robbins, David Tollefson, Kiwi (Mathias Kiwanuka), my ace, Antonio Pierce who is here right now, AP, and who would have thought that the last game that I played was going to be with these guys, and it was going to be to hoist the Lombardi Trophy.  The last game I was out there as a New York Giant.  Before we had the opportunity to do that, it was improbable that was going to happen.  It was improbable.
I'm getting ready for the game.  During the week we're getting ready, and everybody's excited and I'm telling the guys calm down.  I've been in the Super Bowl and we lost, okay?  Just relax.  Have a good time.  Enjoy yourself, but stay focused.  Well, the guys take it a little too much to heart.  They're having too good of a time.  But I couldn't tell them to pull it back because I told them to have a good time.  So I'm nervous.  We get into breakfast and morning of the Super Bowl.  I put some eggs on my plate.  And Osi comes up to me and he goes, Michael, if we don't get to Tom Brady today, we ain't going to win this game.  And I looked at him and said, what you learn how to read the paper?  That's what    tell me something I didn't know.  He said, then he looked at me again as I went to get some    he grabbed me.
He said, no, if we don't get to Tom Brady today, we're not going to win this game.  Now, well, again, it was improbable.  It was improbable.  We couldn't beat an 18 0 team.  We barely made it to the playoffs.  It was improbable, but it was not impossible.  So, not only did we win, we stomped them out.  So, life is about improbability.  I want to thank a lot of my teammates I didn't get a chance to name and a lot of coaches and a lot of the trainers and doctors and everybody because it is truly something that is a team sport.
I'm so glad that I was able to be    they were able to be part of my football life and my football journey.  And I hope it was great for them for me to be a part of theirs.  Because anybody who thinks we‚Äôre up here because of ourselves, we're fooling ourselves.  This is about a family.  This is about teammates, this is about everybody pitching in to make you better, and for you hopefully to make them better.  There are a lot of friends out there I've learned from.  A lot of times you get up here and you thank your teammates and that's all you learn from it.  That's not the truth.  I've learned from a lot of guys up here.  I was a late bloomer as a football player.  I didn't play in high school.  I played one year in high school.  I was a late bloomer.
So I had to watch and learn from guys.  There is one legend here with us right now who I learned so much from, and that is Howie Long.  And Howie, I've got to tell you, I've watched some film of you from Earl that if you put you and every D line man up here on stage and bent over I could look at your butt and say, that's Howie Long, because I've seen it so much, man.  I learned so much from you, Howie, and I'm indebted to you, looking at you every week and think of you as my brother.  The other brother who was here and I met as a rookie and he took me under his wing, and I wish he was still here with us is the one and only, the original sack master, Mr. Deacon Jones, I've got to say, Deacon, I love you, my friend.  I love you, thank you.      And there are so many guys that are up here that I want to acknowledge because I am not me without you.  I looked at your style and I took from you.  I had to learn from being visual.  The late Reggie White was someone I had to learn from.  John Randle.  John Randle.  I read a story about you in the grocery store doing pass rush moves on shopping carts.  I would do that.
Chris Doleman, stole from you.  Bruce Smith, Bruce you made me ride a StairMaster until I couldn't ride them anymore.  And Bruce, I learned, man.  As I got older, lose weight, prolong your career.  You taught me so much.  I loved watching each and every one of you guys, and I am a mixture of all of you.
So as I stand up here, it's not Michael Strahan.  It's you guys.  You guys are right here.  You guys are me, and I truly am you.  So I am indebted to you guys, and thank you.
You've got to thank some of your opponents that make you better.  I'm going to be honest.  There are two guys that made me better.  One was the meanest guy I've ever played against in my life.  I don't think the guy even liked his mama.  And that was Erik Williams of the Dallas Cowboys.  And Erik, I hope you're watching because he taught me this.  We're in a game.  We're losing.  I'm mad, and I can't wait for the next game against Erik Williams and the Cowboys.  Actually, I could because I was a little scared of him, but I was just upset.  So I was saying, Erik, when we get back next game, I'm going to do this.  I'm going to do that.  I'm going to do this.  He calmly looked me in the face and he said, you know what?  Sometimes you just got to learn to take a butt whooping like a man.  And I learned.  I didn't want to take many more butt whippings so I better get better.  So Erik, I thank you for that.
The other, may surprise a lot of people, is Jon Runyan, Philadelphia Eagles.  And Jon, I know you're here, Congressman Runyan.  I know you flew in to support me.  There you go, big guy.  Why don't you stand up so they can see you.  6'9"", 350 pounds of twisted steel and non sex appeal.
Jon, you made me a student of the game.  I'm going to talk directly to you when you went from the Eagles to Tennessee, it made me mad.  I felt like they brought you to stop me.  And it really, really bothered me.  You made me learn to be a student to study my opponent.  To learn my opponent better than they knew themselves.  Even though everybody thinks that I had so many battles against you and I was winning and everything    well, I was    but you won quite a bit of battles, man.
You were the toughest guy that I've ever had to face on a consistent basis, and you made me a much better football player.  After watching these films and you don't play anymore, your right foot gave away everything you were going to do.  But I love you Jon Runyan.
Now, it's so funny.  Now a lot of people who are probably here watching this show and probably here in person, a lot of them, especially the younger generation probably don't even realize I actually played football.  I don't look at it as a slight, I look at it as a compliment.  I think it actually complements the game of football because it just goes to show what football can do for you.  What football can do for anybody, and for what the game of football has done for me, I am eternally grateful to this game.  I am eternally grateful to this game.  As I say, it's all so improbable.
I've got to say some thanks out there.  It's hard not to throw thanks out to my FOX family, Howie, Jimmy (Johnson), Curt (Menefee), Jay Glazer, and the guys at FOX.  To my ABC family, I want to thank them for coming out to support me.  My TV wife, Kelly Ripa, thank you, baby.  Everybody has been like where's Kelly?  Where's Kelly?  Well, there she is, people.  She's here.  And to the one and only Robin Roberts.  Robin, thank you for coming out here to support me.  I appreciate you.  I love you.
Over the years, since I moved to New York, my family was in Germany when I was in New York, so I didn't have a lot of    my parents weren't there.  I had to meet new friends who all had become my family.  So really quickly I want to say my friend Gene Wolfson, without you, my friend, I don't know where I'd be.  So I've got to say Gene Wolfson, my friend Ian Smith, his brother Dana, thank you, guys.  The Hockfelders, Kenneth and Maria, the Sanders family, Harvey, you've been so good to me.  The Randles, the Coopers, the Ravens, my girl, Tracy Perlman.  Of course my fat smack family is Jose and especially Constance Schwartz who is my sister and my partner in crime, and who keeps me on the straight and narrow.
Constance, I love you.  You are like everything to me, and I always    I'm your brother.  I'm your brother from another mother.  I don't need that page anymore.  I'm done with it.
I've got to thank my agent, Tony Agnone for doing right by me.  I appreciate you, Tony.
Last but -- mostly -- we're very fortunate to play this game and very fortunate to be up here in front of you.  But there is no football, there is no Hall of Fame, there is nothing without the fans.  Nothing without you.  We have nothing.  Got to realize that.  I don't care if you're a Giants fan, a Bills fan, a Raiders fan, I don't care what kind of fan you are, you're a football fan, and for that I'm sure I speak for everyone when I say thank you.  We appreciate you.  We applaud you.
In closing this up, I want to say the most important motivation for me throughout my career and even now in my life has never been tackles, accolades never been notoriety, never been money or Super Bowls or anything like that, it's these four people.  And I want them to stand up.  My daughter, Tanita, my son Michael, Jr., and my twins, Isabella and Sophia, my babies, my beautiful babies.
Now I want you --  and I hope, and this has always been my hope for my kids because I love them more than anything, is that I showed you and that you learned the improbability means nothing, because anything is absolutely possible.  Anything is possible.  Of all the titles that I have from everything.  You could name it.  The most important title I'm most proud of is Michael Strahan, your father, plain and simple.
In closing, I want to thank these guys up here with me.  I want to thank you all for being here.  For all of your patience.  I'm so glad that I am a representative of the 2014 NFL Hall of Fame. Thank you, and good night.3Embed",en,LABEL_0,0.44424107670783997,LABEL_1,0.5557589530944824

\ *‚Ä¢

Sr. Juez Federal Dr. Ariel O. Lijo:
ALBERTO NISMAN, Fiscal General, titular de la Unidad Fiscal de Investigaci√≥n del atentado perpetrado el 18 de julio de 1994 contra la sede de la AMIA  ante V.S. respetuosamente me presento y digo:
I.- Objeto
En cumplimiento del mandato legal impuesto en el art√≠culo 177 inciso Io del C√≥digo Procesal Penal de la Naci√≥n, como representante del Ministerio P√∫blico Fiscal a cargo de la Unidad de Investigaci√≥n de la causa ‚ÄúAMIA‚Äù vengo, por la presente, a denunciar la existencia de un plan delictivo destinado a dotar de impunidad a los imputados de nacionalidad iran√≠ acusados en dicha causa, para que eludan la investigaci√≥n y se sustraigan de la acci√≥n de la justicia argentina, con competencia en el caso.
Esta confabulaci√≥n ha sido orquestada y puesta en funcionamiento por altas autoridades del gobierno nacional argentino, con la colaboraci√≥n de terceros, en lo que constituye un accionar criminal configurativo, a priori, de los delitos de encubrimiento por favorecimiento
personal agravado, impedimento o estorbo del acto funcional e incumplimiento de los deberes de funcionario p√∫blico (arts. 277 inc. 1 y 3, 241 inc. 2 y 248 del C√≥digo Penal). Esto resulta de la mayor gravedad teniendo en cuenta que el hecho cuyo encubrimiento se denuncia, es decir, el atentado terrorista perpetrado contra la sede de la AMIA, ha sido judicialmente declarado crimen de lesa humanidad y calificado como genocidio por el Sr. Juez de la causa.
La decisi√≥n deliberada de encubrir a los imputados de origen iran√≠ acusados por el atentado terrorista del 18 de julio de 1994, como surge de las evidencias halladas, fue tomada por la cabeza del Poder Ejecutivo Nacional, Dra. Cristina Elisabet Fern√°ndez de Kirchner e instrumentada, principalmente, por el Ministro de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto de la Naci√≥n, Sr. H√©ctor Marcos Timerman.
Asimismo, las pruebas examinadas revelan la intervenci√≥n activa en el plan encubridor de varios sujetos con distintos grados de participaci√≥n y responsabilidad que la pesquisa deber√° precisar, entre los que cabe mencionar a: Luis Angel D‚ÄôEl√≠a, Femando Luis Esteche, Jorge Alejandro ‚ÄúYussuf‚Äô Khalil, el Diputado Nacional Andr√©s Larroque, el Dr. H√©ctor Luis Yrimia y un individuo identificado como ‚ÄúAlian‚Äù, que ha desempe√±ado un rol por dem√°s relevante en los hechos, que responde a la Secretaria de Inteligencia de Presidencia de la Naci√≥n y seg√∫n lo sugieren los indicios obtenidos, se tratar√≠a del Sr. Ram√≥n Alian H√©ctor Bogado.
Por otra parte, la investigaci√≥n deber√° tambi√©n determinar el rol exacto que le cupo a ciertos individuos respecto de quienes, prima facie, se cuenta con elementos que permiten colegir que no resultan ajenos a la maniobra delictiva denunciada, entre los cabe mencionar al Ministro de Planificaci√≥n Federal, Inversi√≥n P√∫blica y Servicios de la Naci√≥n, Arquitecto Julio De Vido.
Por √∫ltimo, corresponde a la pesquisa aqu√≠ propiciada la individualizaci√≥n y la determinaci√≥n de la responsabilidad penal que en los hechos delictivos denunciados pudieron haber tenido todas aquellas personas -funcionarios o no- que intervinieron en la elaboraci√≥n,
negociaci√≥n, concreci√≥n y consumaci√≥n del acuerdo firmado con la Rep√∫blica Isl√°mica de Ir√°n, como una de las v√≠as para lograr la impunidad. Esto incluye tanto a aquellos cuyos roles fueron de p√∫blico conocimiento, como a quienes eventualmente hayan participado sin que su intervenci√≥n haya tomado estado p√∫blico.
Introducci√≥n:
A lo largo de esta denuncia se expondr√°n los elementos probatorios que dejan en evidencia la existencia de un sofisticado plan delictivo, deliberadamente ideado para encubrir y dotar de impunidad a los acusados iran√≠es en la causa seguida por el atentado contra la sede de la AMIA, con el objeto de que eludan definitivamente a la justicia argentina y se sustraigan de ella.
Se ver√° tambi√©n que, para la √©poca en que se urdi√≥ e instrument√≥ el plan criminal, la urgencia energ√©tica que atravesaba y atraviesa nuestro pa√≠s y el anhelo por restablecer plenas relaciones comerciales a nivel estatal, ligados a una visi√≥n geopol√≠tica de acercamiento con la Rep√∫blica Isl√°mica de Ir√°n fueron, seg√∫n las pruebas con que se cuenta, los factores determinantes para que la primera mandataria, Dra. Cristina Elisabet Fern√°ndez, con la necesaria e inestimable participaci√≥n y colaboraci√≥n de H√©ctor Timerman, tomara la aciaga decisi√≥n de llevar adelante este plan de impunidad, sacrificando la justicia en el caso AMIA.
En efecto, quedar√° acreditado que esta confabulaci√≥n criminal fue decidida por la Sra. Presidente de la Naci√≥n y puesta en funcionamiento, principalmente, por su Ministro de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto, H√©ctor Marcos Timerman. Asimismo, se probar√° la activa participaci√≥n criminal de terceros en la maniobra, entre los que cabe mencionar a Luis √Ångel D‚ÄôEl√≠a; a Jorge Alejandro ‚ÄúYussuf‚Äô Khalil, al Diputado Nacional Andr√©s Larroque, a Fernando Esteche, al ex Fiscal designado para actuar en forma conjunta,
alterna o sucesiva en la causa AMIA, H√©ctor Luis Yrimia y a un individuo perteneciente a la Secretar√≠a de Inteligencia de Presidencia de la Naci√≥n, identificado como ‚ÄúAlian‚Äù que, seg√∫n las constancias halladas, todo indica que se tratar√≠a de Ram√≥n Alian H√©ctor Bogado.
En ese sentido, se presentar√°n las pruebas que ilustran que el plan que aqu√≠ se denuncia incluy√≥ negociaciones secretas y p√∫blicas con los iran√≠es, durante las cuales se acord√≥ dar de baja las notificaciones rojas de Interpol, y que dichas tratativas desembocaron en la firma de un Memorando de Entendimiento que, en su esencia, debe ser considerado como lo que realmente es: apenas uno de los medios elegidos por los aqu√≠ acusados para garantizar lo que se hab√≠a acordado de antemano, esto es, la impunidad de los pr√≥fugos iran√≠es y su desvinculaci√≥n definitiva de la causa.
Como se ver√° en detalle durante el desarrollo de la denuncia y se adelantar√° unos p√°rrafos m√°s abajo, la firma y ratificaci√≥n de tal documento implica lisa y llanamente la destrucci√≥n de las imputaciones contra los acusados de nacionalidad iran√≠. En primer lugar, porque las conclusiones de la llamada ‚ÄúComisi√≥n de la Verdad‚Äù, como as√≠ lo revela la evidencia, ya se encontraban previamente arregladas entre los signatarios. En segunda medida, como se verific√≥ en los hechos, debido a que el acuerdo fue la excusa que esgrimieron las partes para solicitar a Interpol que diera de baja las notificaciones rojas. En tercer t√©rmino, porque su confusa y ambigua redacci√≥n y las innumerables fases sucesivas previstas, sin plazo alguno, para que sus disposiciones sean aplicadas, permite que los socios en este acuerdo de impunidad aludan indefinidamente a la existencia del Memorando, aunque en la pr√°ctica no produzca efecto legal alguno.
Tambi√©n, se probar√° que el plan de impunidad perge√±ado por la Sra. Presidente de la Naci√≥n incluy√≥ un cambio de hip√≥tesis y un redireccionamiento de la investigaci√≥n judicial del caso AMIA, hacia ‚Äúnuevos imputados‚Äù, fundado en pruebas falsas y destinado a desvincular definitiva y fraudulentamente a los acusados iran√≠es. De hecho, algunos de los aqu√≠ acusados estuvieron expresamente abocados a fabricar esta hip√≥tesis falsa. Sab√≠an que la ‚ÄúComisi√≥n de la Verdad‚Äù no hab√≠a sido creada para investigar absolutamente nada, sino para legitimar la mentira que se estaba fabricando.
Se acreditar√° que este plan criminal tambi√©n involucr√≥ acuerdos secretos, por fuera del Memorando de Entendimiento. As√≠, se concert√≥ -en forma oculta- el cese de las notificaciones rojas de Interpol que pesaban y pesan sobre los funcionarios iran√≠es, por ser el inter√©s cardinal de Teher√°n para suscribir el acuerdo. Asimismo, se probar√° que secretamente se hab√≠a pactado que, en la pr√°ctica, el ex Ministro de Defensa iran√≠ y actual pr√≥fugo de la justicia argentina, Ahmad Vahidi, jam√°s ser√≠a interrogado, a pesar de lo estipulado en el Memorando, pues as√≠ hab√≠a sido convenido entre las partes: ‚Äúya hab√≠a sido conversado antes‚Äù.
Adem√°s, quedar√° evidenciado que los funcionarios involucrados en este plan criminal, ya sean argentinos o iran√≠es, han tenido un objetivo com√∫n. Que no se trata de dos partes negociando un acuerdo, como se lo quiso presentar p√∫blicamente, sino de dos socios buscando borrar -sin que nadie lo advierta- una imputaci√≥n penal en un delito de lesa humanidad.
M√°s a√∫n, aqu√≠ se demostrar√° que los pasos y avances del plan criminal fueron comunicados en tiempo real no solo a las autoridades iran√≠es, sino tambi√©n a uno de los pr√≥fugos de la causa AMIA, Mohsen Rabbani, quien particip√≥ de negociaciones comerciales con las autoridades argentinas involucradas en este plan e intervino en las tratativas dirigidas - fundamentalmente- a garantizar su propia impunidad.
Tambi√©n quedar√° evidenciado que se lanz√≥ una feroz campa√±a de descr√©dito hacia la investigaci√≥n del caso, destinada a horadar la versi√≥n judicial de los hechos, y se la combin√≥ con una campa√±a de enga√±o, compuesta por falacias, puestas en escena, mentiras, desmentidas, falsas promesas y la manipulaci√≥n a sobrevivientes y familiares de las v√≠ctimas del atentado, a fin de evitar que la opini√≥n p√∫blica conozca la entidad del verdadero objetivo encubridor oculto detr√°s del Memorando de Entendimiento firmado con Ir√°n.
Asimismo, se expondr√°n los elementos de prueba que acreditan que la Sra. Presidente y el Sr. Canciller efectuaron aportes en la necesaria divisi√≥n de tareas que implic√≥ esta compleja maniobra delictiva.
De las contribuciones concretas y espec√≠ficas de la Sra. Presidente que se han podido acreditar con s√≥lido sustento probatorio, surge con claridad que no solamente fue quien decidi√≥ la articulaci√≥n de este plan criminal de impunidad, sino que, para ello, se vali√≥ de distintos actores para llevar adelante su ejecuci√≥n, y en todo momento estuvo en control de la misma, ya sea impartiendo √≥rdenes directas a sus c√≥mplices, o bien encabezando la campa√±a discursiva y medi√°tica necesaria para camuflar la perpetraci√≥n del delito.
As√≠, ha elegido a algunos de los part√≠cipes de la maniobra delictiva, involucrando directamente a -cuanto menos- uno de sus ministros y a un legislador nacional; ha controlado la evoluci√≥n del plan en cada paso; ha negociado por interp√≥sitas personas con uno de los pr√≥fugos; y se ha involucrado personalmente en algunas acciones de ocultamiento que este sofisticado plan requer√≠a.
En la misma l√≠nea, se demostrar√° holgadamente que el Ministro de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto de la Naci√≥n, H√©ctor Timerman, ha sido - sin duda alguna- el principal instrumentador del plan de impunidad ideado y ordenado por la Sra. Presidente, Dra. Cristina Fern√°ndez.
Naturalmente, trat√°ndose de un plan criminal que ha involucrado a un pa√≠s extranjero, el Canciller ocupaba y ocupa el puesto clave para encargarse personalmente de muchos aspectos de este encubrimiento. Desde su funci√≥n, transmiti√≥ a Ir√°n la decisi√≥n del gobierno argentino de abandonar el reclamo de justicia en la causa AMIA; acord√≥ la baja de las notificaciones rojas; sign√≥ acuerdos secretos con la parte iran√≠; particip√≥ de las negociaciones, de la redacci√≥n y de la firma del Memorando de Entendimiento, pieza central del plan de impunidad. Y se involucr√≥ personalmente en la campa√±a de descr√©dito y enga√±o, destinada a destruir la credibilidad de la causa judicial con el fin de, dolosamente, presentar al acuerdo con Ir√°n como la √∫nica v√≠a apta para solucionar el caso.
Ambos funcionarios actuaron con un √∫nico y delictivo prop√≥sito: lograr la impunidad definitiva de los acusados iran√≠es y el cese de toda actividad jurisdiccional en su contra, en pos de restablecer plenas relaciones comerciales a nivel estatal y dar un paso hacia un acercamiento geopol√≠tico con la Rep√∫blica Isl√°mica de Ir√°n, sin soportar reproche alguno por parte de la sociedad argentina. Ello, seg√∫n surge de la evidencia reunida y sin descartar en modo alguno la existencia de otros motivos adicionales a los aqu√≠ expuestos, pero que en nada modificar√≠an o disminuir√≠an la criminal responsabilidad de los denunciados.
Quiz√° no resulte ocioso aclarar que nada hay de reprochable en la relaci√≥n comercial o la vinculaci√≥n geopol√≠tica entre estados. La objeci√≥n surge al comprobarse, n√≠tidamente, que dicho acercamiento implic√≥ por parte de las autoridades del gobierno argentino aqu√≠ denunciadas, sacrificar una causa judicial en tr√°mite, desconocer lo decidido por la justicia nacional y urdir un plan criminal para borrar de un plumazo las serias acusaciones que pesan sobre los pr√≥fugos iran√≠es, pretendiendo otorgarles impunidad definitiva. Algo in√©dito y nunca visto.
No se trata de una afirmaci√≥n dogm√°tica, se aportan en esta denuncia m√∫ltiples elementos probatorios que confirman que el anhelo por el petr√≥leo iran√≠ fue uno de los motores de las acciones delictivas denunciadas. A modo de ejemplo puede citarse una m√≠nima parte de la prueba descripta en este escrito, como cuando Femando Esteche, en diciembre de 2012, expres√≥ refiri√©ndose al gobierno argentino: ‚Äú...los tipos quieren restablecer relaciones entre los dos estados... o cuando Luis D‚ÄôEl√≠a, en mayo de 2013, agreg√≥: ‚Äú...ah√≠ habl√© con Julio  ...ac√° hay urgencia energ√©tica...ellos est√°n dispuestos a mandar a la gente de YPF a hacer negocios all√° [en alusi√≥n a Ir√°n '[...est√° muy interesado en cambiar lo de aquellos por granos y carne...‚Äù o, por √∫ltimo, cuando el agente iran√≠ en Buenos Aires, Jorge ‚ÄúYussuf‚Äô Khalil, confirm√≥ ‚Äú...el tema que necesita Argentina, es petr√≥leo...hay un verdadero inter√©s para empezar y entablar las relaciones comerciales de gobierno a gobierno, con funcionarios del gobierno de ac√°, una delegaci√≥n de all√° viajar√≠a o a Caracas o al Golfo o a Beirut mejor ...para empezar las relaciones directas de funcionarios a funcionarios... ‚Äù.
Por si ello no bastara, y aqu√≠ lo relevante, otras pruebas vienen a confirmar que el comienzo del intercambio comercial argentino-iran√≠ estaba supeditado a la ratificaci√≥n de Ir√°n del Memorando de Entendimiento, es decir, al avance del plan de impunidad. Viene al caso destacar lo dicho por Jorge Khalil, uno de los part√≠cipes de dicho plan: ‚ÄúAc√° hay luz verde para hacer las operaciones...el tema es que quieren que se apure el memor√°ndum...y se habl√≥ con De Vido...Argentina tiene una gran necesidad de petr√≥leo e Ir√°n tiene una gran necesidad de granos... Por otro lado, De Vido entiende que para dar un paso en esto, o sea oficial, de Estado a Estado, tiene que haber firma del Memor√°ndum
Y para sorpresa e indignaci√≥n de muchos, quedar√° evidenciado por la prueba reunida que en estas negociaciones particip√≥ nada menos que uno de los pr√≥fugos iran√≠es, Mohsen Rabbani, quien recib√≠a peri√≥dicos reportes telef√≥nicos de los avances que ocurr√≠an en el seno de nuestro gobierno. Para citar otro ejemplo de los tantos que constan en esta presentaci√≥n, se transcribe uno de los informes telef√≥nicos recibidos por Rabbani: ‚Äú...hoy terminamos una reuni√≥n con el Ministro de Planificaci√≥n De Vido, en donde √©l est√° dispuesto a mandar a las m√°ximas autoridades de YPF para arreglar con la Rep√∫blica Isl√°mica y la transacci√≥n puede ser a trav√©s de granos y a trav√©s de otras cosas... ‚Äù, a lo que Rabbani contest√≥: ‚Äúm√°ndeme para que eval√∫e‚Äù y luego de evaluarlo respondi√≥: ‚Äú...aqu√≠ hay algunos sectores del gobierno que me dijeron que est√°n listos para vender petr√≥leo a la Argentina...y tambi√©n comprar armas... ‚Äù
Es decir, mientras la justicia nacional acusaba y acusa fundadamente a ciertos funcionarios iran√≠es de haber decidido, planificado y ejecutado el atentado terrorista contra la sede de la AMIA y mientras p√∫blicamente la Sra. Presidente y el Sr. Canciller aseguraban que sus acciones estaban exclusivamente motivadas en la b√∫squeda de justicia para la causa AMIA y que el Memorando de Entendimiento era √∫nica soluci√≥n viable para el caso, uno de esos imputados, Mohsen Rabbani, secreta y clandestinamente negociaba con nuestras autoridades a trav√©s de intermediarios y canales ocultos, un intercambio de petr√≥leo por granos, la venta de armamento, y lo que es m√°s grave a√∫n: su impunidad.
Acaso resulte una obviedad pero no puede dejar de se√±alarse que las circunstancias denunciadas revisten una gravedad institucional extrema e inusitada, tanto por la jerarqu√≠a funcional de varios de los involucrados en la maniobra criminal como por la calificaci√≥n legal del delito que se encubre, esto es, el ‚Äúdelito anterior‚Äù objeto del encubrimiento, que es, ni m√°s ni menos, que el atentado terrorista a la sede de la AMIA, judicialmente declarado crimen de lesa humanidad y calificado de genocidio por el juez de la causa, Dr. Rodolfo Canicoba Corral.
Ahora bien, para contextualizar debidamente los hechos delictivos que se denuncian, resulta √∫til recordar que la justicia argentina determin√≥ que las m√°ximas autoridades iran√≠es de 1994 fueron quienes tomaron la decisi√≥n de atentar contra la AMIA, diagramaron la implementaci√≥n de ese ataque y encomendaron su ejecuci√≥n a la organizaci√≥n terrorista libanesa Hezbollah.
A consecuencia de ello se solicit√≥ la captura nacional e internacional del ex Presidente de la Rep√∫blica Isl√°mica de Ir√°n, Ali Akbar Hashemi Bahramaie Rafsanjani; del ex Ministro de Relaciones Exteriores, Ali Akbar Velayati; del ex Ministro de Inteligencia, Ali Fallahijan; del ex Jefe de la Guardia Revolucionaria, Mohsen Rezai; del ex Jefe de la Fuerza Al Quds y ex Ministro de Defensa, Ahmad Vahidi; del Ex Agregado Cultural de la Embajada iran√≠ en Argentina, Mohsen Rabbani; del ex Tercer Secretario de la Embajada de Ir√°n en Argentina, Ahmad Reza Asghari y del ex Embajador de la Rep√∫blica de Ir√°n en nuestro pa√≠s, Hadi Soleimpanpour. Desde el a√±o 2007, sobre cinco de tales imputados: Fallahijan, Rezai, Vahidi, Rabbani y Asghari pesan notificaciones rojas, es decir, la m√°xima prioridad de b√∫squeda que registra Interpol.
Con apoyatura en tales imputaciones, la Rep√∫blica Argentina ha venido reclamando por a√±os a la Rep√∫blica Isl√°mica de Ir√°n -hasta el momento, infructuosamente- la detenci√≥n con fines de extradici√≥n de los acusados iran√≠es.
En efecto, durante su presidencia, N√©stor Kirchner no solo llev√≥ el caso a la Asamblea General de la Organizaci√≥n de Naciones Unidas, sino que rechaz√≥ rotundamente todos los ofrecimientos de Teher√°n, siempre destinados a acordar una salida pol√≠ticamente negociada a esta cuesti√≥n, netamente judicial. Da cuenta esta presentaci√≥n de voluminosa prueba documental y de varios testimonios coincidentes -del ex Jefe de Gabinete, Alberto Fern√°ndez; de los ex Cancilleres, Rafael Bielsa y Jorge Taiana y del ex Vice Canciller, Roberto Garc√≠a Morit√°n- que describen los pactos propuestos por Ir√°n y su rechazo de plano por parte del ex presidente argentino.
Esa consistencia que durante a√±os tuvo la postura oficial argentina en torno al caso AMIA, sufri√≥ un cambio radical a partir de la decisi√≥n de la actual Presidente de avanzar en un plan encubridor que permita a los imputados iran√≠es eludir y sustraerse definitivamente al accionar de la justicia a efectos de facilitar, entre otros fines, un intercambio comercial a nivel estatal con la Rep√∫blica Isl√°mica de Ir√°n. Dando cuenta de ello, el ex canciller Bielsa resalt√≥ el cambio de posici√≥n del gobierno de la Dra. Fern√°ndez cuando sostuvo: ule dice a los familiares que los que comercian son las empresas y no el Estado. Me parece un argumento pelotudo, me fastidia mucho porque era un tema sagrado para N√©stor ....Cuando era canciller, hablar de venderle o comprarle a Ir√°n era casus belli ‚Äù.
As√≠ las cosas, por mucho tiempo la relaci√≥n bilateral estuvo signada por la indiferencia iran√≠ a los reclamos argentinos y, como contrapartida, por la s√≥lida resoluci√≥n de nuestro pa√≠s de no avanzar en ning√∫n frente vincular sin antes obtener cooperaci√≥n por parte de Teher√°n, es decir, la entrega de los acusados para su juzgamiento por la justicia nacional.
Se comprobar√° que, en este contexto hist√≥rico y con el cuadro de situaci√≥n descripto, entre octubre de 2010 y enero de 2011, el
gobierno argentino presidido por Cristina Fern√°ndez experiment√≥ un giro de 180 grados en relaci√≥n a su consideraci√≥n del caso AMIA. Efectivamente, aquel enero de 2011, H√©ctor Timerman viaj√≥ a la ciudad siria de Alepo y secretamente se reuni√≥ con su par iran√≠, Ali Akbar Salehi, a quien le hizo saber que las autoridades pol√≠ticas argentinas estaban dispuestas a renunciar a la investigaci√≥n del caso AMIA y a cualquier reclamo de cooperaci√≥n y justicia, con tal de provocar un acercamiento de orden geopol√≠tico y restablecer plenas relaciones comerciales entre ambos estados.
Quedar√° demostrado tambi√©n que el Canciller Salehi tom√≥ nota de tal ofrecimiento y se lo comunic√≥ al entonces Presidente Ahmadinejad: ‚Äú...Argentina ya no est√° m√°s interesada en resolver aquellos dos atentados...en cambio prefiere mejorar sus relaciones comerciales con Ir√°n ‚Äù. Es la primera vez que un estado agredido implora a un estado agresor que firme un acuerdo por el cual les otorgar√° impunidad a los agresores.
De este modo, comenz√≥ un per√≠odo de negociaci√≥n secreto entre los gobiernos de Argentina e Ir√°n que se extendi√≥ hasta septiembre de 2012 y durante el cual, ambas partes realizaron gestos que, a la luz de la prueba recolectada posteriormente y analizados en forma conjunta, claramente han sido indicativos del acuerdo que, en esa √©poca, se estaba incubando. Siempre a modo de ejemplo, dado el car√°cter introductorio de estos p√°rrafos, puede citarse que el gobierno argentino, en julio de 2011, calific√≥ de ‚Äúmuy positiva‚Äù una misiva de la canciller√≠a persa por la cual se ofrec√≠a colaborar con la investigaci√≥n, curiosamente, en una nueva hip√≥tesis, distinta a la esgrimida por la justicia.
Avanzadas dichas negociaciones secretas donde se gest√≥ el encubrimiento y el plan de impunidad de los iran√≠es, en el mes de septiembre de 2012, Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner oficializ√≥ las reuniones, siendo que, p√∫blicamente ante la Asamblea General de Naciones Unidas, adujo que la Rep√∫blica Isl√°mica de Ir√°n hab√≠a expresado su voluntad de negociar por el caso AMIA. Se entienden ahora los motivos por los cuales la Sra. Presidente, en aquella oportunidad y por primera vez, no invit√≥ a las instituciones comunitarias jud√≠as a formar parte de su comitiva a la apertura del Debate General de la citada asamblea internacional. El anuncio que har√≠a hab√≠a sido acordado con anterioridad y con una finalidad distinta a la que se invoc√≥.
Quedar√° aqu√≠ probado, que tal manifestaci√≥n de la Sra. Presidente fue solo una puesta en escena, la primera de muchas que ocurrir√≠an durante el camino que recorri√≥ el plan de impunidad ideado y orquestado por los funcionarios argentinos aqu√≠ denunciados. Con este gesto, se busc√≥ ocultar que el acercamiento hab√≠a sido promovido por Argentina, y no por Ir√°n como se dijo; y se quiso hacer creer que las negociaciones se iniciar√≠an entonces, cuando ya llevaban -al menos- un a√±o y medio.
As√≠, se acreditar√° que mientras transcurr√≠an las negociaciones diplom√°ticas p√∫blicas, el plan de impunidad avanzaba solapadamente a trav√©s de canales paralelos de comunicaci√≥n y negociaci√≥n con Ir√°n, gest√°ndose en aquel momento un aspecto fundamental del plan criminal: la desviaci√≥n de la investigaci√≥n hacia una nueva y falsa hip√≥tesis que incrimine a terceros inocentes, pero -fundamentalmente- desincrimine a los iran√≠es, tareas de las participaron activamente Jorge Khalil, Fernando Esteche, H√©ctor Yrimia y el sujeto conocido como ‚ÄúAlian‚Äù.
El resultado visible de las negociaciones, tanto secretas como p√∫blicas, fue el Memorando de Entendimiento firmado el 27 de enero de 2013 en Etiop√≠a. La versi√≥n oficial argentina indic√≥ que se trataba de un instrumento jur√≠dico que permitir√≠a avanzar con las indagatorias de los pr√≥fugos. La realidad fue que solo se trat√≥ de uno de los medios elegidos por las partes para viabilizar el plan criminal que negociaron durante dos a√±os, pues su letra resultaba y resulta funcional a esta maniobra espuria.
Que quede bien claro. El acuerdo entre representantes iran√≠es y las autoridades argentinas excede con creces la mera letra del memorando. El plan criminal consisti√≥ en la eliminaci√≥n de las imputaciones que la justicia argentina esgrimi√≥ contra funcionarios iran√≠es y el mejor modo que se hall√≥ para despejar tales acusaciones, brindar impunidad y presentar el
tema de la manera m√°s prolija posible a los ojos de la ciudadan√≠a enga√±ada, fue la suscripci√≥n del mencionado acuerdo bilateral.
Ello fue as√≠ porque su letra prev√© mecanismos para lograr la baja de las notificaciones rojas de Interpol, porque su aplicaci√≥n contiene tantas etapas sucesivas sin plazo alguno que permite prolongar indefinidamente su vigencia en el tiempo sin lograr avances reales, porque las conclusiones de la ‚ÄúComisi√≥n de la Verdad‚Äù ya estaban arregladas de antemano y su actuaci√≥n permite la introducci√≥n de la nueva hip√≥tesis falsa, armada con pruebas inventadas.
En efecto, como se ver√°, en la pr√°ctica, las √∫nicas trabas a la impunidad de hecho de la que gozan los acusados iran√≠es han sido las notificaciones rojas de Interpol, que tienen la capacidad de dificultar su movilidad trasnacional. Por ello, las partes acordaron hacerlas cesar. De all√≠ que el punto 7 del Memorando tenga su raz√≥n de ser. Tr√°tase del √∫nico punto que deb√≠a tener aplicaci√≥n inmediata, del √∫nico que tiene car√°cter operativo sin necesidad de que el acuerdo haya sido ratificado. Redactado en esos t√©rminos, carece de toda explicaci√≥n l√≥gica. Se advierte, entonces, que la baja de las notificaciones rojas fue el primer y trascendental paso acordado secretamente entre Salehi y Timerman hacia la desvinculaci√≥n definitiva de los imputados.
N√≥tese que, al mes de haberse firmado el Memorando de Entendimiento, el agente de inteligencia de Presidencia de la Naci√≥n ‚ÄúAlian‚Äù le comunic√≥ al operador iran√≠ Khalil, ‚ÄúTengo un chisme...me dijeron ah√≠ en 'la casa' ...Interpol va a levantar el pedido de capturas de los amigos ...lo va a levantar ahora‚Äù.
En forma sorpresiva e inesperada para los encubridores, Interpol advirti√≥ que se lo quiso involucrar donde nada ten√≠a que hacer e intercedi√≥ a tiempo para evitar la baja de las prioridades de b√∫squeda. Se ver√° c√≥mo esa intervenci√≥n se erigi√≥ en un obst√°culo inesperado para los autores del encubrimiento. Timerman no pudo cumplir lo que hab√≠a prometido en sus negociaciones secretas con Ir√°n, circunstancia que motiv√≥ la queja de los iran√≠es. Rep√°rese, adem√°s, que desde que Interpol comunic√≥ que las notificaciones rojas contra los acusados por el caso AMIA seguir√≠an vigentes, la Rep√∫blica Isl√°mica de Ir√°n retir√≥ el acuerdo de su agenda parlamentaria y hasta el momento en que se formula esta presentaci√≥n, no ha comunicado oficialmente su aprobaci√≥n interna.
El motivo de semejante vuelta atr√°s surge n√≠tido de las pruebas que se presentar√°n. El agente persa Khalil, al d√≠a siguiente de regresar de Ir√°n, comunic√≥ a las autoridades argentinas la raz√≥n de la tardanza, ante el reclamo local por la demora de Teher√°n en la aprobaci√≥n interna de Memorando de Entendimiento: ‚Äú...De Vido tiene que saber que Timerman no cumpli√≥ con algunas cosas. Esto es as√≠ de claro. No cumpli√≥ con algunas cosas...‚Äù y en otra oportunidad, expres√≥: ‚Äú...meparece que el ruso este de mierda  se mand√≥ alguna...estaba firmado algo, donde estaba el tema de las cautelares ... ‚Äù.
M√°s all√° de los ejemplos relatados, lo que se pretende dejar aqu√≠ en blanco sobre negro son dos conclusiones reveladoras que se desprenden de estos dichos, como de otras probanzas que tambi√©n se analizar√°n. La primera radica en la certidumbre sobre la existencia de una promesa por parte del canciller Timerman para dar de baja las notificaciones rojas. Timerman no cumpli√≥, no porque no haya querido, sino porque Interpol se lo impidi√≥. Incluso, podr√° apreciarse en esta denuncia que el Canciller volvi√≥ a la carga en los meses de septiembre y noviembre de 2013, con claras intenciones de convencer a Ronald Noble para que ceda y autorice el cese de las notificaciones rojas, bajo el argumento que el acuerdo entre las partes sigui√≥ avanzando, pero -por fortuna- tampoco entonces pudo lograr su cometido.
La segunda conclusi√≥n que se desprende de aquella conversaci√≥n transmite la certeza de que, adem√°s del Memorando de Entendimiento firmado, han existido entre las partes otros acuerdos secretos. Corrobora tal afirmaci√≥n, entre otras evidencias, el testimonio del propio Salehi, quien reconoci√≥ sin ambages: ‚ÄúInterpol debe eliminar las acusaciones contra las autoridades iran√≠es ....El  del acuerdo entre Ir√°n y Argentina en relaci√≥n con la cuesti√≥n AMIA ser√° hecho p√∫blico en el momento adecuado y la cuesti√≥n  est√° incluida y nosotros la estamos siguiendo...‚Äù. Habiendo sido realizada esta declaraci√≥n en el mes de marzo de 2013, resulta evidente que Salehi no se estaba refiriendo al Memorando de Entendimiento sino a otro convenio que a esa fecha a√∫n no se hab√≠a dado a conocer.
Y en este marco deben entenderse tambi√©n las manifestaciones de Jorge ‚ÄúYussuf‚Äô Khalil, cuando comentando noticias period√≠sticas que difund√≠an que el ex Ministro de Defensa iran√≠, Ahmad Vahidi, nunca ser√≠a interrogado pese a estar incluido en el Memorando, asegur√≥ que el rumor era cierto, que ese tema en particular ‚Äúestaba conversado antes....estaba dentro del marco ‚Äù y que el acuerdo era ‚Äúm√°s profundo todav√≠a ‚Äù.
Es decir, quedar√° probado que el Ministro de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto de la Naci√≥n, H√©ctor Timerman no solo firm√≥ un Memorando de Entendimiento abiertamente inconstitucional, que adem√°s garantiza la impunidad de los acusados iran√≠es, sino que tambi√©n cerr√≥ acuerdos secretos mucho m√°s beneficiosos para los pr√≥fugos. De all√≠ que se compruebe que no se trat√≥, como se present√≥ p√∫blicamente, de dos partes que negociaron un acuerdo bilateral, sino que fueron dos socios que confeccionaron un sofisticado plan criminal de impunidad para desligar definitivamente a los pr√≥fugos de la causa AMIA de toda relaci√≥n con el atentado y cerrar toda investigaci√≥n respecto de ellos. De hecho, luego de suscribirse el acuerdo, el agente argentino ‚ÄúAlian‚Äù le confes√≥ a su par de Ir√°n: ‚Äú...Tranquilo, ya ganamos, es decir, ganamos una partida, yo te dije, vos no me ten√≠as fe...‚Äù, dejando en evidencia que ambas partes han tenido el mismo objetivo criminal.
Ahora bien, surge de la evidencia detallada en la denuncia, que la oportuna intervenci√≥n de Interpol manteniendo vigentes las notificaciones rojas no frustr√≥ ni imposibilit√≥ a futuro el encubrimiento orquestado. Los autores hab√≠an tenido la precauci√≥n de idear mecanismos
alternativos para conseguir sus fines, contenidos en la letra del Memorando de Entendimiento.
Se advertir√° sobre los numeros√≠simos mecanismos previstos en el intrincado acuerdo bilateral. Naturalmente ello no ha sido fruto de la incompetencia de los redactores sino, todo lo contrario, de su sagacidad para dotar al Memorando de un enmara√±ado proceso de aplicaci√≥n que exige, para que un imputado iran√≠ se siente a escuchar los cargos de la justicia argentina, la verificaci√≥n de una largu√≠sima serie de procedimientos, alguno de ellos de imposible cumplimiento, atento a la incompatibilidad con sus respectivas legislaciones:	1) que ambos pa√≠ses ratifiquen
internamente los t√©rminos del acuerdo; 2) que se remitan mutuamente las notas reversales notificando dicha ratificaci√≥n; 3) que cada uno de los signatarios proceda a la elecci√≥n de personas de reconocida trayectoria jur√≠dica y probidad personal para que integren la ‚ÄúComisi√≥n de la Verdad‚Äù; 4) que los elegidos acepten la designaci√≥n; 5) que entre ambas partes y de com√∫n acuerdo, seleccionen un quinto miembro de la comisi√≥n; 6) que los miembros de la Comisi√≥n redacten las reglas del procedimiento al que se sujetar√°n; 7) que se pida informaci√≥n de la causa; 8) que se env√≠e la informaci√≥n requerida y se la traduzca; 9) que cada uno de los miembros de la comisi√≥n analice las pruebas remitidas; 10) que se re√∫nan para emitir recomendaciones; 11) que se notifiquen dichas recomendaciones a los signatarios; 12) que se establezca una fecha para cumplir con audiencias; 13) que se cite a los imputados; 14) que √©stos efectivamente comparezcan a un interrogatorio, que no re√∫ne -como se ver√°- las condiciones m√≠nimas para ser considerado una declaraci√≥n indagatoria v√°lida para el derecho argentino. Ninguno de estos pasos tiene plazo determinado para ser cumplido. Tan es as√≠, que ha pasado m√°s de un a√±o y medio desde la firma del Memorando y todav√≠a no se concluy√≥ siquiera el primer escal√≥n. Ir√°n a√∫n no ha comunicado la ratificaci√≥n del acuerdo. Puede verse con claridad que los t√©rminos de este pacto, reflejo de una actividad criminal subyacente, est√°n redactados de modo tal que muy sencillamente se puede demorar en forma i",es,1 star,0.32455116510391235,2 stars,0.22627398371696472

I did the whole yard in fucking 15 minutes
I will kill you (no I will kill you first)
No if you kill me, I will come back and I kill you
(You will never get me, I will run and I will hide
And you'll never find me, and I'll send somebody to kill you)
Ha-ha-ha, what's up 'Lero uh (Shreveport)
Check me out man, uh

I'm in the candy Benz, fancy lens
Fucking with this motherfucking, bad ass biatch
With fat ass tits, a big ol' ass
I come from the head, cause I think so fast
I'm the one, and not the two
Smoke pep lepue, make revenue
Old Western U', send me cash
I'm ake my do', and I paid the task
I paid Uncle Sam, I paid my band
I bought everybody, that Chimey Chan
I'm ean chicken wing, rice and gravy
I'ma throw a chicken wing, at my lady
Cause she pissed me off, with all that hate
Now she in the closet, duct taped
What's crackulating, what's obvilating
I'ma do boys, like Walter Payton
I'm the boss, while boys getting fucked off
I'm a high power, people mayn playing golf
Trying to put, but still I'm thugging
My golf club set, cost forty-five hundred
Love it leave it, lose it I'ma keep it
I'm ade it in this rap game, cause I cheated
I told my genie, make my albums sell
She said you already used, your three wishes in jail
Remember your first wish, behind the bars
You wished that you could fuck, the security
Well I hypnotized her, ad let you fuck her
You ate that bitch, like she was supper
Then your second wish, was to fuck her again
Then your third wish, was to get out the Penn
Now this makes four, but fuck it I'll do it
I'ma even have you, on Stevenson Pruit
So even though you sound like shit, and can't rap
You gon be the biggest fucking rapper, on the map
You mean all that stupid shit, that I write
People gon actually, think it's tight
That's right, plus you'll be the CEO
But stop wasting money, on Miss Cleo
Okay, I'ma call Jose
And tell him call the stations, that never gave us no play
And see what they say, maybe it'll work
And if it don't fuck it, I'll make my gun squirt
Y'all should join me, my skin is oily
Y'all don't want no beef, probably soy bean
No sir knowing, I flipped a coin
I saw her tits, and my dick went boing
At the car show, it's the third annual
I'm chilling with my boy, who Jack Daniels
I'm mixed, with a splash of coke
My girl mad, cause I bust a nut in one stroke
I'm a loc'd gangsta, shoot em up killa
There's something about Mary, like Ben Stiller
I'm a thriller chiller, like to fight in Menilla
I shot the tooth fairy, trying to reach under my pilla
I'm sorry, I didn't know it was you
She was putting ten dollas, for my daughter's tooth
I picked her up, and took her to the hospital
She flew out my car, I said this is impossible
I got out and said, you should go to the doctor
You lost a lot of blood, dumb bitch I just shot ya
She flew past a tree, looked at me
And said y'all won't be getting a nickel, for none of y'all teeth
Ah that ain't right, let's make a truse
My lil boy Los, got two teeth loose
And he needs the money, for a remote control car
I spent all my cash, at the butt naked bar
So I really need you, to come through with that change
I'm sorry bout the dress, and all the blood stains
Oh pleeeease, I'm on my kneeeees
I'm teaching my son, his ABCeeees
I'm just a damn fool, I fight my pitbull
He killed a dog, that belonged to Moham Mitchell
But he lost his last fight, and lost his eyesight
And now my dog's blind, I hope you don't mind
I know I'm dead wrong, come from the head strong
I hit my red bong, this song is so long
I'm talking nonsense, on freestyle projects
So check what's on next, I love you God bless

M. P. at the corner of Arbour hill there and be damned but a bloody sweep came along and he near drove his gear into my eye. I turned around to let him have the weight of my tongue when who should I see dodging along Stony Batter only Joe Hynes.
‚ÄîLo, Joe, says I. How are you blowing? Did you see that bloody chimneysweep near shove my eye out with his brush?
‚ÄîSoot's luck, says Joe. Who's the old ballocks you were talking to?
‚ÄîOld Troy, says I, was in the force. I'm on two minds not to give that fellow in charge for obstructing the thoroughfare with his brooms and ladders.
‚ÄîWhat are you doing round those parts? says Joe.
‚ÄîDevil a much, says I. There's a bloody big foxy thief beyond by the garrison church at the corner of Chicken lane‚Äîold Troy was just giving me a wrinkle about him‚Äîlifted any God's quantity of tea and sugar to pay three bob a week said he had a farm in the county Down off a hop-of-my-thumb by the name of Moses Herzog over there near Heytesbury street.
‚ÄîCircumcised? says Joe.
‚ÄîAy, says I. A bit off the top. An old plumber named Geraghty. I'm hanging on to his taw now for the past fortnight and I can't get a penny out of him.
‚ÄîThat the lay you're on now? says Joe.
‚ÄîAy, says I. How are the mighty fallen! Collector of bad and doubtful debts. But that's the most notorious bloody robber you'd meet in a day's walk and the face on him all pockmarks would hold a shower of rain. Tell him, says he, I dare him, says he, and I doubledare him to send you round here again or if he does, says he, I'll have him summonsed up before the court, so I will, for trading without a licence. And he after stuffing himself till he's fit to burst. Jesus, I had to laugh at the little jewy getting his shirt out. He drink me my teas. He eat me my sugars. Because he no pay me my moneys?
For nonperishable goods bought of Moses Herzog, of 13 Saint Kevin's parade in the city of Dublin, Wood quay ward, merchant, hereinafter called the vendor, and sold and delivered to Michael E. Geraghty, esquire, of 29 Arbour hill in the city of Dublin, Arran quay ward, gentleman, hereinafter called the purchaser, videlicet, five pounds avoirdupois of first choice tea at three shillings and no pence per pound avoirdupois and three stone avoirdupois of sugar, crushed crystal, at threepence per pound avoirdupois, the said purchaser debtor to the said vendor of one pound five shillings and sixpence sterling for value received which amount shall be paid by said purchaser to said vendor in weekly instalments every seven calendar days of three shillings and no pence sterling: and the said nonperishable goods shall not be pawned or pledged or sold or otherwise alienated by the said purchaser but shall be and remain and be held to be the sole and exclusive property of the said vendor to be disposed of at his good will and pleasure until the said amount shall have been duly paid by the said purchaser to the said vendor in the manner herein set forth as this day hereby agreed between the said vendor, his heirs, successors, trustees and assigns of the one part and the said purchaser, his heirs, successors, trustees and assigns of the other part.
‚ÄîAre you a strict t.t.? says Joe.
‚ÄîNot taking anything between drinks, says I.
‚ÄîWhat about paying our respects to our friend? says Joe.
‚ÄîWho? says I. Sure, he's out in John of God's off his head, poor man.
‚ÄîDrinking his own stuff? says Joe.
‚ÄîAy, says I. Whisky and water on the brain.
‚ÄîCome around to Barney Kiernan's, says Joe. I want to see the citizen.
‚ÄîBarney mavourneen's be it, says I. Anything strange or wonderful, Joe?
‚ÄîNot a word, says Joe. I was up at that meeting in the City Arms.
‚Äî-What was that, Joe? says I.
‚ÄîCattle traders, says Joe, about the foot and mouth disease. I want to give the citizen the hard word about it.
So we went around by the Linenhall barracks and the back of the courthouse talking of one thing or another. Decent fellow Joe when he has it but sure like that he never has it. Jesus, I couldn't get over that bloody foxy Geraghty, the daylight robber. For trading without a licence, says he.
In Inisfail the fair there lies a land, the land of holy Michan. There rises a watchtower beheld of men afar. There sleep the mighty dead as in life they slept, warriors and princes of high renown. A pleasant land it is in sooth of murmuring waters, fishful streams where sport the gurnard, the plaice, the roach, the halibut, the gibbed haddock, the grilse, the dab, the brill, the flounder, the pollock, the mixed coarse fish generally and other denizens of the aqueous kingdom too numerous to be enumerated. In the mild breezes of the west and of the east the lofty trees wave in different directions their firstclass foliage, the wafty sycamore, the Lebanonian cedar, the exalted planetree, the eugenic eucalyptus and other ornaments of the arboreal world with which that region is thoroughly well supplied. Lovely maidens sit in close proximity to the roots of the lovely trees singing the most lovely songs while they play with all kinds of lovely objects as for example golden ingots, silvery fishes, crans of herrings, drafts of eels, codlings, creels of fingerlings, purple seagems and playful insects. And heroes voyage from afar to woo them, from Eblana to Slievemargy, the peerless princes of unfettered Munster and of Connacht the just and of smooth sleek Leinster and of Cruahan's land and of Armagh the splendid and of the noble district of Boyle, princes, the sons of kings.
And there rises a shining palace whose crystal glittering roof is seen by mariners who traverse the extensive sea in barks built expressly for that purpose, and thither come all herds and fatlings and firstfruits of that land for O'Connell Fitzsimon takes toll of them, a chieftain descended from chieftains. Thither the extremely large wains bring foison of the fields, flaskets of cauliflowers, floats of spinach, pineapple chunks, Rangoon beans, strikes of tomatoes, drums of figs, drills of Swedes, spherical potatoes and tallies of iridescent kale, York and Savoy, and trays of onions, pearls of the earth, and punnets of mushrooms and custard marrows and fat vetches and bere and rape and red green yellow brown russet sweet big bitter ripe pomellated apples and chips of strawberries and sieves of gooseberries, pulpy and pelurious, and strawberries fit for princes and raspberries from their canes.
I dare him, says he, and I doubledare him. Come out here, Geraghty, you notorious bloody hill and dale robber!
And by that way wend the herds innumerable of bellwethers and flushed ewes and shearling rams and lambs and stubble geese and medium steers and roaring mares and polled calves and longwoods and storesheep and Cuffe's prime springers and culls and sowpigs and baconhogs and the various different varieties of highly distinguished swine and Angus heifers and polly bulllocks of immaculate pedigree together with prime premiated milchcows and beeves: and there is ever heard a trampling, cackling, roaring, lowing, bleating, bellowing, rumbling, grunting, champing, chewing, of sheep and pigs and heavyhooved kine from pasturelands of Lusk and Rush and Carrickmines and from the streamy vales of Thomond, from the M'Gillicuddy's reeks the inaccessible and lordly Shannon the unfathomable, and from the gentle declivities of the place of the race of Kiar, their udders distended with superabundance of milk and butts of butter and rennets of cheese and farmer's firkins and targets of lamb and crannocks of corn and oblong eggs in great hundreds, various in size, the agate with this dun.
So we turned into Barney Kiernan's and there, sure enough, was the citizen up in the corner having a great confab with himself and that bloody mangy mongrel, Garryowen, and he waiting for what the sky would drop in the way of drink.
‚ÄîThere he is, says I, in his gloryhole, with his cruiskeen lawn and his load of papers, working for the cause.
The bloody mongrel let a grouse out of him would give you the creeps. Be a corporal work of mercy if someone would take the life of that bloody dog. I'm told for a fact he ate a good part of the breeches off a constabulary man in Santry that came round one time with a blue paper about a licence.
‚ÄîStand and deliver, says he.
‚ÄîThat's all right, citizen, says Joe. Friends here.
‚ÄîPass, friends, says he.
Then he rubs his hand in his eye and says he:
‚ÄîWhat's your opinion of the times?
Doing the rapparee and Rory of the hill. But, begob, Joe was equal to the occasion.
‚ÄîI think the markets are on a rise, says he, sliding his hand down his fork.
So begob the citizen claps his paw on his knee and he says:
‚ÄîForeign wars is the cause of it.
And says Joe, sticking his thumb in his pocket:
‚ÄîIt's the Russians wish to tyrannise.
‚ÄîArrah, give over your bloody codding, Joe, says I. I've a thirst on me I wouldn't sell for half a crown.
‚ÄîGive it a name, citizen, says Joe.
‚ÄîWine of the country, says he.
‚ÄîWhat's yours? says Joe.
‚ÄîDitto MacAnaspey, says I.
‚ÄîThree pints, Terry, says Joe. And how's the old heart, citizen? says he.
‚ÄîNever better, a chara, says he. What Garry? Are we going to win? Eh?
And with that he took the bloody old towser by the scruff of the neck and, by Jesus, he near throttled him.
The figure seated on a large boulder at the foot of a round tower was that of a broadshouldered deepchested stronglimbed frankeyed redhaired freelyfreckled shaggybearded widemouthed largenosed longheaded deepvoiced barekneed brawnyhanded hairylegged ruddyfaced sinewyarmed hero. From shoulder to shoulder he measured several ells and his rocklike mountainous knees were covered, as was likewise the rest of his body wherever visible, with a strong growth of tawny prickly hair in hue and toughness similar to the mountain gorse (Ulex Europeus). The widewinged nostrils, from which bristles of the same tawny hue projected, were of such capaciousness that within their cavernous obscurity the fieldlark might easily have lodged her nest. The eyes in which a tear and a smile strove ever for the mastery were of the dimensions of a goodsized cauliflower. A powerful current of warm breath issued at regular intervals from the profound cavity of his mouth while in rhythmic resonance the loud strong hale reverberations of his formidable heart thundered rumblingly causing the ground, the summit of the lofty tower and the still loftier walls of the cave to vibrate and tremble.
He wore a long unsleeved garment of recently flayed oxhide reaching to the knees in a loose kilt and this was bound about his middle by a girdle of plaited straw and rushes. Beneath this he wore trews of deerskin, roughly stitched with gut. His nether extremities were encased in high Balbriggan buskins dyed in lichen purple, the feet being shod with brogues of salted cowhide laced with the windpipe of the same beast. From his girdle hung a row of seastones which jangled at every movement of his portentous frame and on these were graven with rude yet striking art the tribal images of many Irish heroes and heroines of antiquity, Cuchulin, Conn of hundred battles, Niall of nine hostages, Brian of Kincora, the ardri Malachi, Art MacMurragh, Shane O'Neill, Father John Murphy, Owen Roe, Patrick Sarsfield, Red Hugh O'Donnell, Red Jim MacDermott, Soggarth Eoghan O'Growney, Michael Dwyer, Francy Higgins, Henry Joy M'Cracken, Goliath, Horace Wheatley, Thomas Conneff, Peg Woffington, the Village Blacksmith, Captain Moonlight, Captain Boycott, Dante Alighieri, Christopher Columbus, S.

A couched spear of acuminated granite rested by him while at his feet reposed a savage animal of the canine tribe whose stertorous gasps announced that he was sunk in uneasy slumber, a supposition confirmed by hoarse growls and spasmodic movements which his master repressed from time to time by tranquilising blows of a mighty cudgel rudely fashioned out of paleolithic stone.
So anyhow Terry brought the three pints Joe was standing and begob the sight nearly left my eyes when I saw him land out a quid O, as true as I'm telling you. A goodlooking sovereign.
‚ÄîAnd there's more where that came from, says he.
‚ÄîWere you robbing the poorbox, Joe? says I.
‚ÄîSweat of my brow, says Joe. 'Twas the prudent member gave me the wheeze.
‚ÄîI saw him before I met you, says I, sloping around by Pill lane and Greek street with his cod's eye counting up all the guts of the fish.
Who comes through Michan's land, bedight in sable armour? O'Bloom, the son of Rory: it is he. Impervious to fear is Rory's son: he of the prudent soul.
‚ÄîFor the old woman of Prince's street, says the citizen, the subsidised organ. The pledgebound party on the floor of the house. And look at this blasted rag, says he. Look at this, says he. The Irish Independent, if you please, founded by Parnell to be the workingman's friend. Listen to the births and deaths in the Irish all for Ireland Independent, and I'll thank you and the marriages.
And he starts reading them out:
‚ÄîGordon, Barnfield crescent, Exeter; Redmayne of Iffley, Saint Anne's on Sea: the wife of William T Redmayne of a son. How's that, eh? Wright and Flint, Vincent and Gillett to Rotha Marion daughter of Rosa and the late George Alfred Gillett, 179 Clapham road, Stockwell, Playwood and Ridsdale at Saint Jude's, Kensington by the very reverend Dr Forrest, dean of Worcester. Eh? Deaths. Bristow, at Whitehall lane, London: Carr, Stoke Newington, of gastritis and heart disease: Cockburn, at the Moat house, Chepstow...
‚ÄîI know that fellow, says Joe, from bitter experience.
‚ÄîCockburn. Dimsey, wife of David Dimsey, late of the admiralty: Miller, Tottenham, aged eightyfive: Welsh, June 12, at 35 Canning street, Liverpool, Isabella Helen. How's that for a national press, eh, my brown son! How's that for Martin Murphy, the Bantry jobber?
‚ÄîAh, well, says Joe, handing round the boose. Thanks be to God they had the start of us. Drink that, citizen.
‚ÄîI will, says he, honourable person.
‚ÄîHealth, Joe, says I. And all down the form.
Ah! Ow! Don't be talking! I was blue mouldy for the want of that pint. Declare to God I could hear it hit the pit of my stomach with a click.
And lo, as they quaffed their cup of joy, a godlike messenger came swiftly in, radiant as the eye of heaven, a comely youth and behind him there passed an elder of noble gait and countenance, bearing the sacred scrolls of law and with him his lady wife a dame of peerless lineage, fairest of her race.
Little Alf Bergan popped in round the door and hid behind Barney's snug, squeezed up with the laughing. And who was sitting up there in the corner that I hadn't seen snoring drunk blind to the world only Bob Doran. I didn't know what was up and Alf kept making signs out of the door. And begob what was it only that bloody old pantaloon Denis Breen in his bathslippers with two bloody big books tucked under his oxter and the wife hotfoot after him, unfortunate wretched woman, trotting like a poodle. I thought Alf would split.
‚ÄîLook at him, says he. Breen. He's traipsing all round Dublin with a postcard someone sent him with U. p: up on it to take a li...
And he doubled up.
‚ÄîTake a what? says I.
‚ÄîLibel action, says he, for ten thousand pounds.
‚ÄîO hell! says I.
The bloody mongrel began to growl that'd put the fear of God in you seeing something was up but the citizen gave him a kick in the ribs.
‚ÄîBi i dho husht, says he.
‚ÄîWho? says Joe.
‚ÄîBreen, says Alf. He was in John Henry Menton's and then he went round to Collis and Ward's and then Tom Rochford met him and sent him round to the subsheriff's for a lark. O God, I've a pain laughing. U. p: up. The long fellow gave him an eye as good as a process and now the bloody old lunatic is gone round to Green street to look for a G man.
‚ÄîWhen is long John going to hang that fellow in Mountjoy? says Joe.
‚ÄîBergan, says Bob Doran, waking up. Is that Alf Bergan?
‚ÄîYes, says Alf. Hanging? Wait till I show you. Here, Terry, give us a pony. That bloody old fool! Ten thousand pounds. You should have seen long John's eye. U. p...
And he started laughing.
‚ÄîWho are you laughing at? says Bob Doran. Is that Bergan?
‚ÄîHurry up, Terry boy, says Alf.
Terence O'Ryan heard him and straightway brought him a crystal cup full of the foamy ebon ale which the noble twin brothers Bungiveagh and Bungardilaun brew ever in their divine alevats, cunning as the sons of deathless Leda. For they garner the succulent berries of the hop and mass and sift and bruise and brew them and they mix therewith sour juices and bring the must to the sacred fire and cease not night or day from their toil, those cunning brothers, lords of the vat.
Then did you, chivalrous Terence, hand forth, as to the manner born, that nectarous beverage and you offered the crystal cup to him that thirsted, the soul of chivalry, in beauty akin to the immortals.
But he, the young chief of the O'Bergan's, could ill brook to be outdone in generous deeds but gave therefor with gracious gesture a testoon of costliest bronze. Thereon embossed in excellent smithwork was seen the image of a queen of regal port, scion of the house of Brunswick, Victoria her name, Her Most Excellent Majesty, by grace of God of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and of the British dominions beyond the sea, queen, defender of the faith, Empress of India, even she, who bore rule, a victress over many peoples, the wellbeloved, for they knew and loved her from the rising of the sun to the going down thereof, the pale, the dark, the ruddy and the ethiop.
‚ÄîWhat's that bloody freemason doing, says the citizen, prowling up and down outside?
‚ÄîWhat's that? says Joe.
‚ÄîHere you are, says Alf, chucking out the rhino. Talking about hanging, I'll show you something you never saw. Hangmen's letters. Look at here.
So he took a bundle of wisps of letters and envelopes out of his pocket.
‚ÄîAre you codding? says I.
‚ÄîHonest injun, says Alf. Read them.
So Joe took up the letters.
‚ÄîWho are you laughing at? says Bob Doran.
So I saw there was going to be a bit of a dust Bob's a queer chap when the porter's up in him so says I just to make talk:
‚ÄîHow's Willy Murray those times, Alf?
‚ÄîI don't know, says Alf I saw him just now in Capel street with Paddy Dignam. Only I was running after that...
‚ÄîYou what? says Joe, throwing down the letters. With who?
‚ÄîWith Dignam, says Alf.
‚ÄîIs it Paddy? says Joe.
‚ÄîYes, says Alf. Why?
‚ÄîDon't you know he's dead? says Joe.
‚ÄîPaddy Dignam dead! says Alf.
‚ÄîAy, says Joe.
‚ÄîSure I'm after seeing him not five minutes ago, says Alf, as plain as a pikestaff.
‚ÄîWho's dead? says Bob Doran.
‚ÄîYou saw his ghost then, says Joe, God between us and harm.
‚ÄîWhat? says Alf. Good Christ, only five... What?... And Willy Murray with him, the two of them there near whatdoyoucallhim's... What? Dignam dead?
‚ÄîWhat about Dignam? says Bob Doran. Who's talking about...?
‚ÄîDead! says Alf. He's no more dead than you are.
‚ÄîMaybe so, says Joe. They took the liberty of burying him this morning anyhow.
‚ÄîPaddy? says Alf.
‚ÄîAy, says Joe. He paid the debt of nature, God be merciful to him.
‚ÄîGood Christ! says Alf.
Begob he was what you might call flabbergasted.
In the darkness spirit hands were felt to flutter and when prayer by tantras had been directed to the proper quarter a faint but increasing luminosity of ruby light became gradually visible, the apparition of the etheric double being particularly lifelike owing to the discharge of jivic rays from the crown of the head and face. Communication was effected through the pituitary body and also by means of the orangefiery and scarlet rays emanating from the sacral region and solar plexus. Questioned by his earthname as to his whereabouts in the heavenworld he stated that he was now on the path of pr l ya or return but was still submitted to trial at the hands of certain bloodthirsty entities on the lower astral levels. In reply to a question as to his first sensations in the great divide beyond he stated that previously he had seen as in a glass darkly but that those who had passed over had summit possibilities of atmic development opened up to them. Interrogated as to whether life there resembled our experience in the flesh he stated that he had heard from more favoured beings now in the spirit that their abodes were equipped with every modern home comfort such as talafana, alavatar, hatakalda, wataklasat and that the highest adepts were steeped in waves of volupcy of the very purest nature. Having requested a quart of buttermilk this was brought and evidently afforded relief. Asked if he had any message for the living he exhorted all who were still at the wrong side of Maya to acknowledge the true path for it was reported in devanic circles that Mars and Jupiter were out for mischief on the eastern angle where the ram has power. It was then queried whether there were any special desires on the part of the defunct and the reply was: We greet you, friends of earth, who are still in the body. Mind C. K. doesn't pile it on. It was ascertained that the reference was to Mr Cornelius Kelleher, manager of Messrs H. J. O'Neill's popular funeral establishment, a personal friend of the defunct, who had been responsible for the carrying out of the interment arrangements. Before departing he requested that it should be told to his dear son Patsy that the other boot which he had been looking for was at present under the commode in the return room and that the pair should be sent to Cullen's to be soled only as the heels were still good. He stated that this had greatly perturbed his peace of mind in the other region and earnestly requested that his desire should be made known.
Assurances were given that the matter would be attended to and it was intimated that this had given satisfaction.
He is gone from mortal haunts: O'Dignam, sun of our morning. Fleet was his foot on the bracken: Patrick of the beamy brow. Wail, Banba, with your wind: and wail, O ocean, with your whirlwind.
‚ÄîThere he is again, says the citizen, staring out.
‚ÄîWho? says I.
‚ÄîBloom, says he. He's on point duty up and down there for the last ten minutes.
And, begob, I saw his physog do a peep in and then slidder off again.
Little Alf was knocked bawways. Faith, he was.
‚ÄîGood Christ! says he. I could have sworn it was him.
And says Bob Doran, with the hat on the back of his poll, lowest blackguard in Dublin when he's under the influence:
‚ÄîWho said Christ is good?
‚ÄîI beg your parsnips, says Alf.
‚ÄîIs that a good Christ, says Bob Doran, to take away poor little Willy Dignam?
‚ÄîAh, well, says Alf, trying to pass it off. He's over all his troubles.
But Bob Doran shouts out of him.
‚ÄîHe's a bloody ruffian, I say, to take away poor little Willy Dignam.
Terry came down and tipped him the wink to keep quiet, that they didn't want that kind of talk in a respectable licensed premises. And Bob Doran starts doing the weeps about Paddy Dignam, true as you're there.
‚ÄîThe finest man, says he, snivelling, the finest purest character.
The tear is bloody near your eye. Talking through his bloody hat. Fitter for him go home to the little sleepwalking bitch he married, Mooney, the bumbailiff's daughter, mother kept a kip in Hardwicke street, that used to be stravaging about the landings Bantam Lyons told me that was stopping there at two in the morning without a stitch on her, exposing her person, open to all comers, fair field and no favour.
‚ÄîThe noblest, the truest, says he. And he's gone, poor little Willy, poor little Paddy Dignam.
And mournful and with a heavy heart he bewept the extinction of that beam of heaven.
Old Garryowen started growling again at Bloom that was skeezing round the door.
‚ÄîCome in, come on, he won't eat you, says the citizen.
So Bloom slopes in with his cod's eye on the dog and he asks Terry was Martin Cunningham there.
‚ÄîO, Christ M'Keown, says Joe, reading one of the letters. Listen to this, will you?
And he starts reading out one.
7 Hunter Street, Liverpool. To the High Sheriff of Dublin, Dublin.
Honoured sir i beg to offer my services in the abovementioned painful case i hanged Joe Gann in Bootle jail on the 12 of Febuary 1900 and i hanged...
‚ÄîShow us, Joe, says I.
‚Äî... private Arthur Chace for fowl murder of Jessie Tilsit in Pentonville prison and i was assistant when...
‚ÄîJesus, says I.
‚Äî... Billington executed the awful murderer Toad Smith...
The citizen made a grab at the letter.
‚ÄîHold hard, says Joe, i have a special nack of putting the noose once in he can't get out hoping to be favoured i remain, honoured sir, my terms is five ginnees.
H. RUMBOLD, MASTER BARBER.
‚ÄîAnd a barbarous bloody barbarian he is too, says the citizen.
‚ÄîAnd the dirty scrawl of the wretch, says Joe. Here, says he, take them to hell out of my sight, Alf. Hello, Bloom, says he, what will you have?
So they started arguing about the point, Bloom saying he wouldn't and he couldn't and excuse him no offence and all to that and then he said well he'd just take a cigar. Gob, he's a prudent member and no mistake.
‚ÄîGive us one of your prime stinkers, Terry, says Joe.
And Alf was telling us there was one chap sent in a mourning card with a black border round it.
‚ÄîThey're all barbers, says he, from the black country that would hang their own fathers for five quid down and travelling expenses.
And he was telling us there's two fellows waiting below to pull his heels down when he gets the drop and choke him properly and then they chop up the rope after and sell the bits for a few bob a skull.
In the dark land they bide, the vengeful knights of the razor. Their deadly coil they grasp: yea, and therein they lead to Erebus whatsoever wight hath done a deed of blood for I will on nowise suffer it even so saith the Lord.
So they started talking about capital punishment and of course Bloom comes out with the why and the wherefore and all the codology of the business and the old dog smelling him all the time I'm told those jewies does have a sort of a queer odour coming off them for dogs about I don't know what all deterrent effect and so forth and so on.
‚ÄîThere's one thing it hasn't a deterrent effect on, says Alf.
‚ÄîWhat's that? says Joe.
‚ÄîThe poor bugger's tool that's being hanged, says Alf.
‚ÄîThat so? says Joe.
‚ÄîGod's truth, says Alf. I heard that from the head warder that was in
Kilmainham when they hanged Joe Brady, the invincible. He told me when they cut him down after the drop it was standing up in their faces like a poker.
‚ÄîRuling passion strong in death, says Joe, as someone said.
‚ÄîThat can be explained by science, says Bloom. It's only a natural phenomenon, don't you see, because on account of the...
And then he starts with his jawbreakers about phenomenon and science and this phenomenon and the other phenomenon.
The distinguished scientist Herr Professor Luitpold Blumenduft tendered medical evidence to the effect that the instantaneous fracture of the cervical vertebrae and consequent scission of the spinal cord would, according to the best approved tradition of medical science, be calculated to inevitably produce in the human subject a violent ganglionic stimulus of the nerve centres of the genital apparatus, thereby causing the elastic pores of the corpora cavernosa to rapidly dilate in such a way as to instantaneously facilitate the flow of blood to that part of the human anatomy known as the penis or male organ resulting in the phenomenon which has been denominated by the faculty a morbid upwards and outwards philoprogenitive erection in articulo mortis per diminutionem capitis.
So of course the citizen was only waiting for the wink of the word and he starts gassing out of him about the invincibles and the old guard and the men of sixtyseven and who fears to speak of ninetyeight and Joe with him about all the fellows that were hanged, drawn and transported for the cause by drumhead courtmartial and a new Ireland and new this, that and the other. Talking about new Ireland he ought to go and get a new dog so he ought. Mangy ravenous brute sniffing and sneezing all round the place and scratching his scabs. And round he goes to Bob Doran that was standing Alf a half one sucking up for what he could get. So of course Bob Doran starts doing the bloody fool with him:
‚ÄîGive us the paw! Give the paw, doggy! Good old doggy! Give the paw here! Give us the paw!
Arrah, bloody end to the paw he'd paw and Alf trying to keep him from tumbling off the bloody stool atop of the bloody old dog and he talking all kinds of drivel about training by kindness and thoroughbred dog and intelligent dog: give you the bloody pip. Then he starts scraping a few bits of old biscuit out of the bottom of a Jacobs' tin he told Terry to bring. Gob, he golloped it down like old boots and his tongue hanging out of him a yard long for more. Near ate the tin and all, hungry bloody mongrel.
And the citizen and Bloom having an argument about the point, the brothers Sheares and Wolfe Tone beyond on Arbour Hill and Robert Emmet and die for your country, the Tommy Moore touch about Sara Curran and she's far from the land. And Bloom, of course, with his knockmedown cigar putting on swank with his lardy face. Phenomenon! The fat heap he married is a nice old phenomenon with a back on her like a ballalley. Time they were stopping up in the City Arms pisser Burke told me there was an old one there with a cracked loodheramaun of a nephew and Bloom trying to get the soft side of her doing the mollycoddle playing b√©zique to come in for a bit of the wampum in her will and not eating meat of a Friday because the old one was always thumping her craw and taking the lout out for a walk. And one time he led him the rounds of Dublin and, by the holy farmer, he never cried crack till he brought him home as drunk as a boiled owl and he said he did it to teach him the evils of alcohol and by herrings, if the three women didn't near roast him, it's a queer story, the old one, Bloom's wife and Mrs O'Dowd that kept the hotel. Jesus, I had to laugh at pisser Burke taking them off chewing the fat. And Bloom with his but don't you see? and but on the other hand. And sure, more be token, the lout I'm told was in Power's after, the blender's, round in Cope street going home footless in a cab five times in the week after drinking his way through all the samples in the bloody establishment. Phenomenon!
‚ÄîThe memory of the dead, says the citizen taking up his pintglass and glaring at Bloom.
‚ÄîAy, ay, says Joe.
‚ÄîYou don't grasp my point, says Bloom. What I mean is...
‚ÄîSinn Fein! says the citizen. Sinn Fein amhain! The friends we love are by our side and the foes we hate before us.
The last farewell was affecting in the extreme. From the belfries far and near the funereal deathbell tolled unceasingly while all around the gloomy precincts rolled the ominous warning of a hundred muffled drums punctuated by the hollow booming of pieces of ordnance. The deafening claps of thunder and the dazzling flashes of lightning which lit up the ghastly scene testified that the artillery of heaven had lent its supernatural pomp to the already gruesome spectacle. A torrential rain poured down from the floodgates of the angry heavens upon the bared heads of the assembled multitude which numbered at the lowest computation five hundred thousand persons. A posse of Dublin Metropolitan police superintended by the Chief Commissioner in person maintained order in the vast throng for whom the York street brass and reed band whiled away the intervening time by admirably rendering on their blackdraped instruments the matchless melody endeared to us from the cradle by Speranza's plaintive muse.

THE VAMPIRE IN LITERATURE
A consideration of the Vampire theme in literature must of necessity be somewhat eclectic, if not even arbitrary in the selection of works which it reviews and with which it sets out to deal. Any exhaustive inquiry is well-nigh impossible, and this not so much, perhaps, on account of the wealth of the material, although indeed there is a far vaster field than might generally be supposed, as owing to the very vague definition and indeterminate interpretation one is able to give to vampirism from a purely literary point of view. It is the craft of an artist in the telling of ghost-stories to see that his colours should not be too vivid and too clear, and no mean skill is required to suggest without explanation, to mass the shadows without derangement, to be occult yet not to be obscure. Accordingly it would be a matter of extreme difficulty to differentiate the malignant and death-dealing spectre or it may be even corpse who returns to wreak his foul revenge from the Vampire,--using this latter word in its widest sense, as one must employ it when speaking of literature, a caution which here given as regards this Chapter will serve once for all. In such a story, for example, as Dr. M. R. James' Count Magnus is the horrible revenant a ghost or a vampire? The writer has left the point ambiguous. It is of the very essence of his happy invention that he should do so, and the deftly veiled incertitude adds to the loathly terror of the thing. It will be readily remembered that the story relates how a traveller in Sweden about the middle of the last century whilst staying near an ancient manor house in Vestergothland obtains permission to examine the family papers and among these he comes upon the traces of a certain Count Magnus de la Gardie who in the year 1600 had built the house or herrg√•rd. Even after the lapse of two and a half centuries dark traditions are still lingering concerning this mysterious nobleman, whose body lies in a richly ornate copper sarcophagus that stands the principal feature of a domed mausoleum at the eastern end of the church. Reluctantly the landlord tells a story which happened in the time of his grandfather ninety-two years before. Two men determined to go at night and have a free hunt in the woods upon the estate. They are warned: ""No, do not go; we are sure you will meet with persons walking who should not be walking. They should be resting, not walking."" The two men laughed and cried: ""The Count is dead; we do not care for him."" But in the night the villagers ""hear someone scream, just as if the most inside part of his soul was twisted out of him."" Then they hear a hideous laugh, ""it was not one of those two men that laughed, and, indeed, they have all of them said that it was not any man at all."" In the morning they go out with the priest, and they find one of the men dead, killed in so terrible a fashion that they buried him on the spot. ""He was once a beautiful man, but now his face was not there, because the flesh of it was sucked away off the bones."" The other man is standing with his back against a tree, ""pushing with his hands-pushing something away from him which was not there.""
There was some vague gossip that the Count had been ""on the Black Pilgrimage, and had brought something or someone back with him."" During his investigation of the papers the English traveller, Mr. Wraxall, found a Liber nigrae peregrinationis, or at least a few lines of such a document indicating that the Count had once journeyed to the city of Chorazin and there adored the prince of the air. In careless mood as he is passing near the mausoleum, Mr. Wraxall exclaims: ""Ah, Count Magnus, there you are. I should dearly like to see you."" He is indiscreet enough to cry out thus flippantly on two further occasions, and at last he is thoroughly alarmed by hearing the sound of metal hinges creaking and he knows that the sarcophagus is slowly opening wide. In a state of frenzied fear he sets out for England the next day, yet turn and double as he will he is everywhere haunted by two hideous figures, a man in a long black cloak and a broad-leafed hat and something in a dark cloak and hood. Upon landing at Harwich he makes his way across country to a neighbouring village, when on looking out of the carriage window he sees at a cross-road the two horrible creatures. He finds a lodging, but within the next forty-eight hours his pursuers fall upon him. He is discovered dead, and in the district it is still remembered how ""the jury that viewed the body fainted, seven of 'em did, and none of 'em wouldn't speak to what they see, and the verdict was visitation of God; and how the people as kep' the 'ouse moved out that same week and went away from that part.""
This story may, I think, certainly be considered as Vampire lore, and although it must, of course, be perfectly familiar to all who delight in tales of the supernatural I have related it at some little length here, partly because it is told so excellently well, and partly because it so admirably fulfils and exemplifies the qualities that this kind of literature should possess. It is brief and succinct, although there are many details, but every touch tells. No ghost story should be of any length. The horror and the awe evaporate with prolixity. The ghost is malevolent and odious. In fiction a helpful apparition is a notable weakness, and the whole narrative becomes flabby to a degree. The authentic note of horror is struck in the eerie suggestion which, as we have noticed, is of intent left ill-defined. Nothing could be more crude than an explanation, and it is this banality that often ruins a story which otherwise might be of the very first order.
To review the traces of vampire legends which appear in sagas, and which are in truth but few and unimportant, seems to be outside our province here, and even more foreign to our purpose would be the present examination of the vampire legend in folk-lore since this has already been dealt with in the course of the preceding chapters, and to regard such traditions merely as literature would be not only to look at them from a wrong perspective but to misrepresent their quality and essentially to pervert their purpose.
Since some point must be chosen at which to consider vampirism in literature we may most fairly recall to mind the many academic and philosophical treatises upon the Vampire which were rehearsed and discussed in German Universities during the earlier part of the eighteenth century, and these startling themes soon began to attract the attention of poets and literary men. Thus among the poems of Heinrich August Ossenfelder we have a short piece entitled Der Vampir, which is as follows:
Mein liebes M√§gdchen glaubet
Best√§ndig steif und feste,
An die gegebnen Lehren
Der immer frommen Mutter
Als V√∂lker an der Theyse
An t√∂dtliche Vampiere
Heyduckisch feste glauben,
Nun warte nur Christianchen,
Du willst mich gar nich lieben;
Ich will mich an dir r√§chen,
Und heute in Tockayer
Zu einem Vampir trinken.
Und wenn du sanfte schlummerst,
Von deinen sch√∂nen Wangen
Den frischen Purpur saugen.
Alsdenn wirst du erschrecken,
Wenn ich dich werde k√ºssen
Und als ein Vampir k√ºssen:
Wann du dann recht erzitterst
Und matt in meine Arme,
Gleich einer Todten sinkest
Alsdenn will ich dich fragen,
Sind meine Lehren besser,
Als deiner guten Mutter?
The poet Wieland has a passing reference to the Vampire
Der J√ºngling aus den Wolken
Herab gefallen, stumm und bleich,
Als h√§tt' ein Vampyr ihm die Adern ausgemolken,
Steht ganz vernichtet von dem Streich.
It would be an exaggeration to say that the Vampire entered German literature with Goethe's famous ballad Die Braut von Korinth, but it would be difficult to over-estimate the influence and the popularity of this piece, the subject of which is directly derived from Phlegon of Tralles. The young Athenian who visits his father's old friend to whose daughter he has been betrothed receives at midnight the Vampire body of the girl whom death has prevented from becoming his bride, and who declares:
Aus dem Grabe werd' ich ausgetrieben,
Noch zu suchen das vermifste Gut,
Noch den schon verlornen Mann zu lieben Und zu saugen seines Herzens Blut.
Ist's um den geschehn,
Muss nach andern gehn,
Und das junge Volk erliegt der Wut.
Even more famous are the charnel horrors of B√ºrger's Lenore which was first printed in 1773 in the Gottinger Musenalmanach and which notwithstanding the legions of hostile comments and parodies whereof Brandl gives an ample list has remained a household word.
In spite of the immense enthusiasm at that date in contemporary England for German romantic literature it is remarkable that no translation of Lenore was published here until 1796, when William Taylor of Norwich printed in the Monthly Review of March his rendering which in some respects must be called an adaptation. He had, however, by his own account written the translation as early as 1790, and there can be no doubt that very shortly after its completion it was declaimed, applauded and much discussed in Norwich literary circles. We know that Mrs. Barbauld who visited Edinburgh ""about the summer of 1793 or 1794"" read aloud Taylor's version to a number of enthusiastic admirers. This event was described to Sir Walter Scott by Miss Cranstoun, afterwards Countess Purgstall, although Scott himself mentions that his curiosity ""was first attracted to this truly romantic story by a gentleman, who, having heard Lenore once read in manuscript, could only recollect the general outline, and part of a couplet, which, from the singularity of its structure, and frequent recurrence, had remained impressed on his memory."" This gentleman Was Mr. Cranstoun, the brother of Countess Purgstall, and so her statement is no doubt accurate as Scott might well have received his account both from the brother as well as from the sister. It was in the course of 1794, or at any rate early in the following year that Scott made his own rendering of the ballad. The account of Taylor's version, Ellenore, which ""electrified"" the assembled company at Dugald Stewart's house when read by the famous Anna Letitia Barbauld had given him the strongest desire to see the original. Just about this time, however, it was a difficult matter to procure books from the continent, and it was not until after some delay that a copy of B√ºrger's works was conveyed to him from Hamburg. He immediately devoured the German ballad and was so impressed that he forthwith set about Englishing it. ""I well recollect"" he writes, ""that I began my task after supper, and finished it about daybreak next morning."" Scott's friends privately printed a few copies of the poem as a surprise for the author,"" and as it went from hand to hand it met with the most flattering reception. In 1796, besides the public issue of the translations from B√ºrger by Taylor and by Scott, no less than three other versions appeared, from the several pens of W. R. Spencer, H. J. Pye and J. T. Stanley. The translation by the last named author was given to the public in an √©dition de luxe at five shillings, as well as in the ordinary edition of half a crown. In 1797, a pasquil followed, Miss Kitty: a Parody on Lenora, a Ballad, ""Translated from the German, by several Hands,"" whilst in the following year, Mrs. Taylor turned the popular poem into Italian as a ""Novella Morale."" Probably the most faithful, if not the most spirited translation, was that by the Rev. J. Beresford which was published in 1800.
It was in 1797 that Coleridge wrote the first part of Christabel, and German critics have somewhat superfluously endeavoured to emphasize herein the influence of Lenore, since upon examination it would hardly seem that such is present even in the smallest degree. For example, if the narrative of Geraldine be carefully read it must be evident that the following judgment of Professor Brandl is without foundation. This critic writes: ""Ihre Vorgeschichte (of Geraldine) sch√∂pfte er grossentheils aus B√ºrgers 'Lenore' in Taylors Uebersetzung: die Dame ist, wenigstens ihrer Erz√§hlung nach, auf einem windschnellen Ross entf√ºhrt und halbtodt vor Furcht hier abgesetzt worden; statt des schwarzen Leichenzuges, der Lenoren auf ihrem Ritt durch die Mondnacht aufstiess, will sie 'den Schatten der Nacht' gekreuzt haben; noch zittert das verdorrte Blatt neben ihr wie aus Herzenangst.""
As we might expect, the young Shelley was enchanted by Lenore, and Medwin relates how the poet long treasured cc a copy of the whole poem, which he made with his own hand."" Dowden tells the story how one Christmas Eve Shelley dramatically related the B√ºrger ballad with appropriate intonation and gesture ""working up the horror to such a height of fearful interest ""that the company fully expected to see Wilhelm stalk into the parlour."" In his study of Shelley, Charles Middleton has remarked: ""It is hinted, somewhat plausibly, that the Leonora of B√ºrgher first awakened his poetic faculty. A tale of such beauty and terror might well have kindled his lively imagination, but his earliest pieces, written about this time, and consisting only of a few ballads, are deficient in elegance and originality, and give no evidence whatever of the genius which soon after declared itself."" To suggest, as Zeiger would have it, that Lenore influenced the poem which in the romance St. Irvyne Megalina inscribes on the wall of her prison, and which commences:
Ghosts of the dead! have I not heard your yelling
Rise on the night-rolling breast of the blast, . . .
is the merest ineptitude, since these verses are taken almost word for word from ""Lachin y Gair"" in Byron's Hours of Idleness, and that had been published some four years previously.
As I have elsewhere shown in some detail, Shelley's two juvenile romances owe not only their inspiration but a great deal of their phrasing and noctivagations to Charlotte Dacre's Zofloya: or The Moor, which appeared in 1806, and which, as the poet himself declares ""quite enraptured"" him. It is a very remarkable circumstance that in spite of the extremely plain hint which might profitably have been taken from such poems as Die Braut von Korinth and Lenore the novelists of the Gothic school, soaked though they were in German literature, searching the earth and the depths of the earth for thrills and sensation of every kind, do not seem to have utilized the tradition of the Vampire. It is a puzzle indeed if we ask how it was that such writers as Monk Lewis, ""Apollo's sexton,"" who would fain ""make Parnassus a churchyard""; and Charles Robert Maturin who, as he himself confessed, loved bells rung by viewless hands, daggers encrusted with long shed blood, treacherous doors behind still more treacherous tapestry, mad nuns, apparitions, et hoc genus omne; the two lords of macabre romance, should neither of them have sent some hideous vampire ghost ravening through their sepulchral pages. In the Gothic romance we have horror heaped on horror's head; mouldering abbeys, haunted castles, banditti, illuminati, sorcerers, conspirators, murderous monks and phantom friars, apparitions without number until the despairing reviewers cried aloud: ""Surely the misses themselves must be tired of so many stories of ghosts and murders."" We have such titles as the famous Horrid Mysteries; The Midnight Groan; The Abbot of Montserrat, or, The Pool of Blood; The Demon of Venice; The Convent Spectre; The Hag of the Mountains; and a hundred such lurid nomenclatures, but until we come to Polidori's novel which will be considered later, nowhere, so far as I am aware, do we meet with the Vampire in the realm of Gothic fancy. So vast, however, is this fascinating library and so difficult to procure are these novels of a century and a quarter ago that I hesitate sweepingly to assert that this theme was entirely unexploited. There may be some romance which I have not had the good fortune to find where a hideous vampire swoops down upon his victims, but if such be the case I am at least prepared to say that the Vampire was not generally known to Gothic lore, and had his presence made itself felt in the sombre chapters of one votary of this school I think he would have re-appeared on many occasions, for the writers were as accustomed to convey from one another with an easy assurance, as they were wont deftly to plunder the foreign mines. Inevitably one of the band, T. J. Horseley Carties, Francis Lathom, William Herbert, Edward Montague, Mrs. Roche, Eliza Parsons, Miss M. Hamilton, Mrs. Helme, Mrs. Meeke, Isabella Kelley, and many another beside insatiably agog for horrid phantasmagoria would have utilized the Vampire in some funereal episode.
One might even have supposed that the notes to Southey's Thalaba the Destroyer, must have put them on the track, and surely stanzas eight, nine and ten in Book VIII could not have passed unnoticed:
A night of darkness and of storms!
Into the Chamber of the Tomb
Thalaba led the Old Man,
To roof him from the rain.
A night of storms! the wind
Swept through the moonless sky,
And moan'd among the pillar'd sepulchres;
And in the pauses if its sweep
They heard the heavy rain
Beat on the monument above.
In silence on Oneiza's grave
Her father and her husband sate.
The Cryer from the Minaret
Proclaim'd the midnight hour.
""Now, now!"" cried Thalaba;
And o'er the chamber of the tomb
There spread a lurid gleam,
Like the reflection of a sulphur fire
And in that hideous light
Oneiza stood before them. It was She . . .
Her very lineaments. . . . and such as death
Had changed them, livid cheeks and lips of blue;
But in her eye there dwelt
Brightness more terrible
Than all the loathsomeness of death.
""Still art thou living, wretch? ""
In hollow tones she cried to Thalaba;
""And must I nightly leave my grave
To tell thee, still in vain,
God hath abandoned thee?
""This is not she!"" the Old Man exclaim'd;
""A Fiend; a manifest Fiend!""
And to the youth he held his lance;
""Strike and deliver thyself!""
""Strike HER!"" cried Thalaba,
And palsied of all power,
Gazed fixedly upon the dreadful form.
""Yea, strike her!"" cried a voice, whose tones
Flow'd with such a sudden healing through his soul,
As when the desert shower
From death deliver'd him;
But obedient to that well-known voice,
His eye was seeking it,
When Moath, firm of heart,
Perform 'd the bidding: through the vampire corpse
He thrust his lance; it fell,
And howling with the wound,
Its fiendish tenant fled.
A sapphire light fell on them,
And garmented with glory, in their sight
Oneiza's spirit stood.
It is important to remark that in his notes upon this passage Southey cites at considerable length various cases of vampirism, particularly from the Lettres Juives, the Vampires of Gradisch, also the history of Arnold Paul, and the very ample account given by Tournefort. He further says: ""The Turks have an opinion that men that are buried have a sort of life in their graves. If any man makes affidavit before a judge, that he heard a noise in a man's grave, he  is, by order, dug up and chopped all too pieces. The merchants (at Constantinople) once airing on horseback, had, as usual, for protection, a Janisary with them. Passing by the burying place of the Jews, it happened that an old Jew sat by a sepulchre. The Janisary rode up to him, and rated him for stinking the world a second time, and commanded him to get into his grave again--Roger North's Life of Sir Dudley North.""
It might perhaps not unfairly be argued that the two notorious romances of the Marquis de Sade Justine, on les Malheurs de la Vertu and Juliette depict scenes of vampirism, and if we are to take the word in any extended sense this is certainly the case. In the first place it must be remembered that as it passed through various editions-it was first issued in 1791, 2 vols., 8vo,--until it appeared in its final and complete form in 1797 as La Nouvelle Justine, on les Malheurs de la Vertu, suivie de l'Histoire de Juliette, sa soeur, 10 vols., 18mo (of which Justine occupies four and Juliette six) Justine was added to and augmented until the last version is practically double the length of the first, and the book has been entirely re-written. In Justine we have the episodes in the house of Monsieur Rodin, and more particularly the orgies of the Comte de Gernade who takes a lustful pleasure in watching the blood flow from the veins of his victims, as also the cruelties of the monster Roland all of which. may well be esteemed vampirism. Many similar scenes are described with great prolixity in Juliette, and this romance is distinguished by such horrible figures as the Muscovite giant Minski, whose favourite meat is human flesh, and in whose castle the table and chairs are made of bleaching bones, and Cordelli, the necrophilist of Ancona.
In The New Monthly Magazine, 1 April, 1819, was published The Vampyre: a Tale by Lord Byron, which although it may seem to us--steeped in Le Fanu and M. R. James--a little old-fashioned, at the time created an immense sensation and had the most extraordinary influence, being even more admired and imitated on the Continent than in England. It was almost immediately known that actually the story did not come from the pen of Lord Byron, but had been written by Dr. John William Polidori, physician-companion to the poet. Byron had, as a matter of fact, been writing a work of the same title in imitation of Mrs. Shelley's Frankenstein, but he denied the authorship of this piece in the famous letter facsimilied in Galignani's edition of his works. A first printed, The Vampyre forms a part of extracts from ""A letter from Geneva, with Anecdotes of Lord Byron."" Here is to be read that ""among other things which the lady, from whom I procured these anecdotes, related to me, she mentioned the outline of a ghost story by Lord Byron. It appears that one evening Lord Byron, Mr. p. B. Shelley, the two ladies and the gentleman (the daughters of Godwin and Dr. Polidori) before alluded to after having perused a German work, which was entitled Phantasmagoriana began relating ghost stories; when his lordship having recited the beginning of Christabel, then unpublished, the whole took so strong a hold of Mr. Shelley's mind, that he suddenly started up and ran out of the room. The physician and Lord Byron followed, and discovered him leaning against a mantlepiece with cold drops of perspiration trickling down his face. After having given him something to refresh him, upon enquiring into the cause of his alarm, they found that his wild imagination having pictured to him the bosom of one of the ladies with eyes (which was reported of a lady in the neighbourhood where he lived) he was obliged to leave the room in order to destroy the impression. It was afterwards proposed in the course of conversation, that each of the company present should write a tale depending upon some supernatural agency, which was undertaken by Lord Byron, the physician, and Miss M. Godwin. My friend, the lady above referred to, had in her possession the outline of each of these stories, I obtained them as a great favour, and herewith forward them to you, as I was assured you would feel as much curiosity as myself, to peruse the √©bauches of so great a genius, and those immediately under his influence."" Upon this the Editor has the following note: ""We have in our possession the Tale of Dr. ------ as well as the outline of that of Miss Godwin. The latter has already appeared under the title of 'Frankenstein, or the modern Prometheus'; the former, however, upon consulting this author, we may, probably, hereafter give to our readers.""
The Vampyre is introduced by several paragraphs which deal with the tradition. This preamble commences: ""The superstition upon which this tale is founded is very general in the East. Among the Arabians it appears to be common; it did not, however, extend itself to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has only assumed its present form since the division of the Latin and Greek churches; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, that a Latin body could not corrupt if buried in their territory, it gradually increased, and formed the subject of many wonderful stories, still extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the blood of the young and beautiful. In the West it spread, with some slight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the belief existed, that vampyres nightly imbibed a certain portion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and speedily died of consumptions; whilst these human bloodsuckers fattened--and their veins became distended to such a state of repletion as to cause the blood to flow from all the passages of their bodies, and even from the very pores of their skins.""
The Editor then recounts the famous instance of Arnold Paul, and continues: ""We have related this monstrous rodomontade, because it seems better adapted to illustrate the subject of the present observations than any other instance we could adduce. In many parts of Greece it is considered as a sort of punishment after death, for some heinous crime committed whilst in existence, that the deceased is doomed to vampyrise, but be compelled to confine his visitations solely to those beings he loved most while on earth-those to whom he was bound by ties of kindred and affection. This supposition is, we imagine, alluded to in the following fearfully sublime and prophetic curse from the 'Giaour.'
But first on earth, as Vampyre sent,
Thy corse shall from its tomb be rent;
Then ghastly haunt thy native place,
And suck the blood of all thy race;
There from thy daughter, sister, wife, p. 283
At midnight drain the stream of life;
Yet loathe the banquet, which perforce
Must feed thy livid living corse,
Thy victims, ere they yet expire,
Shall know the demon for their sire;
As cursing thee, thou cursing them,
Thy flowers are withered on the stem.
But one that for thy crime must fall,
The youngest, best beloved of all,
Shall bless thee with a father's name--
That word shall wrap thy heart in flame!
Yet thou must end thy task and mark
Her check's last tinge--her eye's last spark,
And the last glassy glance must view
Which freezes o'er its lifeless blue;
Then with unhallowed hand shall tear
The tresses of her yellow hair,
Of which, in life a lock when shorn
Affection's fondest pledge was worn--
But now is borne away by thee
Memorial o thine agony!
Yet with thine own best blood shall drip
Thy gnashing tooth, and haggard lip;
Then stalking to thy sullen grave
Go--and with Ghouls and Afrits rave,
Till these in horror shrink away
From spectre more accursed than they.""
After an allusion to Southey's Thalaba, Tournefort's Travels, and Dom Calmet's classical work, the editor concludes: ""We could add many curious and interesting notices on this singularly horrible superstition, and we may, perhaps, resume our observations upon it at some future opportunity; for the present, we feel that we have very far exceeded the limits of a note, necessarily devoted to the explanation of the strange production to which we now invite the attention of our readers; and we shall therefore conclude by merely remarking, that though the term Vampyre is the one in most general acceptation, there are several other synonimous with it, which are made use of in various parts of the world, namely, Vroucolocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.""
The story tells how at the height of a London season there appeared at the various parties of the leaders of the ton a nobleman, more remarkable for his singularities, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he could not participate therein. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair only attracted his attention that he might by a look quell it, and throw fear into those breasts where thoughtlessness reigned. Those who felt this sensation of awe, could not explain whence it arose; some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which fixing upon the object's face, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glance to pierce through to the inward working of the heart; but fell upon the cheek with a leaden ray that weighed upon the skin it could not pass."" This original is invited to every house, and in the course of the winter he meets ""a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey"" he was an orphan left with an only sister in the possession of great wealth, by parents who died while he was yet in childhood."" Aubrey is greatly fascinated by Lord Ruthven, for this is the name of the mysterious nobleman, and intending to travel upon the Continent he mentions this intention to my Lord, and is ""surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattered by such a mark of esteem from him who, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circling waters.""
As they travelled from town to town, Aubrey notices the peculiar conduct of his companion who bestows largess upon the most worthless characters, broken gamblers and the like, but refuses a doit to the deserving and virtuous poor. However the recipients of this charity ""inevitably found that there was a curse upon it, for they all were either led to the scaffold or sunk to the lowest and the most abject misery."" Eventually the travellers arrive at Rome, and here Aubrey receives letters from his guardians who require him immediately to leave his companion as since their departure from London the most terrible scandals, adulteries and seductions, have come to light. At Rome Aubrey is able to foil Lord Ruthven's plans, frustrating an intrigue designed to ruin a heedless young girl, and then he ""directed his steps towards Greece, and, crossing the Peninsula, soon found himself at Athens."" Here he lodges in the house of a Greek, whose daughter Ianthe is a paragon of the most exquisite beauty. As he sketches the ruins of the city she is wont to entertain him with Greek legend and tradition, and ""often, as she told him the tale of the living vampyre, who had passed years amidst his friends, and dearest ties, forced every year, by feeding upon the life of a lovely female to prolong his existence for the ensuing months, his blood would run cold, whilst he attempted to laugh her out of such idle and horrible fantasies; but Ianthe cited to him the names of old men, who had at last detected one living among themselves, after several of their relatives and children had been found marked with the stamp of the fiend's appetite; and when she found him so incredulous, she begged of him to believe her, for it had been remarked, that those who had dared to question their existence, always had some proof given, which obliged them, with grief and heart-breaking to confess it was true. She detailed to him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and his horror was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate description of Lord Ruthven; he, however, still persisted in persuading her, that there could be no truth in her fears, though at the same time he wondered at the many coincidences which had all tended to excite a belief in the supernatural power of Lord Ruthven.""
Before long it becomes evident that Aubrey is in love with Ianthe, ""and while he ridicules the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, still he found himself more and more attached to the almost fairy form before him."" He endeavours to occupy his time with antiquarian excursions which lead him farther and farther afield, and at length he determines to proceed to a point beyond any he has as yet visited. When Ianthe's parents hear the name of the place he proposes to visit they most earnestly implore him on no account to return when once dusk has fallen, ""as he must necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever remain after the day had closed, upon any consideration. They described it as the resort of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced the most heavy evils as impending upon him who dared to cross their path. Aubrey made light of their representations, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring thus to mock a superior, the very name of which apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent.""
Having given his promise to Ianthe that he will be back well before evening he sets out very early. The exploration, however, takes longer than he has supposed, and when he turns his horse homeward the darkness is already hurrying on urged by a terrific storm. The steed, alarmed at the battle of the elements dashes off at breakneck pace and only halts trembling and t",en,LABEL_0,0.5420039892196655,LABEL_1,0.4579960107803345

Night give us hopes of meeting a stranger that could; with these, the
Wine we had drank, and our ignorance of the place, even in the day
Time, conspir'd to mis-direct us. When we had wander'd almost an
Hour, with our feet all bloody, over sharp pebbles and broken hills of
Gravel, Gito's diligence at last deliver'd us: for the day before
Fearing we might be at a loss, tho' we had the sun to our help, he had
Providently mark'd every post and pillar with a chalk, the greatest
Darkness was not able to obscure, by whose shineing whiteness we found
Our way. But we had as many fears after we got to an inn; for the
Hostess, having drank a little too long with her guests, had so
Intirely lost her senses, a burning could not have made her feel; that
Perhaps, we had been forc'd to have taken up our lodging in the
Street, if a letter-carrier that belong'd to Trimalchio, with ten
Carriages of his master's revenue, had not come in the mean time; who
Without much ado beat down the door, and let us in at the same gap
After we enter'd the bed-chamber, having plentifully feasted; prest by
Impatient nature, I took my Gito aside; and wrapt in pleasures, spent
The night
Who can the charms of that blest night declare
How soft ye gods! our warm embraces were?
We hugg'd, we cling'd, and thro' each other's lips
Our souls, like meeting streams, together mixt;
Farewell the world, and all its pageantry!
When I, a mortal! so begin to dye
'Tis without reason I hug myself; Ascyltos, omnis iniuriae inventor
Subduxit mihi nocte puerum et in lectum transtulit suum, volutatusque
Liberius cum fratre non suo, sive non sentiente iniuriam sive
Dissimulante, indormivit alienis amplexibus oblitus iuris humani
Itaque ego ut experrectus pertrectavi gaudio despoliatum torum. Si
Qua est amantibus fides, ego dubitavi, an utrumque traicerem gladio
Somnumque morti iungerem. Tutius dein secutus consilium Gitona quidem
Verberibus excitavi, and looking as sternly as I cou'd upon Ascyltos
Thus address'd my self: ""Since you've play'd the villain by your
Treachery, and breaking the common laws of friendship, pack up your
Matters quickly, and find another comrade to abuse.""
Ascyltos consented; and, after we had made an exact division of our
Booty; ""Now,"" says he, ""let's share the boy too"": I believ'd it a jest
At parting, but, he with a murderous resolution, drew his sword; ""nor
Shall you,"" added he, ""think to ingross this prize, which should, like
The rest, be common to us both. I must have my share, or with this
Sword will be content to take it."" Upon which, on the other side
Having twisted my gown under my arm, I made advances to ingage
The unhappy boy rush'd between, and kissing both our knees, with
Tears, entreated that we would not expose our selves in a pitiful
Alehouse, nor with our blood pollute the rites of so dear a
Friendship: but, raising his voice, says he, ""if there must be murder
Behold my naked bosom, hither direct your fury: 'Tis I deserve death
Who violated the sacred laws of friendship.""
Upon which we sheath'd our swords; and first Ascyltos, ""I'll,"" says
He, ""end the difference: Let the boy himself follow the man he likes
That, in chusing a friend, at least, he may have an unquestion'd
Liberty.""
I, that presum'd so long an acquaintance, had made no slight
Impressions on his nature, was so far from fearing, that with an eager
Haste I accepted the proffer, and to the judge committed the dispute:
Gito, that he might not seem to consider, at my consent jump'd up, and
Chose Ascyltos
I, like one thunderstruck, at the sentence, void of defence, fell upon
The bed, and had not surviv'd the loss, if envy of my rival had not
Stopp'd my sword
Ascyltos, proud of the conquest, goes off with the prize, leaving me
Expos'd in a strange place, that before he caress'd as a friend and
Sharer of his fortune:
'Tis in the world, as in a game of chess;
We serve our friends but where our profit is
When fortune smiles, we're yours, and yours alone;
But when she frowns, the servile herd are gone
So, in a play, they act with mimick art
Father, or son, or griping miser's part:
But when at last the comic scenes are o'er
They quit the visards they assum'd before
Nor did I there very long complain, for fearing one Menelaus, an usher
Of a school, might, among other misfortunes, find me alone in the inn
I made up my wallet, and, very pensive, took me a lodging in a private
Place near the sea: there, after I had been mewd up for three days
Reflecting afresh on my despis'd and abject condition, I beat my
Breast, as sick as it was; and, when my deep sighs would suffer me
Often cry'd out; ""Why has not the earth burst open, and swallow'd me?
Why has not the sea o'erwhelm'd me that respects not even the innocent
Themselves? Have I been a murderer? when I had violated Lycas's wife
Have I fled justice? have I escap'd even when I was condemn'd to dye
To live in a strange place, to have my name recorded only among
Beggars and vagabonds? and who condemn'd me to this solitude?--A boy!
One who is a prostitute to all manner of lust; and by his own
Confession deserves to dye; whom vice has enobl'd from a slave; who
Was publickly contracted with as a girl, by one that knew he was of
The other sex: and what a wretch is that other, ye gods! whom, when he
Might have writ man, his mother perswaded even out of his sex, and
Putting on petty-coats, was condemn'd to a maids office in a prison:
Who, after he had spent what he had, and chang'd the scene of his
Lust; having contracted an old friendship, basely left it; and
Frontless impudence! like a hot whore, for one night's pleasure, sold
His friend. Now the lovers lye whole nights lockt in each other's
Arms, and who knows but in those intervals they recruit their weary'd
Strength, may laugh at me: but they shan't go off so, for if I'm a
Man, or a free-born one at least, I'll make their blood compensate the
Injury.""
Having thus said I girt on my sword; and lest I shou'd be too weak to
Maintain the war, encourag'd my self with a lusty meal, and making out
Of doors, like one possesst, search'd every place: but whilst, with a
Wild distracted countenance, I thought of nothing but blood and
Slaughter; and oft with execrations laying my hand on my sword, a
Souldier, perhaps some cheat or padder, observ'd me, and making up to
Me, askt to what regiment or company I, his brother souldier
Belong'd? when, with a good assurance, I had cheated him into a belief
Of the regiment and company; well, but friend, said he, looking down
Doe the souldiers of your company walk in such shoes? I began to look
Guilty, and by my trembling discover'd the lye I had told him: upon
Which he made me lay down my arms, and bid me take care of the worst
Thus stript, nay and thus rob'd of my revenge, I return'd to my
Lodging, where by degrees my fears abating, I began in my mind to
Thank the robber
But finding it difficult to wean my self from the love of revenge, I
Spent half the night very pensively; and rising by day-break, to ease
Me of my grief, and thoughts of my injury, I rov'd about every where
Till at last going in to a publick gallery, very wonderful for several
Sorts of excellent painting; I saw some by Zeuxy's hand, that had not
Yet yielded to the injuries of time: And, not without an awful
Reverence, behold others by Protogenes, which tho' they were first
Tryals, yet disputed for exactness, even with nature it self: but on
The other side viewing a celebrated piece drawn by Apelles; I even
Ador'd the work of so great a master: 'twas so correctly finisht to
The life, you'd have sworn it an image of the soul too. One side gave
The story of the eagle bearing Jupiter to heaven, the other the fair
Hylas repelling the addresses of the lew'd naiad: in another part was
Apollo, angry at himself for killing his boy Hyacinth; and, to shew
His love, crown'd his harp with the flower that sprung from his blood
In this gallery, as in a vision of living images, I cry'd out; and are
Not the gods themselves secure from love? Jupiter in his seraglio
Above, not finding one that can please his appetite, sins upon earth
Yet injures nobody: the nymph wou'd have stifl'd her passion for
Hylas, had she believ'd the lusty Hercules wou'd have been his rival:
Apollo turns Hyacinth into a flower: and every image enjoy'd its
Wishes without a rival: but I have caress'd, as the dearest friend
The greatest villain
While I was thus talking to my self, there enter'd the gallery an old
Man, with a face as pale as age had made his hair; and seem'd, I know
Not how, to bring with him the air of a great soul; but viewing his
Habit, I was easily confirm'd in my opinion, since fortune seldom
Deals favourably with learned men. In short, he made up to me, and
Addressing himself, told me he was a poet; and, as he hop'd, above the
Common herd: if, added he, my merrit don't suffer by applause that's
Promiscuously given, to the good and bad
Why, therefore, interrupted I, are you so meanly clad? On this
Account return'd he, because learning never made any man rich
The merchant's profit well rewards his toil:
The souldier crowns his labours with the spoil:
To servile flattery we altars raise:
And the kind wife her stallion ever pays:
But starving wit in rags takes barren pain:
And, dying, seeks the muses aid in vain
""'Tis certain,"" added he, ""that a lover of virtue, on account of his
Singularity, meets with contempt; for who can approve what differs
From himself? And that those who admire riches, wou'd fain possess
Every body, that nothing is more reasonable than their opinion; whence
They ridicule, as well as they can, the learned few; that they, like
Themselves, might seem within the power of money.""
""I don't know, how learning and poverty became relations,"" said I, and
Sigh'd: ""You justly lament,"" return'd he, ""the condition of scholars.""
""You mistake me,"" said I, ""that's not the occasion of my sighs
There's another and much greater cause:"" And, as all men are naturally
Inclin'd to communicate their grief; I laid open my case to him
Beginning with Ascyltos's treachery, which I aggravated; and, with
Repeated sighs, often wisht his injustice to me might have deserv'd
Pardon: but that now he was a staunch villain, and in lust more subtle
Than the bawds themselves
The old man, seeing me sincere, began to comfort me; and the better to
Effect it, told me what formerly had happen'd to himself on the like

""In Asiam cum a quaestore essem stipendio eductus, hospitium Pergami
Accepi. Ubi cum libenter habitarem non solum propter cultum
Aedicularum, sed etiam propter hospitis formosissimum filium
Excogitavi rationem, qua non essem patri familiae suspectus amator
Quotiescunque enim in convivio de usu formosorum mentio facta est, tam
Vehementer excandui, tam severa tristitia violari aures meas obsceno
Sermone nolui, ut me mater praecipue tanquam unum ex philosophis
Intueretur. Iam ego coeperam ephebum in gymnasium deducere, ego
Studia eius ordinare, ego docere ac praecipere, ne quis praedator
Corporis admitteretur in domum. . .
""Forte cum in triclinio iaceremus, quia dies sollemnis ludum artaverat
Pigritiamque recedendi imposuerat hilaritas longior, fere circa mediam
Noctem intellexi puerum vigilare. Itaque timidissimo murmure votum
Feci et 'domina' inquam 'Venus, si ego hunc puerum basiavero, ita ut
Ille non sensiat, cras illi par columbarum donabo.' Audito voluptatis
Pretio puer stertere coepit. Itaque aggressus simulantem aliquot
Basiolis invasi. Contentus hoc principio bene mane surrexi electumque
Par columbarum attuli expectanti ac me voto exsolvi
""Proxima nocte cum idem liceret, mutavi optionem et 'si hunc' inquam
'tractavero improba manu, et ille non senserit, gallos gallinaceos
Pugnacissimos duos donabo patienti.' Ad hoc votum ephebus ultro se
Admovit et, puto, vereri coepit, ne ego obdormiscerem. Indulsi ergo
Sollicito, totoque corpore citra summam voluptatem nne ingurgitavi
Deinde ut dies venit, attuli gaudenti quicquid promiseram. Ut tertia
Nox licentiam dedit, consurrexi . . . ad aurem male dormientis 'dii'
Inquam 'immortales, si ego huic dormienti abstulero coitum plenum et
Optabilem, pro hac felicitate cras puero asturconem. Macedonicum
Optimum donabo, cum hac tamen exceptione, si ille non senserit.'
Nunquam altiore somno ephebus obdormivit. Itaque primum implevi
Lacentibus papillis manus, mox basio inhaesi, deinde in unum omnia
Vota coniunxi. Mane sedere in cubiculo coepit atque expectare
Consuetudinem meam. Scis quanto facilius sit, columbas gallosque
Gallinaceos emere quam asturconem, et praeter hoc etiam timebam, ne
Tam grande munus suspectam faceret humanitatem meam. Ego aliquot
Horis spatiatus in hospitium reverti nihilque aliud quam puerum
Basiavi. At ille circumspiciens ut cervicem meam iunxit amplexu
'rogo' inquit 'domine, ubi est asturco?'
""Cum ob hanc offensam praeclusissem mihi aditum, quem feceram, iterum
Ad licentiam redii. Interpositis enim paucis diebus, cum similis
Casus nos in eandem fortunam rettulisset, ut intellexi stertere
Patrem, rogare coepi ephebum, ut reverteretur in gratiam mecum, id est
Ut pateretur satis fieri sibi, et cetera quae libido distenta dictat
At ille plane iratus nihil aliud dicebat nisi hoc: 'aut dormi, aut ego
Iam dicam patri.' Nihil est tam arduum, quod non improbitas
Extorqueat. Dum dicit: 'patrem excitabo,' irrepsi tamen et male
Repugnanti gaudium extorsi. At ille non indelectatus nequitia mea
Postquam diu questus est deceptum se et derisum traductumque inter
Condiscipulos, quibus iactasset censum meum, 'videris tamen' inquit
'non ero tui similis. Si quid vis, fac iterum.' Ego vero deposita
Omni offensa cum puero in gratiam redii ususque beneficio eius in
Somnum delapsus sum. Sed non fuit contentus iteratione ephebus planae
Maturitatis et annis ad patiendum gestientibus. Itaque excitavit me
Sopitum et 'numquid vis?' inquit. Et non plane iam molestum erat
Munus. Utcunque igitur inter anhelitus sudoresque tritus, quod
Voluerat, accepit, rursusque in somnum decidi gaudio lassus
Interposita minus hora pungere me manu coepit et dicere: 'quare non
Facimus?' tum ego totiens excitatus plane vehementer excandui et
Reddidi illi voces suas: 'aut dormi, aut ego iam patri dicam.'""
This discourse diverting my grief, I began to question the old
Gentleman about the antiquity of some pieces, the stories of others I
Was not acquainted with, the reason why this age don't come up to the
Former, and why the most excellent arts are lost, of which painting
Has not left the least sign of its being? ""Our love of riches,""
Reply'd he, ""has been the only occasion: for in old time, when virtue
Was admir'd for its own sake, all liberal arts flourisht, and the only
Emulation among men, was to make discoveries that might profit the
Age. 'Twas in those times Democritus, content with poverty, found out
The vertue of most herbs; and lest there might be any hidden
Excellence in stones and trees, spent the rest of his life in
Experiments about them: 'Twas then Eudoxus abandon'd the world, to
Live on the top of a high mountain, to discover the motions of the
Heavens and Crisippus, the better to qualify his mind for invention
Went thrice through a course of physick
""But to return to imagery, Lysippus with that diligence imploy'd
Himself about one statue, that, neglecting his living, he dyed, for
Want: and Myron, whose brazen images of men and beasts, you might have
Mistaken for living ones, dy'd very poor: but our age is so wholly
Devoted to drinking and whoring, we're so far from inventing, that we
Don't acquaint our selves even with those arts that are found to our
Hands: But, accusing antiquity, our schools become seminaries of vice
Only: what's our logick? How little do we know of astronomy? Where's
Our philosopher? What master of eloquence could indure to hear it so
Murdred in a pulpit? What wise man cou'd suffer the noise? Our
Business in the temple is not to inform our minds, or correct our
Lives; but as soon as we enter the place, one out of love to his
Friend, being made his heir, promises a sacrifice to the gods, if
They'd please to take him out of this troublesome world; another, if
They'd direct him to a treasure: the like a third promises if they'd
Make him happy in a small estate of 300l. per an. or so: The very
Senate that shou'd show an exemplary conduct, in occasions of doubtful
Events, have devoted mighty sums of gold to religious uses: And who
Wou'd not but admire, that, he is perswaded hath charms enough to make
The gods themselves comply! You need not wonder why painting is lost
When gold appears more beautiful both to gods and men, than any thing
Apelles or Phidias are now esteem'd madly to have spent their time
About: But seeing your curiosity is wholly taken up with that piece
That shews you a contracted history of the Siege of Troy: I'll try to
Give you the story more at large in verse
""Now Troy had felt a siege of ten long years
Concern and sorrow in each face appears:
The Grecian prophet too, with terrour fill'd
What fate decree'd, but doubtfully reveal'd:
When thus Apollo----
From the proud top of Ida's rising hill
A lofty pile of mighty cedars fell
Whose trunks into a dreadful fabrick force
And, let it bear the figure of a horse:
The spacious hollows, of whose mountain-womb
The choice and flower of your troops entomb
The Greeks, enrag'd to be so long repell'd
With their chief troops the beasts vast bowel's fill'd
And thus their arms and all their hopes conceal'd
Strange was the fate the rul'd unhappy Troy
Who thought them gone, and lasting peace t'enjoy
So the inscription of the machine said
And treacherous Synon, for their ruin made
All from their arms at once, and troubles run
To view the horse, and left th' unguarded town
So over-joy'd they wept: Thus even fears
When joy surprizes, melt away in tears
Enrag'd Laocoon, with prophetick beat
Prest thro' the crowd, that on his humour wait;
And with a javelin pierc'd the fatal horse
But fate retards the blow, and stopt its force:
The spear jumpt back upon the priest, so nigh
It gave new credit to the treachery
Yet to confirm how weak was the attempt
'Gainst what the gods will have, his javelin sent
Resum'd with double fury, thro' his side
And the large concave of the machine try'd:
When from within the captive Grecians roar;
And the beast trembles with another's fear
Yet to the town the present they convey
Thus a new stragem does Troy betray;
While to the taken, she becomes a prey
But other monsters there enform our eyes
What mighty seas from Teuedos arise!
The frighted Neptune seems to seek the shore
With such a noise, with such a dreadful roar:
As in a silent night, when, from afar
The dismal sound of wrecks invades the ear:
When rolling on the waves two mighty snakes
Unhappy Troy descry'd; whose circling stroaks
Had drove the swelling surges on the rocks
Like lofty ships they on the billows ride
And with rais'd breasts the foaming flood divide:
Their crests they brandish and red eye-balls raise
That all around dispence a sulphurous blaze
To shore advancing, now the waves appear
All fire; unwonted ratlings fill the air
The ocean trembles at their dreadful hiss;
All are amaz'd: When in a Trojan dress;
And holy wreaths their sacred temples bind
Laocoon's sons were by the snakes entwin'd:
Now t'wards heaven their little hands are thrown
Each for his brother, not himself does moan
And prays to save his ruin by his own
Both dye at last, thro' fear each other shou'd
And to give death a greater pomp, the good
Laocoon to their rescue vainly run
Now gorg'd with death, they drag him on the ground
Up to the altar, where devoted lies
The priest himself, a panting sacrifice
Thus with his blood the temple they prophane;
Losing their gods; Troy's ruin thus began:
Now the bright taper of the night appears
Gayly attended with a train of stars:
When midst the Trojans, dead in sleep and wine
The Grecians execute their dire design:
When from the open'd caverns of the horse
Like a large flood, their hidden troops did gush;
And now deliver'd, leave their horse and fear
With the same wanton motions colts appear:
When from the plow, and heavy collar freed
They shake their rising crests, and try their speed
Their swords they brandish, and their shields they rear
And fix their helmets, then begin the war:
A party here o' th' drunken Trojans light
And send them snoring to eternal night;
Another there now made their altars smoke
And against Troy, Troy's guardian gods invoke.""
When Eumolpus had gone thus far in his story, the people that were
Walking there, began to fling stones at him: But he, conscious of his
Merit, cover'd his head, and took up his heels: I, fearing they wou'd
Have taken me for a poet too, made after him: When we were out of
Stone shot of the enemy, ""I beseech you, sir,"" said I, ""what will you
Do with this disease of yours? I don't wonder at the peoples humour
Since I have hardly been acquainted with you two hours, and your
Entertainment has been more poetry than the conversation of a man. I
Think I must fill my pocket with stones, that when I perceive you
Going into a fit, I may bleed you in the head for it, with one of
'em.""
He turn'd to me, and, ""Dear child,"" said he, ""I rose to day without
Consulting my fortune; tho' 'tis confest I seldom appear even on the
Stage, but such a mobb as this are laughing at me: But that I may not
Be at difference with you too, I'll tye my self up from this humour of
Poetry:"" ""Well, well,"" said I, ""on that condition I sup with you;""
Upon which, going into the poor cottage I lodg'd at, we order'd the
Master of it to get us a supper, and in the mean time we went to the
Bagnio, where I saw Gito standing against the wall, with towels and
Rubbing brushes in his hand; his troubl'd countenance easily perswaded
Me he serv'd on compulsion: As soon as he saw me, with joy addressing
Himself, he told me, that since I was not in that martial posture that
Once frighted him to belye his affections, he cou'd freely speak to
Me, upon which he entreated me to pity his circumstances; and, if I
Cou'd but deliver him from so barbarous a master, since he was now
Sorry he was forc'd to be my judge, I might take my satisfaction in
Any punishment I'de please to inflict; ""for,"" added he, ""if I must
Dye, 'twill be comfort enough to so unhappy a wretch to think that you
Are pleas'd in 't.""
I desir'd him wave his complaints, lest our design shou'd be
Discover'd, and leaving Eumolpus (for in the bath he was versifying)
We made off thro' a dirty back-entry, as privately as we could to my
Lodgings: Where, shutting the door, I threw my arms about his neck
And, tho, he was all in tears, half smother'd him with kisses: Thus we
Continu'd without a word from either side: Gito's repeated sobs so
Disturb'd him, he could not speak: When after a long time spent in
That posture, ""how unaccountable is it,"" began I, ""to love him that
Once forsook me! And that in this breast I shou'd feel so great a
Wound, yet have no sign of its being there! what's you' pretence for
Chusing Ascyltos? Have I deserv'd such usage?""
After he found I still had love for him, he began to look less
Concerned: ""When,"" added I, ""I'm so far from desireing an umpire to
Judge of th' ingratitude of your choice, that I neither complain of
Or design to remember it; if I find you sincere.""
I cou'd not tell him this without a tear: When, wiping his face, says
He, ""Encolpius, I appeal to your memory, whether I left, you, or you
Betray'd me. I must confess, and hope you can't blame me; when I saw
Two at daggers-drawing, that I ran to the strongest.""
I cou'd not but admire his wit, and to convince him of a perfect
Reconciliation, sealed it with repeated kisses
'Twas now quite dark, and our supper was dishing up, when Eumolpus
Knock'd at the door: I ask'd how many there was of 'em: And took an
Opportunity through a chink, to see whether Ascyltos was with him: But
Finding him alone, I soon open'd the door: He had hardly fixt himself
On his couch, when seeing Gito in waiting, ""on my word,"" said he, ""a
Very Gannymed; sure Encolpius, you'll have no reason to complain to
Day.""
I did not like to observing an entry; and was afraid I had entertain'd
Another Ascyltos. Eumolpus pursuing his humour, when the boy fill'd
Him a glass, ""I had rather,"" said he, ""be in possession of thee, than
The whole bagnio""; and greedily drinking it off, ""the heat I've been
In,"" added he, ""made this the pleasantest draught I ever took: For to
Deal freely with ye, I narrowly scap'd a beating, for attempting, when
I was in the bath, to deliver my thoughts of it in verse: And after I
Was turn'd out of the bagnio, as I us'd to be out of the theatre; I
Search'd every place, crying as loud as I cou'd, 'Encolpius
Encolpius.' A naked youth that had lost his cloaths, as strongly
Echo'd back to me, 'Gito, Gito': The boys, believing me mad, ridicul'd
Me with their mimikry: But the other was attended with a great
Concourse of people, that with an awful admiration prais'd the youth:
For nature had so largely qualify'd him for a lover, his body seem'd
But as the skirt of the mighty member it bore: A lusty rogue! I'll
Warrant, he'd maintain the field four and twenty hours! He therefore
Soon found relief, for some debauch'd spark, a Roman knight, as was
Reported, flung his cloak over him, and took him home, with hopes, I
Presume to engross so great a prize: But I was so far from meeting
Such civility, that even my own cloaths were kept from me, till I
Brought one that knew me, to satisfie 'em in my character: So much
More profitable 'tis to improve the body than the mind.""
Whilst Eumolpus was telling his story, I often chang'd countenance:
Looking glad at the ill fortune of my rival, but troubled at his good:
Yet did not interrupt him, lest he shou'd discover my concern: and
When he had done, I told him what we had for supper
I had hardly given him an account, e're our entertainment came in:
'Twas common homely food, but very nourishing: Our half starv'd doctor
Attacqu'd it very briskly, but when he had well fill'd himself, began
To tell us, philosophers were above the world, and to ridicule those
That condemn every thing, because 'tis common, and only to admire
Those things that are difficult to be had: ""These vicious appetites,""
Added he, ""that despise what they can cheaply come by, never taste any
Thing pure, but, like sick men, love only those things that are
Hurtful to 'em
""What's soon obtain'd, we nauseously receive
All hate the victory that's got with leave:
We scorn the good our happy isle brings forth
But love whatever is of foreign growth:
Not that the fish that distant waters feed
Do those excel that in our climate breed;
But these are cheaply taken, those came far
With difficulty got, and cost us dear:
Thus the kind she, abroad, we admire above
Th' insipid lump, at home of lawful love:
Yet once enjoy'd, we strait a new desire
And absent pleasures only do admire.""
""Is this,"" said I, interrupting him, ""what you promis'd, that you
Wou'd not versifie to day agen? I beseech you, sir, at least spare us
That never pelted you: For if any of the inn shou'd find we have a
Poet in our company, the whole neighbourhood wou'd be rais'd, and we
Shou'd dye martyrs for a wrong opinion: If nothing else will make you
Pity us, think of the galery and bath you came from"": when I had
Treated him after this rate, the good natur'd Gito, correcting me
Said, I did very ill to rail at a man so much my elder; and that
Having offer'd a gentleman the curtsie of my table, I shou'd not so
Far forget good breeding, to affront him when he came: With many the
Like expressions, attended with a blush at their delivery, that
Extreamly became him
""Happy the woman,"" said Eumolpus, ""that's blest with such a son!
Heaven encrease your virtue: so much sense, and so much beauty we
Seldom meet with in any one person: But, lest you shou'd think your
Civility thrown away, you have found a lover for it: I'll give the
World your praises in verse: I'll be your servant, your gardian, and
Will follow you every where: Nor can Encolpius think himself injur'd
He loves another.""
Eumolpus was oblig'd to the souldier that robb'd me of my sword, else
I had turn'd the fury upon him I meant for Ascyltos: Gito reading it
In my countenance, under pretence of fetching water, prudently
Withdrew: And allay'd my heat, by removing one cause of it: But my
Rage reviving, ""Eumolpus,"" said I, ""I had rather have heard even your
Verses, that you propose to your self such hopes: I am very
Passionate, and you are very lustful: Consider how improbable 'tis we
Shou'd agree; believe therefore I am mad, and humour the phrenzy; that
Is, be gone immediately.""
At this Eumolpus was in great confusion, and, without asking the
Occasion of my passion, presently made out: But drawing the door after
Him, what I did not in the least suspect, he lock'd me in, and
Stealing the key out of the door, ran in pursuit of Gito
The rage I was in to be so abus'd, put me upon hanging my self; and
Having ty'd an apron, I found in the room, to the bed-stead, committed
My neck to the noose I had made with its strings: When Eumolpus and
Gito came to the door, and entering, prevented my design: Gito, his
Grief growing to a rage, made a great out-cry, and forcing me on the
Bed, ""You're mistaken,"" said he, ""Encolpius, if you fancy it possible
For you to dye before me: I was first in the design, and had not
Surviv'd my choice of Ascyltos; if I had met with an instrument of
Death: But had not you come to my relief in the bath, I had resolv'd
To throw my self out of the window: And that you may know how ready
Death is to wait those that desire it: see--I've got what you so
Lately endeavour'd.""
Upon which, having snatch'd a rasor from Eumolpus's servant, he struck
Three or four times 't his throat, and fell down before us: frightened
At the accident, I cry'd out, and falling upon him e're he had reached
The ground, with the same weapon, endeavoured to follow him: But
Neither had Gito any appearance of a wound, nor did I feel my self
Hurt: For it happen'd to be a dull rasor, design'dly made so, to
Prepare learners of the art to handle a sharper which was the reason
Eumolpus did not offer to prevent our mimick deaths, nor his man look
Concern'd when the rasor was snatch'd from him
While this scene was acting, the inn-keeper came in upon us, with the
Other part of our supper; and viewing the obscene posture we were in
""I beseech you, sirs,"" said he, ""are ye drunk, or have fled justice
And are acting it on your selves, or both? ho! who was going to make a
Gibet of the bed? What private designs are here on foot? What--was
Your going out but now with intent to bilke me? But you shall feel
Fo't: I'll soon make ye know who rules here.""
""What, you rascal,"" crys Eumolpus, ""do you threat too?"" And without
More ado flung his fist in his face: The inn-keeper took up an earthen
Pitcher we so oft had empty'd, and sending it at Eumolpus, broke his
Forehead, and immediately ran down stairs: Eumolpus, impatient of
Revenge, snatching up a great wooden candlestick, made after him; and
Pouring his blows very thick on the inn-keeper, repair'd the injury
With interest: This alarm'd the whole house, and whilst the rest of
His guess, that by this time were most of 'em drunk; ran to see what
Was the matter, taking an opportunity to revenge the injury Eumolpus
Had offer'd me, I lock'd him out; and turning thus his trick upon
Himself, at once, enjoy'd the bed and board without a rival
In the mean time, the islanders (that came in at the bustle) and cooks
With all their kitchin artillery set upon Eumolpus: One throws at his
Head a hot spit with the meat on't; another with a pitchfork puts
Himself in a martial posture against him; but especially a blear-ey'd
Old woman, who tucking up the dirty apron she had about her, with one
Shoe on, and another off, hall'd a great mastiff and set him at
Eumolpus: But with the wooden candlestick he defended himself against
All his enemies
We saw all through a hole they had made by wrenching the latch from
The door: I wish'd him well you may imagine; but Gito had compassion
And wou'd have succour'd the distrest Eumolpus; upon which, my rage
Continuing, I gave his pitying head two or three blows with my fist;
He sate down on the bed and cry'd: but I so eagerly ply'd the hole, I
Made my eyes relieve each other; and, encouraging the people against
Him, with great satisfaction beheld the conflict: when the bailiff of
The island, one Bargates, whom the scuffle had rais'd from supper; was
Brought into the room, supported by others legs, for he was troubl'd
With the gout, he cou'd not use his own: And having in his clownish

If the sun is blazing
I turn into a raisin
I'm bringing this whole craze
For almost two whole days
I don't think that's possible
I don't think that's wise
I don't think that's probable
That is what they say when they look in to my eyes
My momma was afraid for me
She busted in like the ma√Ætre d
She said ""Hello umm""
I don't think you wanna sit here
I don't think you wanna get here
'Cause you might die
You know but then I was like ""I gotta try""
I gotta try to do the right thing
Shoutout to Spike Lee
I'm gonna try to get the ring
Try to get the bling
Try to be the king of the long raps
Like I was the dude with the ass raps
Doesn't matter
As long as the people fuckin' clap
As long as we give a little joy
Give em dat'
Then I will cut the crap
I guess I am a believer
And I don't care that I got seizures
I got my fuckin' pills
I'm gonna take 'em right around midnight
So I can get right
I think that's what I gotta do
Shout out to the medical commun-
Itty I just get gritty
I hope my rhymes are not shitty
Umm, mic check are you with me?
Shout-out Bobby and Whitney
But not shout out to the bad things he did
I don't know if I'm gonna have a kid
I don't know if I'm gonna raise a child
But it might be fun they'd be fuckin' wild
They would make be fuckin' smile
They got fuckin' bile and some guts
Everybody does
Everybody got guts
Everybody got nuts
Or half the people maybe like 48.7%
That's about how it went
I think that is the percentage-ish
Of the gender fuckin' separation
Although we know in this nation
Things are fuckin' changin' and you gotta be patient
If you don't understand
I got my fuckin' rhymes on demand
I can run it back
But I'm not allowed to under the rules of Guinness
If I'm trying to fuckin' win this
I will not get winded, I have not rescinded
Anything that I've fucking said
By the end of this shit I'll be fuckin' dead
I'll be seeing red like I said gotta take my meds
That is like Right Said Fred
You just gotta relax
If you wanna come and swing your lyrical battle axe
I don't get lyrical cataracts
So I can see clearly, so I can be dearly
Received, I've got to achieve
Whatever I've got up my sleeve
Whatever I've got in my pouch
Shoutout to pouch, ouch
I pricked my finger, that is not true
But on this mic I will linger for you
And for my crew
This is what I've got to do
I've got to drop it hot for you
'Cause this is why I'm hot
This is why I'm not
Shoutout to Mims
Shoutout to Hims
That's that brand of underwear
That I saw advertised everywhere on the New York subway
I'm drivin' down the one way
I'm cruisin' up the runway
Spreading my wings
Like I am a Cessna
Like I am a chestnut
Roastin' on an open fire, bing!
Crosby, you got me
Me, hot see?
Me Watsky
See?
Sittin' in the hot seat
No, I'm sittin' in the cat-bird seat
But that word, beats droppin' me
And meha coppin'
Shoutout to Frank Macoppin
Playground
In the fuckin' San Francisco SFC
Because you know how this go
We are the best in Dolores Park
We have a chorus singin' in the dark
Hark, the angel
Shoutout to Chuck Rangel
Rangel, I don't remember how to pronounce his name but
In December maybe I will be dismembered
By a fuckin' psychotic type of Santa
Comin' down my chimney
Wavin' fuckin' butcher knives
That‚Äôd be fucking crazy
Who is he
Who is this robotic crazy Santa
Oh my ‚Äòlanta
I can‚Äôt believe that he‚Äôs tryna get me
Instead of giving me presents
I can't believe that he got me on the ground
But I'm like ""no I'm Watsky""
And Santa said ""oh I was just tryna do this shit to a fucked up type of dude""
But I'm like ""that's rude
Santa you've got to improve your fuckin' additude'
Plus I was in the nude
He got me tackled on the ground
My fuckin' whole brood around me
And I got my whole butt out
He's like damn I guess I'll put this knife away
Cut-out
Cut it out like on Full House
John Stamos
John Stains-Most in his pants
But that's okay
We don't judge people who like to dance away the day
If they need a Pepto-Bismol
My throat is not abysmal
This all that I can do is just give this my not screwed-up attempt
I will not repent
And I‚Äôm not demented
But I meant it
When I sent it
From my brain
I'm not plain
Im not fuckin' around
I‚Äôm not cluckin' the ground
Just right there it‚Äôs only two feet
That‚Äôs pretty cool man I eat
From that cup right there
The one that‚Äôs floatin' up in the air
It‚Äôs got a fuckin' strawber-
-ry smoothie
I flow very smoothly
But you cannot do me
Do me, do me like that
I got that roomie type rap
It‚Äôs mad philosophical
I just keep on droppin' all
Of the marbles in my brain
They‚Äôre comin' out my nose
And then they just remain
On the ground
Even the cat‚Äôs eye
That is my favorite fuckin' marble that passed by
Did you know at places
People on the internet watch marble races
I watched one
It was mad fun
I picked the fuckin' blue marble
And my pick wasn't all garbled
It came down the shoot
It was going all fuckin' cool
And then it fuckin scooted past the red one
That kid from The Shining like Red-Rum
Meaning murder
Worder
Wordier
All my flows are so dirtier
Than you could even fuckin' guess
I'm not even fucking stressed
I'm so damn relaxy
Shout out to a Maxi-Pad
For being so absorbent
That's a good fuckin' fuction
My girl's not in her head 'cause she knows it
Put her hands in the air
Maxi Pads doing what they do down there
If you are shaved or if you've got hair
It doesn't matter if you've got a bush or are bare
Do what you wanna
Word to your mama
Your dude can't tell you what you gotta do
Gotta do what you wanna
Make your own choice
With your body or your voice
If you are moist
I know some people don't like that word
Palabra
But you know you gotta like what you like
There was this one time this dude named Ike
Ran to be Prez
And he fuckin' won
Eisenhower, that's what I said
I's a power-rapper
Yes I am
So fuckin' dapper
The clapper
Doesn't work on the lights on this green screen
Man, that would be a dream scene
If I could fuckin' clap and things would fuckin' do what they want
What I want, damn
That would be no scam
I don't eat no Spam
That's 'cause I am a soft boy
And I only eat Bok-Choy
'Cause I'm a little veggie human
And that's what I be doin'
Let me clarify
Like clarified butter
Again, word to your mother
And also not to digress
But I gotta get it off of my chest
Word to Mark Wahlberg
Word to ballers
Wait, okay, let me make my main point
As I rap over this joint
And that is that I don't only eat Bok-Choy
I also eat soy
I also as a Jewish type dude not a goy
Get lots of joy out of eatin' carrots
Out of eatin' broccoli
Out of eatin' lots of trees
Out of smokin' lots of trees
That is true
That is not
I don't smoke a lot
But I do when I party
But during COVID, I party hardly
And I guess that's kinda sad
But I've had some calls with my dad
Paul Watsky
And Claire Watsky
It's rare, stop me
It's not, lots of Sundays
I call my parentals
And I just steal out my fuckin' mentals
But I don't pull out my dentals
I go sometimes I do in a dream
When I am on the scene
And the ghost come and make me scream
It's like you are doing the most
And I gotta fuckin' boast
Shout out to the host, to the boast, the most roast
That is some shit if you take a gander
That was said by Mr. Ned Flanders
Mr. Homer Simpson
I'm the type of dude lots of dudes simps on
They're like ‚ÄúWatsky, I'll do everything for you
I'll white knight for you and your fucking crew‚Äù
I'm like ‚ÄúDude, don't be a simp
Actually, DO be a simp
You could be pimp
You could be wimp
You could fucking walk with a limp
You can have a crimp in your dimp-le‚Äù
I just get the whole tent pole
Up in the sky cause I meant
Lots of people can come in
Cause I got a big tent
So if you are a lame
Fucking get bent
And by lame, what I mean in this game
Is the type of person who says that you're lame
Is the type of person who judges
Is the type of person who never budges
When they get stubborn
Cause you know we got to put our fears in the cupboard
 00:18:04
Word!
I think I got this whole thing turn-ed up
But that is bound to happen
34 hours when you keep on rappin'
Some words are going to collide like trains
Coming head to head, but it remains
To be seen that I get back on the track
With the *ratatat* *tat* *tat* when they *clap clap clap*
With my fucking clapping gums
So don't judge me too much if what I say is dumb
Sometimes
Cause I'm not trying to kick any dumb rhymes
But it happens and I think that is the lesson
That you cannot achieve perfection
And it's not even a worthy goal
You just gotta try to put that ball in the hole
More times than not
This is why I'm hot, as I said
But, you know Man's Not Hot?
Although the truth is, I kinda fuckin' am
'Cause I'm goin' kinda fuckin' ham
On the microphone-o oh no
Can't believe he's like Apollo Anton Ohno
Ice skatin' all over the beat
Makin' it repeat
I do not want to beat my meat, on the camera
That would be a bad fuckin' PR move
When I'm all up in the groove with my meat out
They would be like ""oh, shout out
That will ruin my career
Is that fuckin' clear?
Showin' his whole rear?
He got fuckin' nakey
Make me, take me
You cannot bake me
In my EZ bake oven
No Sara Lee
I just keep on flowing, so merrily
Verily, forsooth, did he do that shit
Oh shit, man he's in the booth dropping it
He's just Frank Coppin it
And there is no halting' it
I just put some fuckin malt in it
Make it like some Yoo-hoo
Yoo-hoo!
Did you fuckin' boo hoo when I rhymed
'Cause you could not rhyme
Like I do, do the crime and you know that I'm
Just puttin' lime on top of this shit
And that's lyme with the L-Y-M-E, envy me
'Cause you know when I put it on top
That I am going to make it drop
To the bottom of the urinal
You're all in my brain
And I'm hearing y'all
But I'm not 'cause I'm not seeing comments
I be too scared to see the tools
But I got to just remain bold
And I've got to stay in the hold
My whole nuts life, oh, my nuts
Remember that shit? Remember Gobble Guts?
Remember jungle?
You might also like
They got lots of range, they fuckin' levitate
Verbally, vocally, stoking the fire
Of the couress I retired
I feel one year
'Cause when my nuts dropped I did not know clear
See how I could sing, that took many years
Before I try to do with the din
And now I only rapped
And now I only try to cap, no cap
I just try to get that back
That back, uh, back
And I'm gone
Over the fence
No shout out to my pens
You know that goth is a dude who's friends with Lynn Maranda

I'm sittin' on the veranda
Just sippin' on my water
Lookin' at my ink blotter
Feelin' like the best
Starin' at my Rorschach test
And it's tellin' me some dark crap
It's tellin' some star type of stuff
Like oh shit, I'm gruff
I'm like Scruff, Scruff, Scruff, my gruff
Scruff, my gruff, Chicago, Illinois
6-0-6-5-2 that I'm
(00:44:22)
You know that a bat kills
Using sonar
Going through the cave
With the lights pulsing like it is a rave
I am not a knave
In the sense of my evil
I'm like Evel Knievel
I can jump over three mics
With my tiny little bike
I am gettin' funky
Did you see that video yesterday with the monkey
On the motorbike
That pulled that kid down the street, yeah that little tike
It was really scary
I didn't eat for like three hours, you dared me
To, but I said that that video was too weird
A monkey trying to steal a kid, man, this dude's clear-ly
A weird type of simian
Type of chimpanzee, I don't know which one
It was, it was in Jakarta, I think?
I don't know what type of the rink
Of this world that I skate
I repeat that I'm late
To the party
But that means that partly I gotta go hardy
Hardly, not like Tom Hardy
I don't like smarties
This is a smoothie by the way, I'm hardly
Eating nothing, I say
I say, good sir
Would you like to duel?
I'll trade you a mule
I'll trade you a tool
I'm going to school
Going to university
Facing adversity
You're seein' the worst in me
I am not burstin' the
Seams, like memes
I'm eating ice creams
I'm chasing my dreams
I'm just tryna seem like a normal dude
But I'm not chilly like Hormal, rude
I am in the can
You know it is not a stamp
What we're doing is real, no fake news
I cannot make you
I cannot take you
Being so far away
I just plant the seed like a caraway
Like a fucking sesame
I want to give you more besame's
More besame
You though?
Besame mucho, when this is all over
(00:46:52)
(00:48:16)
Space Jam 2, fucking Pawnstars
(00:48:19)
What do you feel

Man, will it get real?
(00:50:53)
Squidward you had one job
Flipping them burger patties
Rollin' those damn fatties
I wonder what you think
If you try to blink
Man you can just imagine
That you were underground with an fat one
I mean under the ocean rollin' up
Tryin' to light a blunt in the ocean
I don't think that it would light, what emotion
Do you think if you think of Spongebob
Rollin' up under the ground in a pineapple
Under the sea, that is quite snapple  of me
To tell you exactly, you see?
I smell you, I feel you, E-40
Would say that to me if it was not so portly
If he was not better
Oh shit, I accidentally insulted E-40
And I was not on purpose
Lord, forgive me, I did not mean this to do this
It just came out of my mouth then it felt the rudest
Even though he's a hero compared to Ham Amazero
I am like Chalamet to De Niro
Dinero, oh shit, shout out to the kid Nero
And Deezus, they are like verbally Jesus
With lots of great writing, Josh fuckin' Gondol, man
Writing that shit, man, you know he's beyond the man
Remember that movie Joanna, man?
I don't think that it was very good
I think that it was sorta weak
But you know that a type of wood is cherry or tea
And yes, I can speak, I'm a freak
Of the week and my beak
Just keeps flappin' and I keep rappin'
I wonder when the beat change will happen
What I keep snappin'
My fingers, I linger
I bring her a pain
I bring this game
To a whole new level
I use a tool like a bevel
Holla without, I am not a devil
I am not a bowl evil
Shout out to all people
All creative people
But not all have the same struggle
You know life's a thugga
War, some people got more
And that is the weird shit
The way that we're living
We don't wanna give in
To the system we were born in
And I hate to horn in
With my own damn opinions
But I don't think rackin' pinions
Steering is the best, man, I'm clearin' out my chest
Now I gotta give you what I think
I don't think you should wear mink
But I think everybody should wear pink
I think everybody should stay hydrated and take a drink
I think that fucking Joel Santana
Cameron were ahead of their time
Damn, thinking purple

Six ones so I can have big fun
I'm gonna ball on the wall
With the lights pulsing like it is a rave
I am not a knave
I'm a fan
And you all know
And you all go at your own damn speed
It's kinda odd
That I'm flowing the dude who loves all this poetery
Not odd
But his name is girad
Whatever he has I'm sure it's a great bod
And up on the scene in between
I wanna shout out sierra steen
And be so adroit
To remember to shout out alex niece from detroit
A type of weed is harissa or is that a type of spice
Either way I wanna shout out Alyssa and she's really nice
Coughs
Shit I grab this water
I keep on flowin hotter
Hide your wives and your daughters
That‚Äôs an og meme man
Inkblotter
I can say a whole mouthful
And that‚Äôs me
And I gotta give a shout out to ali
And I'm like goddamn
I give a shoul out to autograph man
And like I gave a shout out to
I just wanna amble
Over to there I don't take a gamble
These are the rarest rhymes I ever spit
This is the rarest three I ever hit
From the middle of the court
Driving down the court in jorts
Oh shit, don't tell Guinness
'Cause I really wanna win-ness
And I really wanna go the distance
All the way to the finish
Shout out to Norwegians and the Finnish
Shout out to dudes who are skittish
And also fucking prudish
I just have a new dish
That I eat everyday for my supper
Shout out to 
I'm like a guppy
Swimming around in his tank
Not a puppy
You cannot stop me
But you see that Watsky has got what it takes
To not pump the brakes
He is not gonna ever
Sever the ties that he's got
He's no Severus Snape
The cleverest ape on the mic
And you know that he likes
And you know that he loves
To do what he can
He's no toucan sam
He leads with his nose but he gives no damn
And he is goin' ham
He has got the slam
Weed, I see that
Fuckin' Jeff has got the vinyls
'Cause I was runnin' out of shit to this, say
Time to get some things to feed my brain
Now he's got the fuckin' vinyls and they will remain on the table
I think I have got to take a little piss break
Shout out to Mugatu from Zoolander
The hammer falls more American 
I am not needy
My mind's not the bearest
Evangeline, Amy Loo Harris
I'm just stayin' alive
Like The Beatles in '65
If I had all the squares I'd hit bingo
John Paul George and Ringo
England's new phenomenal
Pop group, The Beatles, alley oop
Oh shit, like I said
Tchaikovsky and Watsky, I am at the door
Shoutin' out Symphony Number 9 in E Minor
Open 64
I just do my thing, I just am the shit
Shout out to John Chenner's greatest tits
How do you say his name? I don't really know
I'm just tryin' to grow a little more every day
Great tunes, great flows, no rooms
You know I'm ruthless
This is the family library of great music
I keep flowin'
In part because I am inspired by Beethoven
Hello, Nash
That's what Jeff says, man, I got no 
That would be bad, man, I'd fall
Just scratchin' myself, man, but now I stall
I'm talkin' no jive
Just shoutin' out Pablo live
Mary Loo Williams
Take care of yourself
Just do it if you can
Watching is enough

You can just click share o
For how an artist
I'm gonna be frank
I'm not a big fan of hank

A little weirded out
And I really love the
You can leave it there
A taxidermied Iguana XD
This is the coolest gift that I have ever gotten

Now I'm just walking as you hear me talking
Hour Two (1:00:00-1:59:59)
If I was on Facebook then I would poke
Every single one of you, but it's nothing romantic
Shout out to Pacific, to Atlantic
And even the Baltic and the Mediterranean
And I am just an alien
When I'm makin' these rhymes
And I'm feelin' so fine
But it is no crime
And I don't get slime
New beat, turn it up a bit
Let me hear it, I'm just fuckin' with it
And I know that now up on this beat
Max Miller Lauren makin' you move your feet
Got the people buzzin'
Max is my first cousin
Wasn't he in Invisible Inc?
He was, oh, that makes you think
Take a little drink
My other glass clink
I cannot blink
Shout out to Link
From Zelda, Melda
Whole lot of people together held ya
In your arms like the Ocarina
Waka Flocka Flame Ocarina
Ballerina aminda
Keep on going, keep on giving
Keep on living, keep on thriving
On this mic I am surviving
Actually, maybe turn it down at here
'Cause you know I care but
If I rap too loud
I think my voice will go horse
I think my voice will go donkey
I think my voice will go mule
I was just rappin' 'bout high rule
That was the dual wear fuckin' link live that
I just got these big raps
A tiger is a big cat
But I don't give a big crap
Oh shit, he really get that
I don't go tip for tap
I don't hold the grudge
I just keep on droppin', I'm like Harren Judge
He is on the yankees
And I gotta say this frankly
I really miss baseball
And mix all the troubles melt away
But we don't have it on Saturdays
Or Sundays or Mondays or Wednesdays or Tues'
But we just pay our dues
Keep on rockin', keep on rappin' for our crews
Keep on doin' what we can for our friends
'Cause they're gonna be the ones in the end
To hold our hand when everything else melts away
When it all goes dark
You gotta all go back to the people from the ones that you knew at the start
I got a lot of great beats comin'
Goin' and drummin'
From my folks
Crackin' like some yokes
You know that I hope
We're gonna heat, go and drop in this dope
And I never will mope
Evermore like the battle
Forever more Led Zep
Shout out to my dude Shep
He's a real hep cat
Do you fuckin' get that?
He was the best that I ever knew
The best that I ever saw
I'm just droppin' bust, all type rhymes
'Cause you know I gotta do this like I'm
A circular saw when I'm wearin' my Birkin stocks
Used to be that I'd work a lot
Now we work a lot tryna get our tour set up
Again 'cause you know that we got these friends
That are promoters in conserve and you owners
And even the fuckin' stage hens
That y'all make it happen
They gon' make it go
They on, make the gear spin
We're winning together as one
Did you think that this could happen?
Oh shit, I got some fuckin' shoutouts
That I get to really say
But we don't really play
No, we don't do that today
Okay, ouch, ouch, it's the shoutouts
That I gotta give to the Beatrice Teer
So everybody knows that if you wanna go
Get a shoutout, is this too on the nose?
You gotta go to watskyrelief dot com
Where you can drop those financial bombs
Pay us some owns, pays us some respects
And at the ten dollar level you get what's next
That is for meet up, say your name on the stream
 start
Never flippin' the bird
Never droppin' a turd
Never gettin' so scurred
That my vision is blurred
Just to keep goin
Just to keep hoping
Just to keep ropin
All of these cattle
Doing this battle
Good against evil
Never gonna leave
Never gonna be
A dude named Steve
I'm never gonna change the name
I'm gonna change the game
You think you can stop me but you can't
I'm outta control like an ant


Hour Three (2:00:00-2:59:59)
I wonder, I've got this doubt
To my girlfriend I'll shout
Amber, do you think I'm saying ""fuck"" too much on the stream? I'm saying ""fuckin'"" a lot
Did that make 'em scream?
That's cool, say it fuckin' more
Oh curl, oh curl, like Cardi B
I put glow hardly into this dark night, man, I'm saying
Fucking, fucking, fucking, fucking, man, I'm sprayin'
Man, over this concrete
On this fucking dope beat
Oh shit, this is ham
Pin me in, this is the one I begin
To flow easily
This flow is so easy, see
No Eazy-E
You are all pleasing me
It's no
 start
Is the place that I rap
My throat sounds like I got strap
I got a limp in my step
But I don't ever dip
And I don't wear a slip
I gotta keep it up at the same clip
I woke up with a headache
But I still felt pretty relaxed
I knew in a couple hours
 start
Because he was pouring sweat
A whole bunch of pictures
People thought he looked really bad
Looked really sweaty
They didn't elect him
Because he had
A real bad demeanor
And betweener
All of us
That's just politucs
What do we got next?
What's a history lesson in which the people can be blessed?
Looks like a big battleship
I'm not rattled if
That's what you think
I hope you don't blink
I don't know what this is all about
A hairdresser, man, I'm callin' out
And we're the confessor
All upon my dresser
I will not pester you
And I will not tester
There's some boobies in this pic
That's cool, free the nipple, man, that's real slick
Honestly, the male nipple and the female nipple
I don't really get the difference, man, is it that simple?
Why is one obscene?
Why is one unclean?
I guess that's just what we could talk to think
That stinks
This is a dude clean, fucking clear net
I wonder who is it yet
He's in Paris
That's very romantic
They're across the Atlantic
Oh shit, this is the grassy knoll
That's the picture that I hold
That's the day JFK got popped
In its open top car he was shot
When he rolled up in Dallas
And a shooter on the hill has such malice
And he shot him and he died
That was really sad, I know my mom cried
She was in shock 'cause a little child
Man, for the whole nation that must've been wild
And there's RFK
No wait, that's wrong
You know I don't play, that's his son
RFK is here
Kennedy's son is here, man, saluting near to his father
This is the Pope
I think that's right
Gettin' harder, it's dope
Oh that's wrong, it's Irish play ride John OKC
Get all these facts right, man, you can't make me
Being wrong, that's my emo
On this mic I just spit more emo
Will I stop? I just say heck no
Yeah, here is the Pope
I guess that's just the coincidence he was on the next page, that's dope
I'm not at the end of my rope
At my rope I'm at the beginning
On the path to winning
Here's the cover about Uranus
Here's a dude swinging his kids
Around with his arms
I think that's good parenting
I think you gotta let kids do their own harm
And make their own mistakes
Man, you can't treat them a kid, glubs
That would not be great
Not at my best
But that's cool off my chest
Off my mind, can't expect to be perfect
Who just gotta keep it
Moon event, you gotta have, make it
Go, you gotta take it so slow
If you're gonna cross the finish line
If you're gonna get in time
Oh shit, it's the Fab 4
Yeah, The Beatles, that's more incredible
Than you could believe
Look at John Lennon with his crazy fuckin' sleeves
His military shirt, is that Audrey Hepburn?
I think that is, man, I'm no half stepper
What I think that was, the jacket from that campaign
You can't tell me that that's lame
So iconic
Wow, it's demonic
Harry Belafonte? That's incredible
Man, practically edible
Damn, I don't know
Woodstock, should be Hetrix
Who knows? You could blow

To go to sleep but this

So if a pigeon flies up to me outside
I be like ""Man, your wings are how wide?""

But if you like me, you can take a gander
Out in gondor with the rings
Where they have the legend and the three kings
Man, I'm still beasting

Was he a dog or a rat?
I don't remember what animal that dude had
In his genome

I just keep goin' and goin' and goin'
Don't quit it
I just hit it this rhythm
And tried to get wid, umm

One of the extras playing a dead body in the background lies up.

The director sighs then snaps his fingers. A man in the background runs towards the extra with a blanket and covers him with it.
DIRECTOR: This is the actual field, they tell me.
ACTOR: What?
DIRECTOR: It's the actual battlefield-- Massacre at Sioux Falls. I think 300 of your people-- Braves-- died here, what, 100 years ago?

DODD:  Said 11:00, not noon.

DODD: Say it again.

Dodd lets Rye out of the headlock
DODD: Where's the goddamn money?

FLOYD (nodding her head): Mm
Door opens
OTTO: About time.
Dodd walks into the room
DODD: Give me a break.
Dodd takes off his hat. He whistles to his brother Bear, signaling him to get off the chair he‚Äôs sitting on. Bear stands up, but blocks Dodd‚Äôs way. Dodd slightly shoves Bear as he moves to the chair. Bear walks over to a shelf nearby and picks off a piece of bread.
OTTO (to Dodd and Bear): Soon as you ladies are done dancing‚Äî
Floyd: You're right. We're light, even though the transport dollars went up. It's the local business-- gambling and drugs‚Ä¶ and whores.
Dodd takes a seat
OTTO: Meine keine gute soehne?
DODD: Don't pin this on me.
BEAR: Or me. We earned.
OTTO: But not Rye.
FLOYD: No. But even without his nut, we shouldn't be this short. It's like we're a balloon leaking air all over.

Rye sighs, then whistles to the man
RYE: Giddyup there, cowboy.

RYE: What'd you say?
MAN:  You heard me.
Rye pulls out a gun and cocks it, pointing it at the man
SKIP: Jesus. Just-- (stammers) -- it's in the mail, okay? The check. Just-- if it hasn't come by Tuesday, I'll write you another.
Skip leads the man out of the store, with Rye still pointing his gun at him.
RYE: Yeah, that's right. You better run.
Rye tucks his gun away
SKIP: Come on, now. He could call a cop.
RYE: He's not calling anybody. Guys like that, they're just big on the outside. So, where's this miracle contraption?

INT. WAFFLE HUT- NIGHT
Rye enters the Waffle Hut. He stares at the judge seated at the table. Rye walks over to take a seat by the counter. He wipes his nose with a napkin and puts it in an ashtray. He turns his head to look at the judge.
WAITRESS: Special's tuna melt and fries. Pie is humbleberry.
RYE: Just coffee.
Rye sees a black cook in the kitchen looking at the customers orders. The waitress pours Rye a cup of coffee. He looks back to the judge.  There is a family at the table next to the judge chatting.
MAN: Everything‚Äôs taken care of, see? They didn‚Äôt even charge us for the fries.
WAITRESS (to Rye): Sugar?
RYE: Uh, you know, you're freaking me out a little.
The waitress leaves the sugar by Rye and walks away to clean the counters. Rye takes the sugar and pours it into his coffee. He sips it. He turns his attention back to the judge.
MAN: Honey, I don‚Äôt know about your day, but my day was crazy‚Ä¶ he squeezes and the mustard goes all over his shirt. And he now has no shirt to wear, so now‚Ä¶
There is laughter coming from the family at the table next to the judge. Everyone there then leaves.
MAN: I got to pay up. I'll meet you at the cash register.
Family walks out of the restaurant, with the man paying at the register. Rye continues to stare at the judge.
WAITRESS: How was everything?
MAN: Oh, yeah. Real good.
WAITRESS: Oh, good.  I'll get your change.
Cash register dings
WAITRESS: There you are.
MAN: Thanks.
Cut to Rye walking to the Judges table and sitting opposite from her.
RYE: Hi.
JUDGE: No.
RYE: What do you mean, ""No?""
JUDGE: Whatever you're selling, I ain't buying.
The judge looks at her burger and signals for the waitress.
RYE: First of all, I'm not selling anything. And second--
The waitress arrives at the table
JUDGE: He needs to make me another burger. This one's a coaster.
WAITRESS: Yes, ma'am.
The waitress takes the plate and walks away.
RYE: Hey. Your majesty. You're gonna change your mind about
something- a case.
JUDGE: Or what?
RYE: Or you'll find out, is what. This isn't one of those optional check ""A"" or ""B"" scenarios. I'm gonna change your mind.
Judge (sighing): One day, the Devil came to God and said, ""Let's make a bet between you and me for the soul of a man."" And from on high they looked down on Job, a devout man, religious. And the Devil said, ""I can change his mind and make him curse your name. "" And God said, ""Try and you will only fail."" So the Devil begins. He kills Job's herds and takes his fields. He plagues him with boils and throws him on the ash heap. But Job's mind remains unchanged. So I ask you, son, if the Devil couldn't change Job's mind, how the hell are you gonna change mine?
RYE: What?
JUDGE: You're a little dim, aren't you?
RYE: Listen, this is-- There's two ways this can go-
JUDGE: Is one of them the hard way?
RYE: Easy‚Äî(pounds table) --- You know what? There's a fella who needs to get his hands on some typewriters.
JUDGE: Ugh. Christ. You're with that fool.
RYE: And you're gonna- Yeah. You‚Äôre-
The judge looks into her purse and pulls out bug spray
JUDGE: Son, you have three second to pick your ass up and get out of here, or I'm gonna squash you like a bug.
RYE (laughing): Okay, look, bitch-- I'm the one do‚Äî
The judge sprays Rye‚Äôs face.
RYE (gagging): God damn, my eyes!
Rye stands in agony
JUDGE: Now scram before I call the cops!
Rye pulls his gun out of his coat
JUDGE: Oh, crap.
Rye shoots the judge. The cook in the kitchen sees this, grabs
a pan, and quickly runs out the door leading to the dining area. He screams and charges towards Rye with the pan in hand, but Rye shoots him down before he could reach him. The waitress behind Rye screams in a panic and drops the coffee picture, shattering it. She is also shot down. Rye is breathing heavily. The judge surprisingly rises up from behind Rye and stabs him in the back with a knife. Rye grunts at the wound, then turns and fires three more rounds at the judge. The judge falls back and lands on the table, her blood spilling out and colliding with a spilled glass of milk. Rye is in pain from his knife wound. Struggling, he pulls out the knife from his back.
Cut to Rye stealing from the cash register. He is alerted by the door bell. He walks over to find the waitress gone.
RYE: Shhh- Shit!
EXT. WAFFLE HUT- NIGHT
Rye sees the wounded waitress walking away, struggling to escape.
RYE: Sh- Shit!
Rye pulls out his gun and walks up closer to shoot the waitress, but he is out of ammo.
RYE: Shit! Shhhhhit!
Rye reloads. He shoots the waitress, and she drops dead in the snow. Rye runs up to the fallen body, gun still pointed at her. He breathes heavily, looking panicked with what to do.  A bright light captures Rye‚Äôs attention. He walks over closer to where the light is approaching. The light comes closer, revealing itself to be a UFO. Rye stares at it in awe. The UFO stops for a few seconds to where Rye is before speeding off in the distance. Still distracted by what he saw, he is struck unaware by an incoming car from behind. The car halts to an immediate stop, and we see an unconscious Rye jammed in the windshield headfirst. The car drives off.
INT. SOLVERSONE RESIDENCE
Lou is reading his daughter Molly a bedtime story as the camera scans various rooms in the house, such as the dining room where unfinished dinner plates, glasses, and silverware are still on the table, and the living room which looks messy with toys and the like scattered around. Betsy is carrying a laundry basket with clean clothes upstairs and puts some clothes in a drawer. The telephone rings.
LOU (laughing): ""'Oh, whocky!' Cried Joel. 'See what you've done, Polly Pepper?' but Polly didn't hear. Over the big, flat door-stone she sped and met Ben with Little David coming in the gate. His face was just like Phronsie's! And with a cold, heavy feeling at her heart, Polly realized this was no play. 'Oh, Ben!' She cried, flinging her arms around his neck and bursting into tears. 'Don't! Please. I-I wish you wouldn't. Phronsie's got 'em, and that's enough. 'Got what?' Asked Ben, while Davie's eyes grew to their widest proportions. 'Oh, measles!' Cried Polly, bursting out afresh. 'Hatefulest, horridest measles! And now you're taken!' 'Oh, no, I ain't,' responded Ben cheerfully, who knew what measles were. 'Wipe up, Polly. I'm all right.""'Only my head aches and my eyes feel funny. ' Polly, only half reassured, gulped down her sobs and the sorrowful trio repaired to mother. 'Oh, dear me,' ejaculated Mrs. Pepper, sinking in a chair at the dismay at the sight of Ben's red face. 'Whatever will we do now?'""
Lou turns the book to look at the front
This is a funny book, huh? Yeah.

Lou follows a trail blood leading away from the restaurant, finding the dead waitress at the spot she was shot down by Rye.

Lou lifts a part of the coat off her.
LOU: Yeah.

INT. WAFFLE HUT- NIGHT
Lou enters the restaurant and sees the blood splatter on the floor and two dead bodies. He puts the flashlight away. He continues scanning the scene, and sees the empty cash register open.
LOU (sighing): Yeah.
Lou walks over to where the judge‚Äôs dead body is. He takes out a pen and notepad. The doorbell rings and a man in police uniform enters. Lou nods at the man, who is the sheriff.
HANK: Well, this is a deal.
LOU: I count three dead.
HANK: Saw the waitress in the parking lot?
LOU: Mm. I think she caught one there, then staggered out. Gunman followed, made things permanent.
Hank shines his flashlight on the dead cook and approaches him.
HANK: That's Henry Blanton. Got the single-season touchdown record in 10th grade. 31. Still stands.
Lou flashes his light on the judge‚Äôs body.
HANK: Yeah. Don't know her.
LOU: North Dakota plates on a Mercedes outside.
HANK: Tourist, you're thinking?
LOU: Mm.
HANK: How's Betsy?
LOU: You mean you didn't call her before you came over?
HANK: Well, yeah. Just being polite. Give you a chance to talk
about your feelings, should you be so disposed.
LOU: She's good. Yeah. Ordered this kit of recipe cards. Saw it on the TV. So now every night, we eat delicacies of the world.
HANK: Mm. Some men like that. Variety.
LOU: Mm. She put a souffl√© on the table last night-- perfectly good casserole-- and lit it on fire with a kitchen match.
HANK: Huh?
LOU: Oh, which reminds me-- you're invited for dinner
tomorrow.
HANK: 6:00?
LOU: Mm-hmm.
Hank (inhaling sharply): I'll bring a suit of armor.
Camera lingers over the dead cook.
EXT. WAFFLE HUT- NIGHT
Hank and Lou are inspecting the road.
LOU: Skid marks.
HANK: Yeah. I see them. 'Course, connecting those to this deal here would be what we call ""jumping to a conclusion.‚Äù Based on the number of bodies, I'm thinking we've got one car too many in the parking lot.
Split-screen- the right half shows an object covered in snow while the left shows Lou walking over towards it. It is revealed to be a dollar-bill covered in blood.
LOU: Yeah. So, the shooter's got a wound or two in him from the steak knife. Two blood trails lead out. One to the waitress, now deceased. The other to the road here, where he absconds, leaving a few dollars behind.
HANK Uh-huh. Why not take his own car?
LOU: Unclear at this time.
Hank spots something up above.
HANK: There's a shoe in that tree.
LOU: There sure is.
HANK: So, uh, this a local matter or do the State Police want it?
LOU: We do not.
HANK (chuckling): Local matter it is.
LOU: And, of course, any support the State can provide.
HANK: Yeah, of course. See you tomorrow night, then, eh?
LOU: 6:00. Be ready for anything.
Lou walks away.

BJORN: G-53. G-53.
LOU: Well, I better get home. Betsy had her chemo today.
KARL: God!
Karl smashes his fist against the table.
SONNY: What is it, Karl?
KARL: It's just-- God damn. Unacceptable is what it is. A woman like that in the prime of her. With a young daughter. Tell her if John McCain could hold out for 5 1/2 years against Viet Cong thumbscrews, she can beat this cancer bullshit in her sleep.

ED: Oh. Sorry. I'll put them in the fridge.
Ed puts the porkchops in the refrigerator.
ED: Hamburger helper?
PEGGY: And Tater Tots.
ED: Yum.
Ed walks over to the table. There is a stack full of magazines
on the chair.
ED: Should I--
PEGGY: Oh, hon. Don't. I just got that stuff organized.
Peggy pulls out a tray from the oven.
ED: Yeah, but my chair. Where am I supposed to‚Äî
PEGGY: - Well, sit there, huh?
Peggy points to a smaller chair nearby.
ED: Yeah.
Ed grabs the smaller chair and puts it at the table.
PEGGY: I'll move that stuff tomorrow. Promise.
Peggy brings over their food.
PEGGY: Bon appetite.
ED: Mm.
Peggy and Ed hold hands and say grace.
EXT. SOLVERSONE RESIDENCE- NIGHT
Lou gets out of his police car and walks to his house.
INT. SOLVERSONE RESIDENCE
Lou takes off his weapons holster and puts it on the couch. He walks over to the kitchen where Betsy is.
BETSY: So, you think there was an accomplice and a getaway car?
LOU: Your dad called.
Lou opens the fridge and pulls out a carton of milk.
BETSY: You know him. Likes to talk things through before he goes to bed.
Lou drinks from the carton.
BETSY (sighing): We got glasses.
LOU: Tastes different in a glass. Molly go down okay?
BETSY: Mm-hmm. Oh, you know, I forgot earlier-- She made
you something at school today.
Betsy puts an ashtray made of clay on the counter.
LOU: Yeah? She knows I don't smoke, right?
BETSY: You could start.
Lou chuckles.
LOU: Your dad said he'd be over Sunday in a suit of armor.
BETSY: Ugh. Geez. You light one souffl√© on fire‚Äî
Both laugh. Lou rubs his face and has a concerned look. Betsy kisses Lou on the shoulder and pats his back. Lou
continues looking at the ashtray.
INT. BLUMQUIST, DINNER TABLE
PEGGY: So, I'm getting excited about this seminar.
ED: The which?
PEGGY: You remember, hon. It's next weekend. Constance is
taking me. Lifespring. Everybody's doing it
Peggy pours ketchup on her plate.
ED: Oh, yeah.
PEGGY: I really think this course is gonna help me actualize, you know, fully. Re-examine old reflex patterns-- the ones that keep my life from working.
ED: From-- 'Cause we're doing great, yeah?
PEGGY Oh, yeah. I just mean me, you know? As a person.
ED: Yeah.
PEGGY: Yeah.
Both chuckle.
ED: Well, Bud asked again if I was interested in maybe taking
over the butcher shop.
PEGGY: Mm.
ED: Said he's thinking of retiring end of the year.
PEGGY: Just had the end of the year, huh?
ED: Yeah, I guess he means this year, but wouldn't that be great? (takes a bite) Me owning the shop, maybe you take over the salon one day. You know , unless we got a whole litter of kids by then.
PEGGY: Yeah, that's (sips water)-- We talked about that. We're trying, but it takes time, you know?
ED: Yeah. Yeah, of course. Though, uh hon-- ""trying""-- I mean, last time I checked, there's just the one way to make a baby, you know?
PEGGY: Did that last weekend, didn't we? (takes a bite)
ED: It was Bear Lake last weekend. You said you didn't want to-- - not with Kevin and Sally‚Äî
PEGGY: - Hon.
ED: I ju‚Äî(chuckles) I just-- uh-- I just love you, is all. So, so much. And, come on, our kids would be amazing.
A thump in the distance alerts Peggy and Ed. Peggy looks at Ed nervously and purposely knocks over her glass of water.
PEGGY: Oh, shoot!
ED: Here. Hon, let me--
Ed wipes the water on the floor.
PEGGY: No, it-it's fine. I'm-- I'm such a bumble sometimes.
Another thump in the distance.
ED: What the heck?
Peggy grabs hold of Ed affectionately.
PEGGY: I-I love you, too, hon, so, so much. Maybe we should-- Maybe do it right now.
ED: Here?
PEGGY: No, silly. In the bedroom. Come on.
The thump continues.
ED: Geez. I better go see what that‚Äî
Cut to Ed heading to the garage.
PEGGY: We can-- I'll wear that nightie you like.
Peggy nervously cups her hands to her face. Ed turns on the garage light, revealing a car with a large hole windshield, stained with blood.
Ed: What the-- Hon?
Peggy slowly takes a look at the car.
PEGGY: Didn't I tell you? I kind of hit a deer.
ED: You hit a-- Are you-- you okay?
PEGGY: Yeah, no, I-I'm just, you know, shook up, mostly.
Ed walks closer to the car.
ED: Geez. Well, insurance should cover most‚Äî
The thumping continues- this time much closer.
PEGGY: Actually, I-- I think I need to sit down, hon. Can we go in the kitchen?
There is heavy breathing accompanying the thumps.
ED: Heck, hon, did you bring the deer home?
Ed moves closer to where the noise is coming from.
PEGGY: Hon, don't.
Ed walks to a small narrow part of the garage. He taps his flashlight continuously to get it working and see what is making that sound. the flashlight flickers on and off, revealing a figure in the corner.
PEGGY: Hon, don't.
Ed continues tapping the flashlight.
PEGGY: Hon! Come back! Don't.
The flashlight finally turns on fully.
ED: Ah, geez. T-there's a-- It's a man. There's a man in the‚Äî
The deranged man charges at Ed with a knife in hand. A struggle ensues. Ed pushes the man back into a stack of tires. He grabs a garden knife out of a bag of fertilizer close by him. The man charges at Ed again, but Ed manages to stab him with the garden knife in the abdomen. Ed pulls it out and the man falls dead on the ground, covered in blood. Ed is panting heavily.
ED: Oh, my God. Oh-- oh, my God.
Peggy walks over to Ed and puts a hand on his shoulder.
PEGGY: Hon.
Ed is caught off guard and accidentally elbows Peggy‚Äôs head.
ED: Geez, hon. Sorry. Are y-you okay?
PEGGY: No, it's-- I'm fine.
ED: Who‚Äî
PEGGY: - You got to believe me. I-I thought he was dead.
ED: What?
PEGGY: When I hit him, I thought he was‚Äî
ED: You hit him?
A flashback shows Rye getting hit by the car at the Waffle Hut, revealing that it was Peggy‚Äôs doing.
ED: You hit him with the car? You-- you said a deer.
The flashback shows Peggy getting out of the car and looking around nervously. She gets back in the car. The blood leaking out of Rye‚Äôs head is dripping on the car seat, where Peggy‚Äôs stuff is at. She whimpers and moves her stuff away from the blood.
ED: You hit him. Why-- why didn't you go to the police or the hospital?
PEGGY: He ran out into the road, hon. What was I supposed to do?
ED: Yeah, so-- so you brought him home, made dinner-- Hamburger Helper.
The flashback shows Peggy arriving at the house, pulling up in the garage with Rye still stuck in the window. She turned off the garage light. The split-screen appears focusing on Peggy trying to clean herself up.
PEGGY: I panicked, okay?
ED: We-- we got to call the police. Why didn't you call the police?
PEGGY: - No.
ED: - We gotta-- Maybe he's not‚Äî
PEGGY: No, no. No. I-- I-- Hon, listen to me. I ran over him. Hit and run. And-- and then you stabbed him with a gardening tool. The cops-- do you think they're gonna believe us?
ED: I don't know. But-- but people are gonna look for him.
Peggy: But-- but look. Look. I-I was careful. I-I drove the back way all the way home.
ED: You drove the-- Hon, a-a man's dead.
PEGGY: Well, that's why we have to clean it up and-- and tell people I hit a deer or‚Ä¶
Peggy flashbacks to cleaning herself up in the mirror, with the camera panning to a picture of Hollywood Beach.
PEGGY: - We could run.
ED: What?
PEGGY: Go to California.
ED: Calif-f-f (sighing)‚Ä¶ No. (scoffing) We have a life here, hon. A family. I'm gonna buy the shop.
Flashback to the butcher shop
ED: Okay, then.
BUD: Okay, then.
NOREEN:  Okay, then.
ED: And we're gonna start a f-family.
PEGGY: Well, start again, I'm saying.
ED: I don't want to.
PEGGY: Okay, then. You-- Then, hon, look at me. If we're gonna get clear of this, then we're gonna have to clean it up. Pretend it didn't happen.
Ed and Peggy sit on the steps.
PEGGY: 'Cause if this comes out, if this-- then all the things you want, that we want-- that's over. (Scoffs) I go to jail and maybe you also. And then there's no shop and no family. No kids.
ED: Okay. Okay, then. We-- we clean it up.
PEGGY: We clean it up.
INT. SOLVERSONE RESIDENCE, BEDROOM- NIGHT
Lou is looking out the window, fiddling with a rope. Betsy is
lying in bed reading. She looks over at Lou and closes her book.
BETSY: Well, should we call that Saturday?
LOU: I suppose we better. She'll be up at 5:00 anyway wanting to play dolls.
Lou puts the rope away in the drawer.
BETSY: And I know how fond you are of your doll-playing time.
Lou chuckles. Betsy and Lou turn off their lamps and kiss each other.
BETSY: Good night, Mr. Solverson.
LOU: Good night, Mrs. Solverson, and all the ships at sea.
The camera closes up on the two, who are still awake. Both eventually close their eyes.

We hear a thud.
FLOYD: No! Oh! Otto! Live! Get the doctor! Go now! Now! Otto. Call the doctor. Go!

His (Stephen's) mind was not exactly what you would call wandering but a bit unsteady and on his expressed desire for some beverage to drink Mr Bloom, in view of the hour it was and there being no pumps of Vartry water available for their ablutions, let alone drinking purposes, hit upon an expedient by suggesting, off the reel, the propriety of the cabman's shelter, as it was called, hardly a stonesthrow away near Butt Bridge, where they might hit upon some drinkables in the shape of a milk and soda or a mineral. But how to get there was the rub. For the nonce he was rather nonplussed but inasmuch as the duty plainly devolved upon him to take some measures on the subject he pondered suitable ways and means during which Stephen repeatedly yawned. So far as he could see he was rather pale in the face so that it occurred to him as highly advisable to get a conveyance of some description which would answer in their then condition, both of them being e. d. ed, particularly Stephen, always assuming that there was such a thing to be found. Accordingly, after a few such preliminaries, as, in spite of his having forgotten to take up his rather soapsuddy handkerchief after it had done yeoman service in the shaving line, brushing, they both walked together along Beaver street, or, more properly, lane, as far as the farrier's and the distinctly fetid atmosphere of the livery stables at the corner of Montgomery street where they made tracks to the left from thence debouching into Amiens Street round by the corner of Dan Bergin's. But, as he confidently anticipated, there was not a sign of a Jehu plying for hire anywhere to be seen except a fourwheeler, probably engaged by some fellows inside on the spree, outside the North Star Hotel and there was no symptom of its budging a quarter of an inch when Mr Bloom, who was anything but a professional whistler, endeavoured to hail it by emitting a kind of a whistle, holding his arms arched over his head, twice.
This was a quandary but, bringing commonsense to bear on it, evidently there was nothing for it but put a good face on the matter and foot it which they accordingly did. So, bevelling around by Mullet's and the Signal House, which they shortly reached, they proceeded perforce in the direction of Amiens street railway terminus, Mr Bloom being handicapped by the circumstance that one of the back buttons of his trousers had, to vary the timehonoured adage, gone the way of all buttons, though, entering thoroughly into the spirit of the thing, he heroically made light of the mischance. So, as neither of them were particularly pressed for time, as it happened, and the temperature refreshing since it cleared up after the recent visitation of Jupiter Pluvius, they dandered along past by where the empty vehicle was waiting without a fare or a jarvey. As it so happened a Dublin United Tramways Company's sandstrewer happening to be returning the elder man recounted to his companion √† propos of the incident his own truly miraculous escape of some little while back. They passed the main entrance of the Great Northern railway station, the starting point for Belfast, where of course all traffic was suspended at that late hour, and, passing the back door of the morgue (a not very enticing locality, not to say gruesome to a degree, more especially at night), ultimately gained the Dock Tavern and in due course turned into Store street, famous for its C division police station. Between this point and the high, at present unlit, warehouses of Beresford Place Stephen thought to think of Ibsen, associated with Baird's, the stonecutter's, in his mind somehow in Talbot Place, first turning on the right, while the other, who was acting as his fidus Achates, inhaled with internal satisfaction the smell of James Rourke's city bakery, situated quite close to where they were, the very palatable odour indeed of our daily bread, of all commodities of the public the primary and most indispensable. Bread, the staff of life, earn your bread, O tell me where is fancy bread? At Rourke's the baker's, it is said.
En route, to his taciturn, and, not to put too fine a point on it, not yet perfectly sober companion, Mr Bloom, who at all events, was in complete possession of his faculties, never more so, in fact disgustingly sober, spoke a word of caution re the dangers of nighttown, women of ill fame and swell mobsmen, which, barely permissible once in a while, though not as a habitual practice, was of the nature of a regular deathtrap for young fellows of his age particularly if they had acquired drinking habits under the influence of liquor unless you knew a little juijitsu for every contingency as even a fellow on the broad of his back could administer a nasty kick if you didn't look out. Highly providential was the appearance on the scene of Corny Kelleher when Stephen was blissfully unconscious that, but for that man in the gap turning up at the eleventh hour, the finis might have been that he might have been a candidate for the accident ward, or, failing that, the Bridewell and an appearance in the court next day before Mr Tobias, or, he being the solicitor, rather old Wall, he meant to say, or Malony which simply spelt ruin for a chap when it got bruited about. The reason he mentioned the fact was that a lot of those policemen, whom he cordially disliked, were admittedly unscrupulous in the service of the Crown and, as Mr Bloom put it, recalling a case or two in the A Division in Clanbrassil street, prepared to swear a hole through a ten gallon pot. Never on the spot when wanted but in quiet parts of the City, Pembroke Road, for example, the guardians of the law were well in evidence, the obvious reason being they were paid to protect the upper classes. Another thing he commented on was equipping soldiers with firearms or sidearms of any description, liable to go off at any time, which was tantamount to inciting them against civilians should by any chance they fall nut over anything. You frittered away your time, he very sensibly maintained, and health and also character besides which the squandermania of the thing, fast women of the demimonde ran away with a lot of #. s. d. into the bargain and the greatest danger of all was who you got drunk with though, touching the much vexed question of stimulants, he relished a glass of choice old wine in season as both nourishing and blood-making and possessing aperient virtues (notably a good burgundy which he was a staunch believer in) still never beyond a certain point where he invariably drew the line as it simply led to trouble all round to say nothing of your being at the tender mercy of others practically. Most of all he commented adversely on the desertion of Stephen by all his pubhunting confr√®res but one, a most glaring piece of ratting on the part of his brother medicos under all the circs.
‚ÄîAnd that one was Judas, said Stephen, who up to then had said nothing whatsoever of any kind.
Discussing these and kindred topics they made a beeline across the back of the Customhouse and passed under the Loop Line bridge when a brazier of coke burning in front of a sentrybox, or something like one, attracted their rather lagging footsteps. Stephen of his own accord stopped for no special reason to look at the heap of barren cobblestones and by the light emanating from the brazier he could just make out the darker figure of the corporation watchman inside the gloom of the sentrybox. He began to remember that this had happened, or had been mentioned as having happened, before but it cost him no small effort before he remembered that he recognised in the sentry a quondam friend of his father's Gumley. To avoid a meeting be drew nearer to the pillars of the railway bridge.
‚ÄîSomeone saluted you, Mr Bloom said.
A figure of middle height on the prowl, evidently, under the arches saluted again, calling: Night! Stephen, of course, started rather dizzily and stopped to return the compliment. Mr Bloom, actuated by motives of inherent delicacy, inasmuch as he always believed in minding his own business, moved off but nevertheless remained on the qui vive with just a shade of anxiety though not funkyish in the least. Although unusual in the Dublin area, he knew that it was not by any means unknown for desperadoes who had next to nothing to live on to be about waylaying and generally terrorising peaceable pedestrians by placing a pistol at their head in some secluded spot outside the city proper, famished loiterers of the Thames embankment category they might be hanging about there or simply marauders ready to decamp with whatever boodle they could in one fell swoop at a moments notice, your money or your life, leaving you there to point a moral, gagged and garotted.
Stephen, that is when the accosting figure came to close quarters, though he was not in any over sober state himself, recognised Corley's breath redolent of rotten cornjuice. Lord John Corley, some called him, and his genealogy came about in this wise. He was the eldest son of Inspector Corley of the G Division, lately deceased, who had married a certain Katherine Brophy, the daughter of a Louth farmer. His grandfather, Patrick Michael Corley, of New Ross, had married the widow of a publican there whose maiden name had been Katherine (also) Talbot. Rumour had it, though not proved, that she descended from the house of the Lords Talbot de Malahide in whose mansion, really an unquestionably fine residence of its kind and well worth seeing, his mother or aunt or some relative had enjoyed the distinction of being in service in the washkitchen. This, therefore, was the reason why the still comparatively young though dissolute man who now addressed Stephen was spoken of by some with facetious proclivities as Lord John Corley.
Taking Stephen on one side he had the customary doleful ditty to tell. Not as much as a farthing to purchase a night's lodgings. His friends had all deserted him. Furthermore, he had a row with Lenehan and called him to Stephen a mean bloody swab with a sprinkling of other uncalled-for expressions. He was out of a job and implored of Stephen to tell him where on God's earth he could get something, anything at all to do. No, it was the daughter of the mother in the washkitchen that was fostersister to the heir of the house or else they were connected through the mother in some way, both occurrences happening at the same time if the whole thing wasn't a complete fabrication from start to finish. Anyhow, he was ill in.
‚ÄîI wouldn't ask you, only, pursued he, on my solemn oath and God knows I'm on the rocks.
‚ÄîThere'll be a job tomorrow or the next day, Stephen told him, in a boys' school at Dalkey for a gentleman usher. Mr Garret Deasy. Try it. You may mention my name.
‚ÄîAh, God, Corley replied, sure I couldn't teach in a school, man. I was never one of your bright ones, he added with a half laugh. Got stuck twice in the junior at the Christian Brothers.
‚ÄîI have no place to sleep myself, Stephen informed him.
Corley, at the first go-off, was inclined to suspect it was something to do with Stephen being fired out of his digs for bringing in a bloody tart off the street. There was a dosshouse in Marlborough street, Mrs Maloney's, but it was only a tanner touch and full of undesirables but M'Conachie told him you got a decent enough do in the Brazen Head over in Winetavern street (which was distantly suggestive to the person addressed of friar Bacon) for a bob. He was starving too though he hadn't said a word about it.
Though this sort of thing went on every other night or very near it still Stephen's feelings got the better of him in a sense though he knew that Corley's brandnew rigmarole, on a par with the others, was hardly deserving of much credence. However, haud ignarus malorum miseris succurrere disco, etcetera, as the Latin poet remarks, especially as luck would have it he got paid his screw after every middle of the month on the sixteenth which was the date of the month as a matter of fact though a good bit of the wherewithal was demolished. But the cream of the joke was nothing would get it Out of Corley's head that he was living in affluence and hadn't a thing to do but hand out the needful - whereas. He put his hand in a pocket anyhow, not with the idea of finding any food there, but thinking he might lend him anything up to a bob or so in lieu so that he might endeavour at all events and get sufficient to eat. But the result was in the negative for, to his chagrin, he found his cash missing. A few broken biscuits were all the result of his investigation. He tried his hardest to recollect for the moment whether he had lost, as well he might have, or left, because in that contingency it was not a pleasant lookout, very much the reverse, in fact. He was altogether too fagged out to institute a thorough search though he tried to recollect about biscuits he dimly remembered. Who now exactly gave them, or where was, or did he buy? However, in another pocket he came across what he surmised in the dark were pennies, erroneously, however, as it turned out.
‚ÄîThose are halfcrowns, man, Corley corrected him.
And so in point of fact they turned out to be. Stephen lent him one of them.
‚ÄîThanks, Corley answered. You're a gentleman. I'll pay you back some time. Who's that with you? I saw him a few times in the Bleeding Horse in Camden street with Boylan the billsticker. You might put in a good word for us to get me taken on there. I'd carry a sandwichboard only the girl in the office told me they're full up for the next three weeks, man. God, you've to book ahead, man, you'd think it was for the Carl Rosa. I don't give a shite anyway so long as I get a job even as a crossing sweeper.
Subsequently, being not quite so down in the mouth after the two-and-six he got, he informed Stephen about a fellow by the name of Bags Comisky that he said Stephen knew well out of Fullam's, the shipchandler's bookkeeper there, that used to be often round in Nagle's back with O'Mara and a little chap with a stutter the name of Tighe. Anyhow, he was lagged the night before last and fined ten bob for a drunk and disorderly and refusing to go with the constable.
Mr Bloom in the meanwhile kept dodging about in the vicinity of the cobblestones near the brazier of coke in front of the corporation watchman's sentrybox, who, evidently a glutton for work, it struck him, was having a quiet forty winks for all intents and purposes on his own private account while Dublin slept. He threw an odd eye at the same time now and then at Stephen's anything but immaculately attired interlocutor as if he had seen that nobleman somewhere or other though where he was not in a position to truthfully state nor had he the remotest idea when. Being a levelheaded individual who could give points to not a few in point of shrewd observation, he also remarked on his very dilapidated hat and slouchy wearing apparel generally, testifying to a chronic impecuniosity. Probably he was one of his hangerson but for the matter of that it was merely a question of one preying on his next door neighbour all round, in every deep, so to put it, a deeper depth and for the matter of that if the man in the street chanced to be in the dock himself penal servitude, with or without the option of a fine, would be a very rara avis altogether. In any case he had a consummate amount of cool assurance intercepting people at that hour of the night or morning. Pretty thick that was certainly.
The pair parted company and Stephen rejoined Mr Bloom, who, with his practised eye, was not without perceiving that he had succumbed to the blandiloquence of the other parasite. Alluding to the encounter he said, laughingly, Stephen, that is:
‚ÄîHe's down on his luck. He asked me to ask you to ask somebody named Boylan, a billsticker, to give him a job as a sandwichman.
At this intelligence, in which he seemingly evinced little interest, Mr Bloom gazed abstractedly for the space of a half a second or so in the direction of a bucket dredger, rejoicing in the farfamed name of Eblana, moored alongside Customhouse Quay and quite possibly Out of repair, whereupon he observed evasively:
‚ÄîEverybody gets their own ration of luck, they say. Now you mention it his face was familiar to me. But leaving that for the moment, how much did you part with, he queried, if I am not too inquisitive?
‚ÄîHalf-a-crown, Stephen responded. I daresay he needs it to sleep somewhere.
‚ÄîNeeds, Mr Bloom ejaculated, professing not the least surprise at the intelligence, I can quite credit the assertion and I guarantee he invariably does. Everyone according to his needs and everyone according to his deeds. But talking about things in general, where, added he with a smile, will you sleep yourself? Walking to Sandycove is Out of the question and, even supposing you did, you won't get in after what occurred at Westland Row station. Simply fag out there for nothing. I don't mean to presume to dictate to you in the slightest degree but why did you leave your father's house?
‚ÄîTo seek misfortune, was Stephen's answer.
‚ÄîI met your respected father on a recent occasion, Mr Bloom diplomatically returned. Today, in fact, or, to be strictly accurate, on yesterday. Where does he live at present? I gathered in the course of conversation that he had moved.
‚ÄîI believe he is in Dublin somewhere, Stephen answered unconcernedly. Why?
‚ÄîA gifted man, Mr Bloom said of Mr Dedalus senior, in more respects than one and a born raconteur if ever there was one. He takes great pride, quite legitimately, Out of you. You could go back, perhaps, he hazarded, still thinking of the very unpleasant scene at Westland Row terminus when it was perfectly evident that the other two, Mulligan, that is, and that English tourist friend of his, who eventually euchred their third companion, were patently trying, as if the whole bally station belonged to them, to give Stephen the slip in the confusion.
There was no response forthcoming to the suggestion, however, such as it was, Stephen's mind's eye being too busily engaged in repicturing his family hearth the last time he saw it, with his sister, Dilly, sitting by the ingle, her hair hanging down, waiting for some weak Trinidad shell cocoa that was in the sootcoated kettle to be done so that she and he could drink it with the oatmeal water for milk after the Friday herrings they had eaten at two a penny, with an egg apiece for Maggy, Boody and Katey, the cat meanwhile under the mangle devouring a mess of eggshells and charred fish heads and bones on a square of brown paper in accordance with the third precept of the church to fast and abstain on the days commanded, it being quarter tense or, if not, ember days or something like that.
‚ÄîNo, Mr Bloom repeated again, I wouldn't personally repose much trust in that boon companion of yours who contributes the humorous element, Dr Mulligan, as a guide, philosopher, and friend, if I were in your shoes. He knows which side his bread is buttered on though in all probability he never realised what it is to be without regular meals. Of course you didn't notice as much as I did but it wouldn't occasion me the least surprise to learn that a pinch of tobacco or some narcotic was put in your drink for some ulterior object.
He understood, however, from all he heard, that Dr Mulligan was a versatile allround man, by no means confined to medicine only, who was rapidly coming to the fore in his line and, if the report was verified, bade fair to enjoy a flourishing practice in the not too distant future as a tony medical practitioner drawing a handsome fee for his services in addition to which professional status his rescue of that man from certain drowning by artificial respiration and what they call first aid at Skerries, or Malahide was it? was, he was bound to admit, an exceedingly plucky deed which he could not too highly praise, so that frankly he was utterly at a loss to fathom what earthly reason could be at the back of it except he put it down to sheer cussedness or jealousy, pure and simple.
‚ÄîExcept it simply amounts to one thing and he is what they call picking your brains, he ventured to throw out.
The guarded glance of half solicitude, half curiosity, augmented by friendliness, which he gave at Stephen's at present morose expression of features did not throw a flood of light, none at all in fact, on the problem as to whether he had let himself be badly bamboozled, to judge by two or three low spirited remarks he let drop, or, the other way about, saw through the affair, and, for some reason or other best known to himself, allowed matters to more or less... Grinding poverty did have that effect and he more than conjectured that, high educational abilities though he possessed, he experienced no little difficulty in making both ends meet.
Adjacent to the men's public urinal he perceived an icecream car round which a group of presumably Italians in heated altercation were getting rid of voluble expressions in their vivacious language in a particularly animated way, there being some little differences between the parties.
‚ÄîPutana madonna, che ci dia i quattrini! Ho ragione? Culo rotto!
‚ÄîIntendiamoci. Mezzo sovrano pi√π
‚ÄîDice lui, pero.
‚ÄîFarabutto! Mortacci sui!
Mr Bloom and Stephen entered the cabman's shelter, an unpretentious wooden structure, where, prior to then, he had rarely, if ever, been before; the former having previously whispered to the latter a few hints anent the keeper of it, said to be the once famous Skin-the-Goat, Fitzharris, the invincible, though he wouldn't vouch for the actual facts, which quite possibly there was not one vestige of truth in. A few moments later saw our two noctambules safely seated in a discreet corner, only to be greeted by stares from the decidedly miscellaneous collection of waifs and strays and other nondescript specimens of the genus homo, already there engaged in eating and drinking, diversified by conversation, for whom they seemingly formed an object of marked curiosity.
‚ÄîNow touching a cup of coffee, Mr Bloom ventured to plausibly suggest to break the ice, it occurs to me you ought to sample something in the shape of solid food, say a roll of some description.
Accordingly his first act was with characteristic sangfroid to order these commodities quietly. The hoi polloi of jarvies or stevedores, or whatever they were, after a cursory examination, turned their eyes, apparently dissatisfied, away, though one redbearded bibulous individual, a portion of whose hair was greyish, a sailor, probably, still stared for some appreciable time before transferring his rapt attention to the floor.
Mr Bloom, availing himself of the right of free speech, he having just a bowing acquaintance with the language in dispute though, to be sure, rather in a quandary over voglio, remarked to his prot√©g√© in an audible tone of voice, apropos of the battle royal in the street which was still raging fast and furious:
‚ÄîBeautiful language. I mean for singing purposes. Why do you not write your poetry in that language? Bella Poetria! it is so melodious and full. Belladonna voglio.
Stephen, who was trying his dead best to yawn, if he could, suffering from dead lassitude generally, replied:
‚ÄîTo fill the ear of a cow elephant. They were haggling over money.
‚ÄîIs that so? Mr Bloom asked. Of course, he subjoined pensively, at the inward reflection of there being more languages to start with than were absolutely necessary, it may be only the southern glamour that surrounds it.
The keeper of the shelter in the middle of this t√™te-√†-t√™te put a boiling swimming cup of a choice concoction labelled coffee on the table and a rather antediluvian specimen of a bun, or so it seemed, after which he beat a retreat to his counter. Mr Bloom determining to have a good square look at him later on so as not to appear to... for which reason he encouraged Stephen to proceed with his eyes while he did the honours by surreptitiously pushing the cup of what was temporarily supposed to be called coffee gradually nearer him.
‚ÄîSounds are impostures, Stephen said after a pause of some little time. Like names, Cicero, Podmore, Napoleon, Mr Goodbody, Jesus, Mr Doyle. Shakespeares were as common as Murphies. What's in a name?
‚ÄîYes, to be sure, Mr Bloom unaffectedly concurred. Of course. Our name was changed too, he added, pushing the socalled roll across.
The redbearded sailor, who had his weather eye on the newcomers, boarded Stephen, whom he had singled out for attention in particular, squarely by asking:
‚ÄîAnd what might your name be?
Just in the nick of time Mr Bloom touched his companion's boot but Stephen, apparently disregarding the warm pressure, from an unexpected quarter, answered:
‚ÄîDedalus.
The sailor stared at him heavily from a pair of drowsy baggy eyes, rather bunged up from excessive use of boose, preferably good old Hollands and water.
‚ÄîYou know Simon Dedalus? he asked at length.
‚ÄîI've heard of him, Stephen said.
Mr Bloom was all at sea for a moment, seeing the others evidently eavesdropping too.
‚ÄîHe's Irish, the seaman bold affirmed, staring still in much the same way and nodding. All Irish.
‚ÄîAll too Irish, Stephen rejoined.
As for Mr Bloom he could neither make head or tail of the whole business and he was just asking himself what possible connection when the sailor, of his own accord, turned to the other Occupants of the shelter with the remark: I seen him shoot two eggs off two bottles at fifty yards over his shoulder. The left hand dead shot.
Though he was slightly hampered by an occasional stammer and his gestures being also clumsy as it was still he did his best to explain.
‚ÄîBottle Out there, say. Fifty yards measured. Eggs on the bottles. Cocks his gun over his shoulder. Aims.
He turned his body half round, shut up his right eye completely, then he screwed his features up some way sideways and glared out into the night with an unprepossessing cast of countenance.
‚ÄîPom, he then shouted once.
The entire audience waited, anticipating an additional detonation, there being still a further egg.
‚ÄîPom, he shouted twice.
Egg two evidently demolished, he nodded and winked, adding bloodthirstily:
Buffalo Bill shoots to kill,
Never missed nor he never will.
A silence ensued till Mr Bloom for agreeableness' sake just felt like asking him whether it was for a marksmanship competition like the Bisley.
‚ÄîBeg pardon, the sailor said.
‚ÄîLong ago? Mr Bloom pursued without flinching a hairsbreadth.
‚ÄîWhy, the sailor replied, relaxing to a certain extent under the magic influence of diamond cut diamond, it might be a matter of ten years. He toured the wide world with Hengler's Royal Circus. I seen him do that in Stockholm.
‚ÄîCurious coincidence, Mr Bloom confided to Stephen unobtrusively.
‚ÄîMurphy's my name, the sailor continued, W. B. Murphy, of Carrigaloe. Know where that is?
‚ÄîQueenstown Harbour, Stephen replied.
‚ÄîThat's right, the sailor said. Fort Camden and Fort Carlisle. That's where I hails from. My little woman's down there. She's waiting for me, I know. For England, home and beauty. She's my own true wife I haven't seen for seven years now, sailing about.
Mr Bloom could easily picture his advent on this scene - the homecoming to the mariner's roadside shieling after having diddled Davy Jones - a rainy night with a blind moon. Across the world for a wife. Quite a number of stories there were on that particular Alice Ben Bolt topic, Enoch Arden and Rip van Winkle and does anybody hereabouts remember Caoc O'Leary, a favourite and most trying declamation piece, by the way, of poor John Casey and a bit of perfect poetry in its own small way? Never about the runaway wife coming back, however much devoted to the absentee. The face at the window! Judge of his astonishment when he finally did breast the tape and the awful truth dawned upon him anent his better half, wrecked in his affections. You little expected me but I've come to stay and make a fresh start. There she sits, a grass widow, at the selfsame fireside. Believes me dead. Rocked in the cradle of the deep. And there sits uncle Chubb or Tomkin, as the case might be, the publican of the Crown and Anchor, in shirtsleeves, eating rumpsteak and onions. No chair for father. Boo! The wind! Her brandnew arrival is on her knee, post mortem child. With a high ro! and a randy ro! and my galloping tearing tandy O! Bow to the inevitable. Grin and bear it. I remain with much love your brokenhearted husband, W. B. Murphy.
The sailor, who scarcely seemed to be a Dublin resident, turned to one of the jarvies with the request:
‚ÄîYou don't happen to have such a thing as a spare chaw about you, do you?
The jarvey addressed, as it happened, had not but the keeper took a die of plug from his good jacket hanging on a nail and the desired object was passed from hand to hand.
‚ÄîThank you, the sailor said.
He deposited the quid in his gob and, chewing, and with some slow stammers, proceeded:
‚ÄîWe come up this morning eleven o'clock. The threemaster Rosevean from Bridgwater with bricks. I shipped to get over. Paid off this afternoon. There's my discharge. See? W. B. Murphy, A. B. S.
In confirmation of which statement he extricated from an inside pocket and handed to his neighbours a not very clean looking folded document.
‚ÄîYou must have seen a fair share of the world, the keeper remarked, leaning on the counter.
‚ÄîWhy, the sailor answered, upon reflection upon it, I've circumnavigated a bit since I first joined on. I was in the Red Sea. I was in China and North America and South America. I seen icebergs plenty, growlers. I was in Stockholm and the Black Sea, the Dardanelles, under Captain Dalton the best bloody man that ever scuttled a ship. I seen Russia. Gospodi pomilooy. That's how the Russians prays.
‚ÄîYou seen queer sights, don't be talking, put in a jarvey.
‚ÄîWhy, the sailor said, shifting his partially chewed plug, I seen queer things too, ups and downs. I seen a crocodile bite the fluke of an anchor same as I chew that quid.
He took out of his mouth the pulpy quid and, lodging it between his teeth, bit ferociously.
‚ÄîKhaan! Like that. And I seen maneaters in Peru that eats corpses and the livers of horses. Look here. Here they are. A friend of mine sent me.
He fumbled out a picture postcard from his inside pocket, which seemed to be in its way a species of repository, and pushed it along the table. The printed matter on it stated: Choza de Indios. Beni, Bolivia.
All focused their attention on the scene exhibited, at a group of savage women in striped loincloths, squatted, blinking, suckling, frowning, sleeping, amid a swarm of infants (there must have been quite a score of them) outside some primitive shanties of osier.
‚ÄîChews coca all day long, the communicative tarpaulin added. Stomachs like breadgraters. Cuts off their diddies when they can't bear no more children. See them there stark ballocknaked eating a dead horse's liver raw.
His postcard proved a centre of attraction for Messrs the greenhorns for several minutes, if not more.
‚ÄîKnow how to keep them off? he inquired genially.
Nobody volunteering a statement, he winked, saying:
‚ÄîGlass. That boggles 'em. Glass.
Mr Bloom, without evincing surprise, unostentatiously turned over the card to peruse the partially obliterated address and postmark. It ran as follows: Tarjeta Postal. Se√±or A. Boudin, Galeria Becche, Santiago, Chile. There was no message evidently, as he took particular notice. Though not an implicit believer in the lurid story narrated (or the eggsniping transaction for that matter despite William Tell and the Lazarillo-Don Cesar de Bazan incident depicted in Maritana on which occasion the former's ball passed through the latter's hat), having detected a discrepancy between his name (assuming he was the person he represented himself to be and not sailing under false colours after having boxed the compass on the strict q.t. somewhere) and the fictitious addressee of the missive which made him nourish some suspicions of our friend's bona fides, nevertheless it reminded him in a way of a longcherished plan he meant to one day realise some Wednesday or Saturday of travelling to London via long sea not to say that he had ever travelled extensively to any great extent but he was at heart a born adventurer though by a trick of fate he had consistently remained a landlubber except you call going to Holyhead which was his longest.

crawls up the screen -- with Narrator.
NARRATOR
In May 1980, Fidel Castro -- in an effort to normalize relations with the Carter Administration -- opened the harbor at Mariel, Cuba with the apparent intention of letting some of his people join their relatives in the United States. Within seventy-two hours, 3,000 U.S. boats were headed for Cuba. In the next few weeks, it became evident that Castro was forcing the boat owners to carry back with them not only their relatives but the dregs of his jail population. By the time the port was closed 125,000 'Marielitos' had landed in Florida. An estimated 25,000 had criminal records. This is the story of that minority -- those they call 'Los Bandidos.'
The prologue is shredded diagonally by the blade of a
stiletto and in the empty black void we:

the scar-faced one, in the young angry prime of his life.
We dwell first on the scar which he likes to scratch now and
then. We move to the eyes, pure in their fury. Finally we
encompass the face -- the face of a man about to explode --
muscle, tissue, brain -- a man willing to live or die and
on the increment of a moment, inflict or receive either one.
He is clothed in rags crossed with holes, his shoes broken
cardboard, his hair unkempt, his complexion sallow from
prison.
Over this:

Okay so what do you call yourself?
VOICE #2 (o.s.)
Como se llama?
MONTANA
Tony Montana...you?

Where'd you learn to speak the English, Tony?
MONTANA
My old man -- he was American. Sailor. Bum.
I always know, y'know, one day I gonna come to America.
I see all the movies...

So where's your old man now?
MONTANA
He's dead. He died. Somewhere...
VOICE #1
Mother?
TONY
She's dead too.
VOICE #2
What kind of work you do in Cuba, Tony?
TONY
This. That. The Army. Some construction work....

TONY

Nobody. Everybody's dead.
MAN #I
Y'ever been in jail, Tony?
TONY
Me jail? No way.
We now reveal three men in civilian clothing in the dark afternoon light of the little room. Actually it's a plywood office somewhere in the processing hall and we hear the din from the hall over the question and answer. Two of the men sit around a desk, the Third Man stands in a corner, staring at Tony, the most authoritative-looking of the three.
MAN #l
(checking off a list)
You been in a mental hospital, Tony?
TONY
(grinning)
Yeah, in the boat coming over.
MAN #1
How 'bout homosexuality, Tony? You like men, y'like to dress up like a woman?
TONY
(to Man #2)
Never tried it. What the fuck's wrong with this guy, what's he think I am?
MAN #2
Just answer the questions, Tony.
The voices of the men remain cool and collected throughout.
TONY
(to Man #1)
Fuck no.
MAN #1
Arrested? Vagrancy? Marijuana?
TONY
NO. ...NO. Never. Nothing.
His eye movements are rapid (over shoulders, sides, doors)
and he does a lot of touching -- objects -- lightly with the
tips of the fingers. Man #3 is stepping forward out of the
shadows.
MAN #3
So where'd you get the beauty scar?
TONY
This?..
(scratching the scar, shrugs)
I was a kid. You should see the other kid.

MAN #3
And this?
He holds up Tony's hand and indicates the tattoo between the
thumb and second finger -- a heart with the word ""Madre""
scaled through it.
TONY
Oh that was for my sweetheart.
MAN #3
Sweetheart?
(to the other men)
We been seeing more and more of these. It's some kinda code these guys used in the can. Pitchfork means an assassin
or something. This one's new... You want to tell us, Montana or you want to take a little trip to the detention center?
TONY
Hey, so I was in the can once for buying dollars. Big deal.

That's pretty funny, Tony.
TONY

Hey, so I fuck Castro, what's it to you? You a Communist or something?
How would you like it they tell you all the time what to think, what to do, you wanna be like a sheep, like everybody else. Baa baa? Puta! You want a stoolie on every block? You wanna work eight hours a day and you never own nothing? I ate octopus three times a day, fucking octopus is coming out my ears, fuckin' Russian shoes are eating through my feet. Whaddaya want? You want me to stay there? Hey, I'm no little whore, I'm no stinking thief! I'm Tony Montana and I'm a political prisoner here from Cuba and I want my fucking 'Human Rights' just like President Jimmy Carter says, okay?
Silence.
There's a certain eloquence to the man`s plea but
it falls on disbelieving ears. One of them chuckles.

Manny (Manolo) Ribera's got his feet up on an empty seat.
He's big, strong, handsome, with dashing darkly feminine

He's eating a Baby Ruth candy bar.
MANNY
Seat's taken.
TONY
So I'll sit in your lap.
Tony pushes his feet off, sits. He takes the Baby Ruth out
of Manny's hand, peels out the bar of chocolate, then
returns the empty wrapper to Manny,
TONY
So what'd you tell them?
MANNY
I told them what you told me to tell them. I told them I was in sanitation in Cuba.
TONY
I didn't tell you sanitation. I told you to tell them you was in a sanitarium, not sanitation.
The bus pulling out now.
MANNY
Is that what you told me? You didn't tell me that.
TONY
You know if you hadn't opened your mouth, they woulda thought you were a horse. I told you to tell them you had TB and was cured.

The rag-tag audience is noisily yammering back at the screen,
the camera moving past Manny Ray, chewing gum, hair slicked,
eyes in cat-like repose... to Tony, enrapt, eyes like an eleven year old, mouth hanging open.
BOGART
What a thing.
Conscience. Conscience.
If you believe you've got a conscience, it`ll pester you to death. But if you don't believe you've got one, what can it do to you? Makes me sick so much talking and fussing about nonsense.

Tony is moving down 23rd Street, the walk proud and jungle
in the rock of the hips and the cast of the shoulders --
now accompanied by his handsome compadre, Manny.
TONY
That Bogart, Chico, hunh?
MANNY
Fucking crazy, hunh!
TONY
That gold dust blowing in the wind.
Y'see Manny, he's always looking over his shoulder. Hunh? Like me....
He hunches, darting exaggerated looks over his shoulder,
imitating Bogart. Manny laughs. In his black shirt with
zig-zag dots and colors and the baggy pants and sunglasses,
Tony's starting to look American. He's even got himself a
pop button pinned to his shirt that says ""Fuck Off and Die.""
And his English rolls faster off his tongue, his confidence
more pronounced.
TONY
. . . don't trust nobody.
MANNY
Yeah all that gold, hunh -- I guess you get so crazy you never trust nobody no more.
TONY
Never happen to me, Chico. That's one thing I never gonna be. I never gonna be crazy like that.
MANNY
Yeah, how do you know....
TONY
I know.
MANNY
I don't know. Sometimes you crazy, too, Tony.
TONY
Assholes, I go crazy. You Manny, I never go crazy with you. You're
like my brother, I love you!
MANNY
Yeah, sure.
TONY
Hey, c'mon.
Tony playfully punches Manny and they walk on into the humid night, intersecting a young punk, Chi-Chi.
CHI-CHI

Hey Manny.
MANNY
Oye Chi-Chi, what's going down.
CHI-CHI
Usual shit. Want some peanuts? Pago's carrying tonight.
MANNY
I don't know, I get all fucked up on it....
CHI-CHI
Want some new snatch? A pussycat
name of Yolanda just rolled onto the
Boulevard ---
MANNY
Oh yeah, what she look like?
CHI-CHI
She look like you 'cept she got a snatch.
MANNY
A real snatch?
CHI-CHI
You're not kidding. It talks.
As they chatter, Tony moves on with a movement of the head
for Manny. ""Later.""
He's in the middle of the ""Boulevard"" where a bustling black
market in toiletries, clothing, cigarettes, and transvestites is conducted nightly in the harsh glare of barrack neon.
He ambles past a bunch of young guys throwing a Frisbee,
past a ""Viva Carter!"" proclamation in graffiti....

10 EXT. FREEDOMTOWN GROUNDS - NIGHT 10
Tony, five minutes later, in a phone booth, in the middle of a bank of them, dozens of Marielietos pressing to get in, trying still to contact somebody -- anybody -- on the outside.
Tony is dialing, his eyes shifting down to the telephone
number written in pencil on the back of a snapshot- As he
finishes the number, he flips the snapshot over and we see
a young girl, about thirteen years old, dark, tiny, fiery,
standing together with a dog and Tony, early twenties, in
shadow, the fringes of the photo heavily tattered with
handling. Tony stares at it, his mind drifting as the phone
rings in a distant place. A brief moment of repose we have
not yet seen in Tony.
Someone picks up the phone. An older woman's Voice. His
expression alters to uncertainty.
VOICE
Yes? ...Hello? ...Who is this?
Tony changes his mind, hangs up. Pause. The faces of those
in line peer in, the next party raps on the door, but Tony
ignores it, slips the snapshot back into the wallet in his
pants, then at his own pace, exits the phone booth.
He walks a few beats, his eyes pensive. Then recognizes
somebody in another phone booth and goes over.
Angel Fernandez has got the face of one, as he argues on
the phone, then hangs up, a desolate look on his face, a
worn phone book in his hand.
TONY
Angel, how ya doin'?
ANGEL
You know how many goddamn Fernandezes are living in fucking Union City? And I gotta call every fucking one of 'em to find my brother!
TONY
(in passing)
Don't waste your dime, Chico. You know your brother hates you.
ANGEL
Go fuck yourself, Tony.
Manny catches up to Tony.
TONY
Whatcha hanging around with that hustler for?
MANNY
Hey Chi-Chi's okay, he hears things,
TONY
What's he hear I don't hear.
Angel comes over, listens.
MANNY
He hears we got problems. Immigration is having these hearings, y ' know? And they're saying nine out of ten of us is gonna get shipped back!
TONY
Oh yeah?
MANNY
Yeah. And a lotta shit just went down at Indiantown Gap. In Pennsylvania. Riots, fires, broken heads... things are gonna pop here.
TONY
Shit, I coulda told you that.
MANNY
Yeah, so what do you think the immigration's gonna do when we riot? You think they're gonna let us out? They're gonna throw away the key, that's what.
ANGEL
Oh shit!
MANNY
What's I say. This is gonna end bad, muchachos....
TONY
Hey, I tell you guys this isn't Cuba here, this is the United States. They got nothing but lawyers here. We're on the television. We're in the newspapers. Whatta they gonna do -- ship us back to Cuba? Castro-- he don't want us. Nobody no place wants us so whatta they gonna do -- put us in a gas chamber so all the people can see? They're stuck with us, Chico -- they gotta let us go!
MANNY
Yeah, well, what if we gotta sit here another six months, hunh?
TONY
You worry too much, mi hermano. Like the man says, 'when you got 'em by the balls, their hearts and minds gonna follow' --hunh?
Tony winks and walks off.
The radio is playing hard rock, something like Blondie or Benatar from the stoop of a nearby barrack. Tony loves the sound and swings into it, snapping his fingers and rolling his hips like Presley. He back-peddles, smiling at Manny and Angel.
TONY
(in awful imitation)
'Oh yeah America! Love-to love you baby, oh yeah!'
CUT TO
11 EXT. PLAYING FIELD - DAY - TWO WEEKS LATER

Camera on Tony shuffling and feinting a soccer ball in an impromptu game; he's covered with sweat, tires a fancy move
around a younger kid who not only steals the ball away off him but manages to lay him flat on his face.
TONY
(lying there)
Aw fuck....
The game, leaving him behind, shifts downfield.
MANNY
Aye ! Tony! C'mon!
Manny, just arrived at the edge of the field, waves him off.
Tony, getting up, brushing himself off, walks off the field
towards him.
ANGEL
(at a distance)
Hey Tony where ya going?
TONY
I got better things to do.
ANGEL
Chicken liver, hunh?
TONY
(to Manny)
Yeah?
(looking zd)
Let's walk.
They walk.
MANNY
You ready for the good news, cone?
TONY
Yeah.
MANNY
We can be outta here in thirty days.
Not only that. We got a green card and a job in Miami! Hunh? We're made, Chico, we're made?
TONY
Yeah, whadda we gotta do, go to Cuba and hit the Beard or what?
Angel is walking towards them. Tony signals him.
MANNY
(shakes his head)
Forget it. Oh yeah -- there's a hundred greenbacks in it, For both of us.
TONY
(enthusiastic)
Hey you're kidding, that's great!
But Manny, you tell your guys Angel gets out with us.
As Rebenga, in long-lensed closeup, nervously smokes a
cigarette, eyes roving as the guard examines his papers.
CUT TO
13 MONTAGE - THE RIOT - FREEDOMTOWN - DAY
The visuals are swift, dispassionate and documentary-like.
The refugees storm the barbed wire at the main gate,
carrying bricks and wooden slats.
ALL
(in unison)
Libertad! Libertad!
14 NATIONAL GUARDSMEN AND STATE POLICE
form ranks outside.
15 REFUGEES
flee through a hole in the fence.
16 GUARDS
move on them, wielding clubs.
17 SEVERAL REFUGEES
are scooting down a highway.
18 POLICE DOGS
on chains are glimpsed.
19 REFUGEES
throw stones and debris from the rooftop of a barrack.
20 REBENGA
a cigarette in his mouth, nervously hurries into a barrack.
21 ANGEL
tracks him, signals....
22 INSIDE - REFUGEES
are pulling apart their beds, going for the wooden slats.
Others set fire to their mattresses.
23 THE POLICE AND GUARDS
are moving through the gates, restoring order. Loudspeakers
blast. Injured refugees lie bleeding on the grounds.
24 AN ENTIRE BARRACK
now goes up in flames.
25 INSIDE THE BARRACK
A bewildered Emilio Rebenga grabs his papers and valuables.
Manny runs up on him.
Rebenga sees him, senses danger, flees down the aisle with his satchel, intersecting other panicked refugees.
Manny follows.
Rebenga stumbles into a bed frame, shatters his glasses,
then runs on. Into the smoke and flame. Out of which Scarface now appears -- in his killing wrath.
TONY
Rebenga!
Rebenga snaps to the sound of the voice.
TONY
(Spanish)
From the friends you fucked!
The work is fast. The stiletto punches nine quick holes in his lungs and his heart...  And the figure of death is gone.
...And Emilio Rebenga staggers wildly in the smoke, uncomprehending eyes encased in broken glasses. Sinking out of frame.
26 EXT. FREEDOMTOWN - DAY
The riot is over. The grounds are still, smoke and debris the aftermath.
DISSOLVE TO
27 INT. PROCESSING ROOM - DAY - A MONTH LATER
An Immigration Officer passes a sheaf of documents across a desk into a pair of hands. The camera gliding along a Green Card pinned to the top of the stack.
It says ""ANTHONY MONTANA"" and it has picture and stamps. It's official, as the camera moves with triumphant immigration theme music to the face of Mr. Montana examining quite contentedly the rewards of his efforts.
End of montage. Music continues.
DISSOLVE TO
27-A EXT. DOWNTOWN MIAMI - SUNNY DAY
The new Miami is rising ubiquitously above Biscayne Bay,
the camera moving past blossoming skyscrapers, workmen,
huge cranes, glass, mirrors booming upwards into a
beautiful blue Florida sky, fleeced with perfectly white
clouds... past a giant billboard:
HOW ABOUT A MILLION DOLLAR LOAN?
COME TALK TO US...
AT THE BANCO DE MIAMI...
TODAY!
Past banks of glass (Caribank, Banco de Venezuela, Amerifirst)...
Insert a car sticker going by with the image of the American flag and the reminder: ""Will the last American leaving Miami please bring flag?""
Tony and Manny bop along the street in their hand-me-down
clothes, oogling the chicas and the bodegas (in a plush
modern area of Miami). Boats. Buildings. Cars.
TONY
(looking around)
Boy -- can you believe this place, Chico?
MANNY
(Spanish)
Man, they weren't kidding around.
TONY
(pointing to a little old man walking towards them)
See that old guy over there?
MANNY
Yeah.
TONY
Millionaire.
MANNY
How do you know?
TONY
Go over there. Ask him gimme some money. He'll give you the silver right outta his pants -- that's America man, that's what they do here.
MANNY
(almost believing)
Yeah? Hey Tony catch this tomato.
(adjusting his pants)
Ooooh baby doll...
A hot Cuban girl in heels comes down the sidewalk towards
them with a female friend.
TONY
Hey baby what you say?
She looks at him like he was the last thing in the world
she'd say anything to.
Tony waves her off, then changes his mind and runs up
behind her and throws up her skirt and peeks at her ass.
Before she can react, he hops away laughing as the two
Cuban girls ad-lib Spanish expletives at him.
MANNY
Hey that's not cool, man. You wanna score one of these chicks, watch me. Mira!
He wiggles his tongue up and down, fast like a small
whirring motor part, then slips it back into his mouth in
the flick of an eye.
TONY
...the fuck was that?
MANNY
You didn't see it? You weren't looking. Hey you gotta watch for it.
Does it again, quickly; it looks like a baby robin's head
peeking out of a nest in his teeth, then it's gone.
TONY
What the hell's that for -- eating bugs? That's disgustin'.
MANNY
You think so hunh? Well you don't know shit 'bout chicks Chico. When they see this, they know. They go crazy. They don't resist me.
Does it again. Tony tries but lacks the speed and agility, provoking Manny's laughter. Many double checks himself in a shop window.
MANNY
(doing it again)
Takes practice, mi sangre, but they just love it when you flop that pussy with it....
TONY
Oooh... cono! How 'bout that one?
Pointing to a tall, cool blonde across the avenue.
MANNY
No problem.
27-B EXT. MIAMI SHOPPING STREET - DAY
Tony walks right out into the avenue, sticking out his arm
and stopping traffic. Cars honk angrily but he couldn't
give a shit.
TONY
Come on?
Manny follows as Tony now moves across the opposite lane, a
car screeching to a halt in front of him.
TONY
(points)
Okay Rober Retfor, strut your stuff.
The blonde has paused to look in a shop window.
Manny stops alongside, pretends to look. When he catches
her eyes, he flicks his tongue.
She looks at him, confused, then back into the window.
Manny look back at Tony, winks, sidles closer to her.
Tony, waiting off to the side, catches the gaze of a somber
child, four, toddling along with it's mom. He makes his
own version of a funny face at the kid who looks back at
him puzzled. Tony produces another face. The kid now
smiles. The mother looks over. Tony shrugs. She smiles
and moves along.
Meanwhile, Manny has moved close to the blonde and suggests something, his eyebrows raising, the smile crooked. It takes a moment, then the blonde smacks him across the face
and walks away.
Tony walks over to him, mocking.
TONY
Pobre hijo de puta -- you got it all mixed up.
This country first you gotta get the money, then you get
the power and when you got the power, then you get the women -- and then, Chico, you got the world by the balls. Por los conjones.
MANNY
There you go talking big again man. You don't know shit about the world. Who was it got us the green card, who got us the friends with the connections, hunh -- who's getting us a job? You or me? Not you man. You lucky you have any friends. You lucky to have me as a friend....
As they walk off, backs to camera.
TONY
Yeah, so where's this job?
MANNY
Don't push man, my friends gonna take care of everything.
CUT TO
28 LITTLE HAVANA RESTAURANT - LITTLE HAVANA - NIGHT
on Southwest 8th Street. ""Calle Ocho""....
The parking lot is crammed with Moby Dick-size cars and
casual Cubans in sports clothes bunched in conversations
around their wheels or at the ice cream stand.
The inside is a brightly lit glitterdome with fancy mirrors and chandelier effects, Spanish in influence, and every table is taken. It combines the social functions of a family restaurant, cafe, tourist haunt and late-night watering hole for various beasts of prey.
The waitresses move like well-oiled troops along the paths
to the kitchen, turning the tables at a speedy rate. The
camera following past the pots and the pans and the steam
and the yelling cooks -- to the deepest, darkest recess of
this dungeon....
. . . To reveal Tony Montana stubbing grease off the pots and
Manny Ray washing a stack of dishes. They're filthy and
exhausted. A dish slips through Manny's fingers and crashes
to the floor. A look between them suffices to tell us all.
TONY
Your big shot friend better come up with something soon. I didn't come to America to break my fucking back, querido.
MANNY
(equally irritated)
Hey he's coming okay! What do you want?
CUT TO
29 INT./EXT. LITTLE HAVANA RESTAURANT - NIGHT - HOURS LATER
We are looking through a cubbyhole at the diners. Young
Cuban guys with chiquitas drift in with their fancy clothes,
diamonds and -- the mark of status -- large bodyguards.
They're out front with the flash, shaking hands with friends, kissing, talking loud, familiar with the waitresses.
Staring through the smeared window enrapt are Tony and
Manny, wiping the sweat off their faces with towels.
MANNY
Look at that chick man, wow! Look at them knockers.
TONY
Yeah, look at the punk with her.
What's he got that I don't got?
MANNY
He's good-looking that's what, look at his clothes, flash Chico, pizzazz! A little coke money don't hurt nobody...
TONY
Junkie! -- They got no fuckin' character.
(looks at his hands)
Cono! Look at these... fucking Onions! They outta be picking gold off the streets.
His hands are shriveled white from dishwater.
COOK
(Spanish)
Hey you two, outside! You got company...
MANNY
That's him -- El Mono's here!
TONY
(contemptuous of the name)
El Mono? Shit....
CUT TO
30 EXT. PARKING LOT OUTSIDE LITTLE HAVANA RESTAURANT - NIGHT
Omar Suarez (El Mono -- ""The Monkey"") is so named cause he
looks like one. Nervous, crooked, darting eyes, feverish
intelligence, constantly smoking a cigarette and coughing
between words, his face pock-marked and pitted like the moon from an old acne scars, he cuts a skinny figure at the wheel of a big beige Coupe De Ville, idling the motor... with him is Waldo Rojas eating a large foot and a half banana. In contrast he's amiable, heavyset with a receding hairline, flashing a lot of gold when he smiles.
MANNY
(leaning in the window)
Hey Omar, Waldo, coma esta... my friend I told you about. Tony Montana... Omar Suarez, Waldo Rojas....
Waldo mumbles something indistinct, Omar just stares briefly as Tony hangs back, nodding arrogantly. Omar's eyes move back to Manny.
OMAR
I got something for you.
MANNY
Oh yeah! That's great... What do we gotta do?
OMAR
We gotta unload a boat -- grass, twenty-five tons -- that's what we gotta do. You get five hundred each.
MANNY
Okay!
(to Tony)
See, what'd I tell you.
TONY
You gotta be kidding! Whaddayou think we are -- baggage handlers?
Omar looks at him somewhat incredulously as Tony wipes his hands on his greasy apron as he talks.
TONY
...five hundred dollars -- shit!
What'd I do for you guys in the slammer, hunh? What was the Rebenga hit -- game of dominoes or somethin'? You're talkin' to important guys here.
MANNY
(shocked)
Hey Tony, c'mon, it's okay Omar, we...
TONY
Shaddup!
Omar sniggers, his eyes shifting to Waldo who shakes his
head and laughs.
OMAR
(to Manny only)
So what's it with this dishwasher, Chico? Don't he think we coulda gotten some other space cadet to do Rebenga -- cheaper maybe. Fifty bucks?
TONY
(shrugs)
So why didn't you? And who the fuck you calling a dishwasher, I'll wipe your monekyshit ass all up and down this Boulevard.
Steps forward. Manny grabs him.
MANNY
Hey! -- Tony, Tony....
In the car, Omar looks over at Waldo.
OMAR
Guy's a lunatic, let's go.
WALDO
What about them Indians ---
The idea crosses Omar's mind, He buys it, somewhat amused.
OMAR
Yeah...
(back to Tony)
All right, smart ass, you wanna make some big bucks? You know anything about cocaine?
TONY
You kidding.
OMAR
...There's a bunch of Columbians. Flying in Friday. New guys. They say they got two keys for us for openers. Pure coke. In a motel over in Miami Beach. I want you to go over there, and if it's what they say it is, pay 'em and bring it back. You do that, you'll make five grand.
MANNY
(to Tony)
Hey, that sounds great, Tony...
Tony says nothing.
OMAR
You know how to handle a machine gun?
MANNY
Sure, we was in the Army together.
OMAR
You're gonna need a couple other guys...
MANNY
No problem.
OMAR
Meet me at Hector's bodega Friday at noon. You get the money then. Something happens to the money, pobrecito, and my boss' gonna stick your head up your asses faster'n a rabbit gets fucked.
Throws the remains of his cigarette at their feet and pulls the Coupe De Ville out of the lot.
TONY
I'm scared.
MANNY
(relieved)
Tony you're pushin' your luck.
TONY
(walking away)
You worry too much Manny -- you' re gonna get yourself a heart attack one of these days.
MANNY
(catching up)
Yeah, so who are these Colombians?
TONY
So what does it matter?
MANNY
So whatcha have that look on for when Omar bring it up?
Tony strips off his greasy apron.
TONY
So nothin'. I just don't like fuckin' Colombians that's what.
They're animals!
COOK
(intersecting, Spanish)
Where you greasers going, hunh, I got plenty of plates here.
TONY
Wash yourself. I just retired.
Throws the Cook his apron.

What the fuck you gonna do!
TONY
Look after my investments.

31 EXT. MIAMI BEACH - DAY - MOVING SHOT
The somewhat run-down, art-deco cheaper hotels of South
Miami Beach. The porches are filled with senior citizens
playing cards, reading papers, staring, slowly walking the
street.
The ramshackle sedan, jammed with Tony and his gang,
rattles past. It's a beaten-up black and blue Monte Carlo,
jacked up on its springs with dune buggy threads and
needing paint. You'd arrest these guys on sight.
32 INT./EXT. TONY'S CADILLAC - MIAMI BEACH - DAY
seen from the inside of the sedan. Tony turns down the salsa beat on the radio, smoking a cigarette tensely. Manny is driving. In the dilapidated backseat are Angel, the baby-faced punk, and Chi-Chi, both from Freedomtown.
Manny, reflecting the tension, whistles a rapid series of notes under his breath as he waits for a light to change.
MANNY
Hey look at that chick, hunh? Lookit those tits man, she's begging for it!
At the curb, an old crone hunchbacks her way in front of the teenage chick, who is coming off the beach in a bikini, blocking her off.
CHI-CHI
(looking over)
Whatta you crazy? She's 103 years old.
MANNY
Not her stupido! Her....
Camera revealing the teenager.
TONY
(the light changing)
Drive, willya.
MANNY
(mocking)
Sure, sure. Not to worry, Tony -- You get a heart attack.
(looking in the rearview mirror)
Angel, whatcha wearing the face for?
ANGEL
(tense, making light of it)
Ah, it's okay. I just y'know forgot to make an offering. I was supposed to go by the madrina today.
MANNY
You still going to that cuncha?
ANGEL
She knows her shit. She talks to Yemaya and Chango like nobody y'ever heard.
As he talks Angel fingers a Negrita charm hanging around
his neck -- Chango, God of Fire and Thunder, his black face
tilted at a carnal angle. Sharp teeth glinting, his eyes
rolling in orgasmic imagery, his head crowned with gold.
Many of the Marielitos in the film will be wearing this,
also pendants with an eye to ward off the evil spirits, red
and white beads, red kerchiefs, black hand charms silver-
bangled bracelets, etc., all relating to their Afro-Catholic
spiritualism.
MANNY
(making fun)
Yeah, Chango looking out for us,
CHI-CHI
Angel?
ANGEL
Chango looking out for all the 'bandidos' everywhere. But you gotta pay him his dues, y'know. You gotta let him know you respect him. You don't, Chango -- he gets pissed an'...
TONY
(angry)
Hey, shaddup -- all of ya! I told you before I don't go for that mystical voodoo shit. That's for the old cunchas waving their rooster cocks in some dark alley, There's no gods, there's no Chango -- nowhere! You make your own luck. So shaddup and act like you're in the United States here.
Silence. Through the windshield, the sign of a motel -- THE SUN RAY -- is coming closer.
TONY
Okay, this is it. Pull over across the street.
The motel is coming closer in silence.
TONY
(to Manny)
Money stays in the trunk till I come out and get it. Me. Nobody else. If I'm not out in fifteen minutes, something's wrong. I'm in Room 9. You ready, Angelito?
ANGEL
Sure thing.
As Manny pulls the car up, they pull out Ingram Model-10
machine pistol with folding butt and suppressor, ten inches
of kill power capable of firing 1100 rounds a minute -- it
can be slipped into a man's purse, it's in vogue. Tony getting out, to Angel:
TONY
Let's go....
CUT TO
33 EXT. SUN-RAY MOTEL - DAY
Tony and Angel come slowly, gingerly down an exterior
corridor to a room marked ""9"". Nodding to Angel who remains in the stairwell with the Ingram machine pistol, Tony knocks.
Pause.
34 EXT. TOAD'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY
The door's opened casually by an ugly, squat five-foot-four-inch Colombian, ""The Toad"". He's in his forties, sports shirt hanging over his polyester pants, old acne scars on his face, like Omar; he's good natured, a nice guy, he smiles.
TOAD
Hey, oye amigo....
Spreading his arms in such a fashion to indicate he's clean.
35 INT. TOAD'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY
Tony, stepping into the conventionally tasteless orange and
blue motel room (with heavy blue drapes blocking the windows), spreads his hands in a similar posture indicating he too is not carrying; but this is only symbolic, it's not meant to be a body search.
TONY
(as he steps in)
How you doing amigo...?
The other person in the room is a tough-looking little dark
Colombian chick with expressionless eyes, red fingernails, and short boy-cut hair, ""The Lizard""; she's tinier than the Toad, about five-two.
The Toad looks around the corridor, eases the door closed.
TONY
(checking out the room)
Mind leaving the door open so my brothers know everything's okay... okay?
Toad shrugs and readjusts, leaving it open a few inches,
the conversation clipped and nervous throughout the scene.
TOAD
Sure, no problem... This is Marta.
TONY
Hello, Marta.
She nods woodenly, stays across the room. Behind her, the
television set is on to the Cable Newswatch. The protagonists
intermittently flick their eyes to it, soothing the tension.
TOAD
I'm Hector...
Pause.
TONY
Yeah. I'm Tony. So Omar says you're okay.
TOAD
Yeah, Omar's okay.
TONY
You know Omar.
TOAD
Omar, yeah, I talk to him on the phone.
TONY
Okay...
TOAD
Okay... so you got the money?
TONY
Yeah, you got the stuff?

Two tires fly. Two wail.
A bamboo grove, all chopped down
From it, warring songs
....IS THE BEST THAT CORPORAL BOBBY SHAFTOE CAN DO ON short notice--he's standing on the running board, gripping his Springfield with one hand and the rearview mirror with the other, so counting the syllables on his fingers is out of the question. Is ``tires'' one syllable or two? How about ``wail?'' The truck finally makes up its mind not to tip over, and thuds back onto four wheels. The wail--and the moment--are lost. Bobby can still hear the coolies singing, though, and now too there's the gunlike snicking of the truck's clutch linkage as Private Wiley downshifts. Could Wiley be losing his nerve? And, in the back, under the tarps, a ton and a half of file cabinets clanking, code books slaloming, fuel spanking the tanks of Station Alpha's electrical generator. The modern world's hell on haiku writers: ``Electrical generator'' is, what, eight syllables? You couldn't even fit that onto the second line!
""Are we allowed to run over people?'' Private Wiley inquires, and then mashes the horn button before Bobby Shaftoe can answer. A Sikh policeman hurdles a night soil cart. Shaftoe's gut reaction is: Sure, what're they going to do, declare war on us? but as the highest-ranking man on this truck he's probably supposed to be using his head or something, so he doesn't blurt it out just yet. He takes stock of the situation:
Shanghai, 1645 hours, Friday, the 28th of November 1941. Bobby Shaftoe, and the other half-dozen Marines on his truck, are staring down the length of Kiukiang Road, onto which they've just made this careening high-speed turn. Cathedral's going by to the right, so that means they are, what? two blocks away from the Bund. A Yangtze River Patrol gunboat is tied up there, waiting for the stuff they've got in the back of this truck. The only real problem is that those particular two blocks are inhabited by about five million Chinese people.
Now these Chinese are sophisticated urbanites, not suntanned yokels who've never seen cars before--they'll get out of your way if you drive fast and honk your horn. And indeed many of them flee to one side of the street or the other, producing the illusion that the truck its moving faster than the forty-three miles an hour shown on its speedometer.
But the bamboo grove in Bobby Shaftoe's haiku has not been added just to put a little Oriental flavor into the poem and wow the folks back home in Oconomowoc. There is a lot of heavy bamboo in front of this truck, dozens of makeshift turnpikes blocking their path to the river, for the officers of the U.S. Navy's Asiatic Fleet, and of the Fourth Marines, who dreamed up this little operation forgot to take the Friday Afternoon factor into account. As Bobby Shaftoe could've explained to them, if only they'd bothered to ask a poor dumb jarhead, their route took them through the heart of the banking district. Here you've got the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank of course, City Bank, Chase Manhattan, the Bank of America, and BBME and the Agricultural Bank of China and any number of crappy little provincial banks, and several of those banks have contracts with what's left of the Chinese Government to print currency. It must be a cutthroat business because they slash costs by printing it on old newspapers, and if you know how to read Chinese, you can see last year's news stories and polo scores peeking through the colored numbers and pictures that transform these pieces of paper into legal tender.
As every chicken-peddler and rickshaw operator in Shanghai knows, the money-printing contracts stipulate that all of the bills these banks print have to be backed by such-and-such an amount of silver; i.e., anyone should be able to walk into one of those banks at the end of Kiukiang Road and slap down a pile of bills and (provided that those bills were printed by that same bank) receive actual metallic silver in exchange.
Now if China weren't right in the middle of getting systematically drawn and quartered by the Empire of Nippon, it would probably send official bean counters around to keep tabs on how much silver was actually present in these banks' vaults, and it would all be quiet and orderly. But as it stands, the only thing keeping these banks honest is the other banks.
Here's how they do it: during the normal course of business, lots of paper money will pass over the counters of (say) Chase Manhattan Bank. They'll take it into a back room and sort it, throwing into money boxes (a couple of feet square and a yard deep, with ropes on the four corners) all of the bills that were printed by (say) Bank of America in one, all of the City Bank bills into another. Then, on Friday afternoon they will bring in coolies. Each coolie, or pair of coolies, will of course have his great big long bamboo pole with him--a coolie without his pole is like a China Marine without his nickel-plated bayonet--and will poke their pole through the ropes on the corners of the box. Then one coolie will get underneath each end of the pole, hoisting the box into the air. They have to move in unison or else the box begins flailing around and everything gets out of whack. So as they head towards their destination--whatever bank whose name is printed on the bills in their box--they sing to each other, and plant their feet on the pavement in time to the music. The pole's pretty long, so they are that far apart, and they have to sing loud to hear each other, and of course each pair of coolies in the street is singing their own particular song, trying to drown out all of the others so that they don't get out of step.
So ten minutes before closing time on Friday afternoon, the doors of many banks burst open and numerous pairs of coolies march in singing, like the curtain-raiser on a fucking Broadway musical, slam their huge boxes of tattered currency down, and demand silver in exchange. All of the banks do this to each other. Sometimes, they'll all do it on the same Friday, particularly at times like 28 November 1941, when even a grunt like Bobby Shaftoe can understand that it's better to be holding silver than piles of old cut-up newspaper. And that is why, once the normal pedestrians and food-cart operators and furious Sikh cops have scurried out of the way, and plastered themselves up against the clubs and shops and bordellos on Kiukiang Road, Bobby Shaftoe and the other Marines on the truck still cannot even see the gunboat that is their destination, because of this horizontal forest of mighty bamboo poles. They cannot even hear the honking of their own truck horn because of the wild throbbing pentatonic cacophony of coolies singing. This ain't just your regular Friday P.M. Shanghai bank-district money-rush. This is an ultimate settling of accounts before the whole Eastern Hemisphere catches fire. The millions of promises printed on those slips of bumwad will all be kept or broken in the next ten minutes; actual pieces of silver and gold will move, or they won't. It is some kind of fiduciary Judgment Day.
``Jesus Christ, I can't--'' Private Wiley hollers.
""The captain said don't stop for any reason whatsofuckinever,'' Shaftoe reminds him. He's not telling Wiley to run over the coolies, he's reminding Wiley that if he refrains from running over them, they will have some explaining to do--which will be complicated by the fact that the captain's right behind them in a car stuffed with Tommy Gun-toting China Marines. And from the way the captain's been acting about this Station Alpha thing, it's pretty clear that he already has a few preliminary strap marks on his ass, courtesy of some admiral in Pearl Harbor or even (drumroll) Marine Barracks, Eight and Eye Streets Southeast, Washington, D.C.
Shaftoe and the other Marines have always known Station Alpha as a mysterious claque of pencil-necked swabbies who hung out on the roof of a building in the International Settlement in a shack of knot-pocked cargo pallet planks with antennas sticking out of it every which way. If you stood there long enough you could see some of those antennas moving, zeroing in on something out to sea. Shaftoe even wrote a haiku about it:
Antenna searches
Retriever's nose in the wind
Ether's far secrets
This was only his second haiku ever--clearly not up to November 1941 standards--and he cringes to remember it.
But in no way did any of the Marines comprehend what a big deal Station Alpha was until today. Their job had turned out to involve wrapping a ton of equipment and several tons of paper in tarps and moving it out of doors. Then they spent Thursday tearing the shack apart, making it into a bonfire, and burning certain books and papers.
``Sheeeyit!'' Private Wiley hollers. Only a few of the coolies have gotten out of the way, or even seen them. But then there is this fantastic boom from the river, like the sound of a mile-thick bamboo pole being snapped over God's knee. Half a second later there're no coolies in the street anymore--just a lot of boxes with unmanned bamboo poles teeter-tottering on them, bonging into the streets like wind-chimes. Above, a furry mushroom of grey smoke rises from the gunboat. Wiley shifts up to high gear and floors it. Shaftoe cringes against the truck's door and lowers his head, hoping that his campy Great War doughboy helmet will be good for something. Then money-boxes start to rupture and explode as the truck rams through them. Shaftoe peers up through a blizzard of notes and sees giant bamboo poles soaring and bounding and windmilling toward the waterfront.
The leaves of Shanghai:
Pale doorways in a steel sky.
Winter has begun.

BARRENS
Let's set the existence-of-god issue aside for a later volume, and just stipulate that in some way, self-replicating organisms came into existence on this planet and immediately began trying to get rid of each other, either by spamming their environments with rough copies of themselves, or by more direct means which hardly need to be belabored. Most of them failed, and their genetic legacy was erased from the universe forever, but a few found some way to survive and to propagate. After about three billion years of this sometimes zany, frequently tedious fugue of carnality and carnage, Godfrey Waterhouse IV was born, in Murdo, South Dakota, to Blanche, the wife of a Congregational preacher named Bunyan Waterhouse. Like every other creature on the face of the earth, Godfrey was, by birthright, a stupendous badass, albeit in the somewhat narrow technical sense that he could trace his ancestry back up a long line of slightly less highly evolved stupendous badasses to that first self-replicating gizmo--which, given the number and variety of its descendants, might justifiably be described as the most stupendous badass of all time. Everyone and everything that wasn't a stupendous badass was dead.

As nightmarishly lethal, memetically programmed death-machines went, these were the nicest you could ever hope to meet. In the tradition of his namesake (the Puritan writer John Bunyan, who spent much of his life in jail, or trying to avoid it) the Rev. Waterhouse did not preach in any one place for long. The church moved him from one small town in the Dakotas to another every year or two. It is possible that Godfrey found the lifestyle more than a little alienating, for, sometime during the course of his studies at Fargo Congregational College, he bolted from the fold and, to the enduring agony of his parents, fell into worldy pursuits, and ended up, somehow, getting a Ph.D. in Classics from a small private university in Ohio. Academics being no less nomadic than Congregational preachers, he took work where he could find it. He became a Professor of Greek and Latin at Bolger Christian College (enrollment 322) in West Point, Virginia, where the Mattaponi and Pamunkey Rivers came together to form the estuarial James, and the loathsome fumes of the big paper mill permeated every drawer, every closet, even the interior pages of books. Godfrey's young bride, nee Alice Pritchard, who had grown up following her itinerant-preacher father across the vastnesses of eastern Montana--where air smelt of snow and sage--threw up for three months. Six months later she gave birth to Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse.

The boy had a peculiar relationship with sound. When a fire engine passed, he was not troubled by the siren's howl or the bell's clang. But when a hornet got into the house and swung across the ceiling in a broad Lissajous, droning almost inaudibly, he cried in pain at the noise. And if he saw or smelled something that scared him, he would clap his hands over his ears.

One noise that troubled him not at all was the pipe organ in the chapel at Bolger Christian College. The chapel itself was nothing worth mentioning, but the organ had been endowed by the paper mill family and would have sufficed for a church four times the size. It nicely complemented the organist, a retired high school math teacher who felt that certain attributes of the Lord (violence and capriciousness in the Old Testament, majesty and triumph in the New) could be directly conveyed into the souls of the enpewed sinners through a kind of frontal sonic impregnation. That he ran the risk of blowing out the stained-glass windows was of no consequence since no one liked them anyway, and the paper mill fumes were gnawing at the interstitial lead. But after one little old lady too many staggered down the aisle after a service, reeling from tinnitus, and made a barbed comment to the minister about the exceedingly dramatic music, the organist was replaced.
Nevertheless, he continued to give lessons on the instrument. Students were not allowed to touch the organ until they were proficient at the piano, and when this was explained to Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse, he taught himself, in three weeks, how to play a Bach fugue, and signed up for organ lessons. Since he was only five years old at the time, he was unable to reach both the manuals and the pedals, and had to play standing--or rather strolling, from pedal to pedal.
When Lawrence was twelve, the organ broke down. That paper mill family had not left any endowment for maintenance, so the math teacher decided to have a crack at it. He was in poor health and required a nimble assistant: Lawrence, who helped him open up the hood of the thing. For the first time in all those years, the boy saw what had been happening when he had been pressing those keys.
For each stop--each timbre, or type of sound, that the organ could make (viz. blockflote, trumpet, piccolo)--there was a separate row of pipes, arranged in a line from long to short. Long pipes made low notes, short high. The tops of the pipes defined a graph: not a straight line but an upward-tending curve. The organist/math teacher sat down with a few loose pipes, a pencil, and paper, and helped Lawrence figure out why. When Lawrence understood, it was as if the math teacher had suddenly played the good part of Bach's Fantasia and Fugue in G Minor on a pipe organ the size of the Spiral Nebula in Andromeda--the part where Uncle Johann dissects the architecture of the Universe in one merciless descending ever-mutating chord, as if his foot is thrusting through skidding layers of garbage until it finally strikes bedrock. In particular, the final steps of the organist's explanation were like a falcon's dive through layer after layer of pretense and illusion, thrilling or sickening or confusing depending on what you were. The heavens were riven open. Lawrence glimpsed choirs of angels ranking off into geometrical infinity.
The pipes sprouted in parallel ranks from a broad flat box of compressed air. All of the pipes for a given note--but belonging to different stops--lined up with each other along one axis. All of the pipes for a given stop--but tuned at different pitches--lined up with each other along the other, perpendicular axis. Down there in the flat box of air, then, was a mechanism that got air to the right pipes at the right times. When a key or pedal was depressed, all of the pipes capable of sounding the corresponding note would speak, as long as their stops were pulled out.
Mechanically, all of this was handled in a fashion that was perfectly clear, simple, and logical. Lawrence had supposed that the machine must be at least as complicated as the most intricate fugue that could be played on it. Now he had learned that a machine, simple in its design, could produce results of infinite complexity.
Stops were rarely used alone. They tended to be piled on top of each other in combinations that were designed to take advantage of the available harmonics (more tasty mathematics here!). Certain combinations in particular were used over and over again. Lots of blockflo[autes, in varying lengths, for the quiet Offertory, for example. The organ included an ingenious mechanism called the preset, which enabled the organist to select a particular combination of stops--stops he himself had chosen--instantly. He would punch a button and several stops would bolt out from the console, driven by pneumatic pressure, and in that instant the organ would become a different instrument with entirely new timbres.
The next summer both Lawrence and Alice, his mother, were colonized by a distant cousin--a stupendous badass of a virus. Lawrence escaped from it with an almost imperceptible tendency to drag one of his feet. Alice wound up in an iron lung. Later, unable to cough effectively, she got pneumonia and died.
Lawrence's father Godfrey freely confessed that he was not equal to the burdens now laid on his shoulders. He resigned from his position at the small college in Virginia and moved, with his son, to a small house in Moorhead, Minnesota, next door to where Bunyan and Blanche had settled. Later he got a job teaching at a nearby normal school.
At this point, all of the responsible adults in Lawrence's life seemed to arrive at a tacit agreement that the best way to raise him--certainly the easiest--was to leave him alone. On the rare occasions when Lawrence requested adult intervention in his life, he was usually asking questions that no one could answer. At the age of sixteen, having found nothing in the local school system to challenge him, Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse went off to college. He matriculated at Iowa State College, which among other things was the site of a Naval ROTC installation in which he was forcibly enrolled.
The Iowa State Naval ROTC had a band, and was delighted to hear that Lawrence had an interest in music. Since it was hard to drill on the deck of a dreadnought while playing a pipe organ, they issued him a glockenspiel and a couple of little dingers.
When not marching back and forth on the flood plain of the Skunk River making loud dinging noises, Lawrence was majoring in mechanical engineering. He ended up doing poorly in this area because he had fallen in with a Bulgarian professor named John Vincent Atanasoff and his graduate student, Clifford Berry, who were building a machine that was intended to automate the solution of some especially tedious differential equations.
The basic problem for Lawrence was that he was lazy. He had figured out that everything was much simpler if, like Superman with his X-ray vision, you just stared through the cosmetic distractions and saw the underlying mathematical skeleton. Once you found the math in a thing, you knew everything about it, and you could manipulate it to your heart's content with nothing more than a pencil and a napkin. He saw it in the curve of the silver bars on his glockenspiel, saw it in the catenary arch of a bridge and in the capacitor-studded drum of Atanasoff and Berry's computing machine. Actually pounding on the glockenspiel, riveting the bridge together, or trying to figure out why the computing machine wasn't working were not as interesting to him.
Consequently he got poor grades. From time to time, though, he would perform some stunt on the blackboard that would leave his professor weak in the knees and the other students baffled and hostile. Word got around.
At the same time, his grandmother Blanche was invoking her extensive Congregational connections, working the angles on Lawrence's behalf, totally unbeknownst to him. Her efforts culminated in triumph when Lawrence was awarded an obscure scholarship, endowed by a St. Paul oat-processing heir, whose purpose was to send Midwestern Congregationalists to the Ivy League for one year, which (evidently) was deemed a long enough period of time to raise their IQs by a few crucial points but not long enough to debauch them. So Lawrence got to be a sophomore in Princeton.
Now Princeton was an august school and going there was a great honor, but no one got around to mentioning either of these facts to Lawrence, who had no way of knowing. This had bad and good consequences. He accepted the scholarship with a faintness of gratitude that infuriated the oat lord. On the other hand, he adjusted to Princeton easily because it was just another place. It reminded him of the nicer bits of Virginia, and there were some nice pipe organs in town, though he was not all that happy with his engineering homework of bridge-designing and sprocket-cutting problems. As always, these eventually came down to math, most of which he could handle easily. From time to time he would get stuck, though, which led him to the Fine Hall: the headquarters of the Math Department.
There was a motley assortment of fellows wandering around in Fine Hall, many sporting British or European accents. Administratively speaking, many of these fellows were not members of the Math Department at all, but a separate thing called IAS, which stood for Institute for Advanced something-or-other. But they were all in the same building and they all knew a thing or two about math, so the distinction didn't exist for Lawrence.
Quite a few of these men would pretend shyness when Lawrence sought their advice, but others were at least willing to hear him out. For example: he had come up with a way to solve a difficult sprocket tooth shape problem that, as normally solved by engineers, would require any number of perfectly reasonable but aesthetically displeasing approximations. Lawrence's solution would provide exact results. The only drawback was that it would require a quintillion slide-rule operators a quintillion years to solve. Lawrence was working on a radically different approach that, if it worked, would bring those figures down to a trillion and a trillion respectively. Unfortunately, Lawrence was unable to interest anyone at Fine Hall in anything as prosaic as gears, until all of a sudden he made friends with an energetic British fellow, whose name he promptly forgot, but who had been doing a lot of literal sprocket-making himself lately. This fellow was trying to build, of all things, a mechanical calculating machine--specifically a machine to calculate certain values of the Riemann Zeta Function.

certain values of the Riemann Zeta Function.

where s is a complex number.
Lawrence found this zeta function to be no more and no less interesting than any other math problem until his new friend assured him that it was frightfully important, and that some of the best mathematicians in the world had been gnawing on it for decades. The two of them ended up staying awake until three in the morning working out the solution to Lawrence's sprocket problem. Lawrence presented the results proudly to his engineering professor, who snidely rejected it, on grounds of practicality, and gave him a poor grade for his troubles.
Lawrence finally remembered, after several more contacts, that the name of the friendly Brit was Al something-or-other. Because Al was a passionate cyclist, he and Al went on quite a few bicycle rides through the countryside of the Garden State. As they rode around New Jersey, they talked about math, and particularly about machines for taking the dull part of math off their hands.
But Al had been thinking about this subject for longer than Lawrence, and had figured out that computing machines were much more than just labor-saving devices. He'd been working on a radically different sort of computing mechanism that would work out any arithmetic problem whatsoever, as long as you knew how to write the problem down. From a pure logic standpoint, he had already figured out everything there was to know about this (as yet hypothetical) machine, though he had yet to build one. Lawrence gathered that actually building machinery was looked on as undignified at Cambridge (England, that is, where this Al character was based) or for that matter at Fine Hall. Al was thrilled to have found, in Lawrence, someone who did not share this view.
Al delicately asked him, one day, if Lawrence would terribly mind calling him by his full and proper name, which was Alan and not Al. Lawrence apologized and said he would try very hard to keep it in mind.
One day a couple of weeks later, as the two of them sat by a running stream in the woods above the Delaware Water Gap, Alan made some kind of an outlandish proposal to Lawrence involving penises. It required a great deal of methodical explanation, which Alan delivered with lots of blushing and stuttering. He was ever so polite, and several times emphasized that he was acutely aware that not everyone in the world was interested in this sort of thing.
Lawrence decided that he was probably one of those people.
Alan seemed vastly impressed that Lawrence had paused to think about it at all and apologized for putting him out. They went directly back to a discussion of computing machines, and their friendship continued unchanged. But on their next bicycle ride--an overnight camping trip to the Pine Barrens--they were joined by a new fellow, a German named Rudy von something-or-other.
Alan and Rudy's relationship seemed closer, or at least more multilayered, than Alan and Lawrence's. Lawrence concluded that Alan's penis scheme must have finally found a taker.
It got Lawrence to thinking. From an evolution standpoint, what was the point of having people around who were not inclined to have offspring? There must be some good, and fairly subtle, reason for it.
The only thing he could work out was that it was groups of people--societies--rather than individual creatures, who were now trying to out-reproduce and/or kill each other, and that, in a society, there was plenty of room for someone who didn't have kids as long as he was up to something useful.
Alan and Rudy and Lawrence rode south, anyway, looking for the Pine Barrens. After a while the towns became very far apart, and the horse farms gave way to a low stubble of feeble, spiny trees that appeared to extend all the way to Florida--blocking their view, but not the headwind. ``Where are the Pine Barrens I wonder?'' Lawrence asked a couple of times. He even stopped at a gas station to ask someone that question. His companions began to make fun of him.
``Vere are ze Pine Barrens?'' Rudy inquired, looking about quizzically.
``I should look for something rather barren-looking, with numerous pine trees,'' Alan mused.
There was no other traffic and so they had spread out across the road to pedal three abreast, with Alan in the middle.
``A forest, as Kafka would imagine it,'' Rudy muttered.
By this point Lawrence had figured out that they were, in fact, in the Pine Barrens. But he didn't know who Kafka was. ``A mathematician?'' he guessed.
``Zat is a scary sing to sink of,'' Rudy said.
``He is a writer,'' Alan said. ``Lawrence, please don't be offended that I ask you this, but: do you recognize any other people's names at all? Other than family and close friends, I mean.''
Lawrence must have looked baffled. ``I'm trying to figure out whether it all comes from in here,'' Alan said, reaching out to rap his knuckles on the side of Lawrence's head, ``or do you sometimes take in new ideas from other human beings?''

``When I was a little boy, I saw angels in a church in Virginia,'' Lawrence said, ``but I think that they came from inside my head.''
``Very well,'' Alan said.
But later Alan had another go at it. They had reached the fire lookout tower and it had been a thunderous disappointment: just an alienated staircase leading nowhere, and a small cleared area below that was glittery with shards of liquor bottles. They pitched their tent by the side of a pond that turned out to be full of rust-colored algae that stuck to the hairs on their bodies. Then there was nothing left to do but drink schnapps and talk about math.

Alan said, ``Look, it's like this: Bertrand Russell and another chap named Whitehead wrote Principia Mathematica...''

``Now I know you're pulling my leg,'' Waterhouse said. ``Even I know that Sir Isaac Newton wrote that.''

``Newton wrote a different book, also called Principia Mathematica, which isn't really about mathematics at all; it's about what we would today call physics.''

``Then why did he call it Principia Mathematica?''

``Because the distinction between mathematics and physics wasn't especially clear in Newton's day--''

``Or maybe even in zis day,'' Rudy said.

``--which is directly relevant to what I'm talking about,'' Alan continued. ``I am talking about Russell's P.M., in which he and Whitehead started absolutely from scratch, I mean from nothing, and built it all up--all mathematics--from a small number of first principles. And why I am telling you this, Lawrence, is that--Lawrence! Pay attention!''

``Hmmm?''

``Rudy--take this stick, here--that's right--and keep a close eye on Lawrence, and when he gets that foggy look on his face, poke him with it!''

``Zis is not an English school, you can't do zese kind of sing.''

``I'm listening,'' Lawrence said.

``What came out of P.M., which was terrifically radical, was the ability to say that all of math, really, can be expressed as a certain ordering of symbols.''
``Leibniz said it a long time before zen!'' protested Rudy.
``Er, Leibniz invented the notation we use for calculus, but--''
``I'm not talking about zat!''
``And he invented matrices, but--''
``I'm not talking about zat eezer!''
``And he did some work with binary arithmetic, but--''
``Zat is completely different!''
``Well, what the hell are you talking about, then, Rudy?''
``Leibniz invented ze basic alphabet--wrote down a set of symbols, for expressing statements about logic.''
``Well, I wasn't aware that Herr Leibniz counted formal logic among his interests, but--''
``Of course! He wanted to do what Russell and Whitehead did, except not just with mathematics, but with everything in ze whole world!''
``Well from the fact that you are the only man on the planet, Rudy, who seems to know about this undertaking of Leibniz's, can we assume that he failed?''
``You can assume anything that pleases your fancy, Alan,'' Rudy responded, ``but I am a mathematician and I do not assume anything.''
Alan sighed woundedly, and gave Rudy a Significant Look which Waterhouse assumed meant that there would be trouble later. ``If I may just make some headway, here,'' he said, ``all I'm really trying to get you to agree on, is that mathematics can be expressed as a series of symbols,'' (he snatched the Lawrence-poking stick and began drawing things like  the dirt) ``and frankly I could not care less whether they happen to be Leibniz's symbols, or Russell's, or the hexagrams of the I Ching....''
``Leibniz was fascinated by the I Ching!'' Rudy began.
``Shut up about Leibniz for a moment, Rudy, because look here: You--Rudy--and I are on a train, as it were, sitting in the dining car, having a nice conversation, and that train is being pulled along at a terrific clip by certain locomotives named The Bertrand Russell and Riemann and Euler and others. And our friend Lawrence is running alongside the train, trying to keep up with us--it's not that we're smarter than he is, necessarily, but that he's a farmer who didn't get a ticket. And I, Rudy, am simply reaching out through the open window here, trying to pull him onto the fucking train with us so that the three of us can have a nice little chat about mathematics without having to listen to him panting and gasping for breath the whole way.''
``All right, Alan.''
``Won't take a minute if you will just stop interrupting.''
``But there is a locomotive too named Leibniz.''
``Is it that you don't think I give enough credit to Germans? Because I am about to mention a fellow with an umlaut.''
``Oh, would it be Herr Turing?'' Rudy said slyly.
``Herr Turing comes later. I was actually thinking of Godel.''
``But he's not German! He's Austrian!''
``I'm afraid that it's all the same now, isn't it?''

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†ARTHUR MOREL was growing up. He was a quick, careless, impulsive boy, a good deal like his father. He hated study, made a great moan if he had to work, and escaped as soon as possible to his sport again.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†In appearance he remained the flower of the family, being well made, graceful, and full of life. His dark brown hair and fresh colouring, and his exquisite dark blue eyes shaded with long lashes, together with his generous manner and fiery temper, made him a favourite. But as he grew older his temper became uncertain. He flew into rages over nothing, seemed unbearably raw and irritable.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†His mother, whom he loved, wearied of him sometimes. He thought only of himself. When he wanted amusement, all that stood in his way he hated, even if it were she. When he was in trouble he moaned to her ceaselessly.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""Goodness, boy!"" she said, when he groaned about a master who, he said, hated him, ""if you don't like it, alter it, and if you can't alter it, put up with it.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†And his father, whom he had loved and who had worshipped him, he came to detest. As he grew older Morel fell into a slow ruin. His body, which had been beautiful in movement and in being, shrank, did not seem to ripen with the years, but to get mean and rather despicable. There came over him a look of meanness and of paltriness. And when the mean-looking elderly man bullied or ordered the boy about, Arthur was furious. Moreover, Morel's manners got worse and worse, his habits somewhat disgusting. When the children were growing up and in the crucial stage of adolescence, the father was like some ugly irritant to their souls. His manners in the house were the same as he used among the colliers down pit.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""Dirty nuisance!"" Arthur would cry, jumping up and going straight out of the house when his father disgusted him. And Morel persisted the more because his children hated it. He seemed to take a kind of satisfaction in disgusting them, and driving them nearly mad, while they were so irritably sensitive at the age of fourteen or fifteen. So that Arthur, who was growing up when his father was degenerate and elderly, hated him worst of all.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Then, sometimes, the father would seem to feel the contemptuous hatred of his children.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""There's not a man tries harder for his family!"" he would shout. ""He does his best for them, and then gets treated like a dog. But I'm not going to stand it, I tell you!""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†But for the threat and the fact that he did not try so hard as he imagined, they would have felt sorry. As it was, the battle now went on nearly all between father and children, he persisting in his dirty and disgusting ways, just to assert his independence. They loathed him.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Arthur was so inflamed and irritable at last, that when he won a scholarship for the Grammar School in Nottingham, his mother decided to let him live in town, with one of her sisters, and only come home at week-ends.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Annie was still a junior teacher in the Board-school, earning about four shillings a week. But soon she would have fifteen shillings, since she had passed her examination, and there would be financial peace in the house.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Mrs. Morel clung now to Paul. He was quiet and not brilliant. But still he stuck to his painting, and still he stuck to his mother. Everything he did was for her. She waited for his coming home in the evening, and then she unburdened herself of all she had pondered, or of all that had occurred to her during the day. He sat and listened with his earnestness. The two shared lives.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†William was engaged now to his brunette, and had bought her an engagement ring that cost eight guineas. The children gasped at such a fabulous price.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""Eight guineas!"" said Morel. ""More fool him! If he'd gen me some on't, it 'ud ha' looked better on 'im.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""Given YOU some of it!"" cried Mrs. Morel. ""Why give YOU some of it!""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†She remembered HE had bought no engagement ring at all, and she preferred William, who was not mean, if he were foolish. But now the young man talked only of the dances to which he went with his betrothed, and the different resplendent clothes she wore; or he told his mother with glee how they went to the theatre like great swells.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†He wanted to bring the girl home. Mrs. Morel said she should come at the Christmas. This time William arrived with a lady, but with no presents. Mrs. Morel had prepared supper. Hearing footsteps, she rose and went to the door. William entered.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""Hello, mother!"" He kissed her hastily, then stood aside to present a tall, handsome girl, who was wearing a costume of fine black-and-white check, and furs.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""Here's Gyp!""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Miss Western held out her hand and showed her teeth in a small smile.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""Oh, how do you do, Mrs. Morel!"" she exclaimed.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""I am afraid you will be hungry,"" said Mrs. Morel.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""Oh no, we had dinner in the train. Have you got my gloves, Chubby?""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†William Morel, big and raw-boned, looked at her quickly.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""How should I?"" he said.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""Then I've lost them. Don't be cross with me.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†A frown went over his face, but he said nothing. She glanced round the kitchen. It was small and curious to her, with its glittering kissing-bunch, its evergreens behind the pictures, its wooden chairs and little deal table. At that moment Morel came in.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""Hello, dad!""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""Hello, my son! Tha's let on me!""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†The two shook hands, and William presented the lady. She gave the same smile that showed her teeth.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""How do you do, Mr. Morel?""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Morel bowed obsequiously.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""I'm very well, and I hope so are you. You must make yourself very welcome.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""Oh, thank you,"" she replied, rather amused.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""You will like to go upstairs,"" said Mrs. Morel.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""If you don't mind; but not if it is any trouble to you.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""It is no trouble. Annie will take you. Walter, carry up this box.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""And don't be an hour dressing yourself up,"" said William to his betrothed.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Annie took a brass candlestick, and, too shy almost to speak, preceded the young lady to the front bedroom, which Mr. and Mrs. Morel had vacated for her. It, too, was small and cold by candlelight. The colliers' wives only lit fires in bedrooms in case of extreme illness.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""Shall I unstrap the box?"" asked Annie.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""Oh, thank you very much!""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Annie played the part of maid, then went downstairs for hot water.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""I think she's rather tired, mother,"" said William. ""It's a beastly journey, and we had such a rush.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""Is there anything I can give her?"" asked Mrs. Morel.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""Oh no, she'll be all right.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†But there was a chill in the atmosphere. After half an hour Miss Western came down, having put on a purplish-coloured dress, very fine for the collier's kitchen.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""I told you you'd no need to change,"" said William to her.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""Oh, Chubby!"" Then she turned with that sweetish smile to Mrs. Morel. ""Don't you think he's always grumbling, Mrs. Morel?""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""Is he?"" said Mrs. Morel. ""That's not very nice of him.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""It isn't, really!""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""You are cold,"" said the mother. ""Won't you come near the fire?""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Morel jumped out of his armchair.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""Come and sit you here!"" he cried. ""Come and sit you here!""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""No, dad, keep your own chair. Sit on the sofa, Gyp,"" said William.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""No, no!"" cried Morel. ""This cheer's warmest. Come and sit here, Miss Wesson.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""Thank you so much,"" said the girl, seating herself in the collier's armchair, the place of honour. She shivered, feeling the warmth of the kitchen penetrate her.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""Fetch me a hanky, Chubby dear!"" she said, putting up her mouth to him, and using the same intimate tone as if they were alone; which made the rest of the family feel as if they ought not to be present. The young lady evidently did not realise them as people: they were creatures to her for the present. William winced.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†In such a household, in Streatham, Miss Western would have been a lady condescending to her inferiors. These people were to her, certainly clownish‚Äîin short, the working classes. How was she to adjust herself?
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""I'll go,"" said Annie.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Miss Western took no notice, as if a servant had spoken. But when the girl came downstairs again with the handkerchief, she said: ""Oh, thank you!"" in a gracious way.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†She sat and talked about the dinner on the train, which had been so poor; about London, about dances. She was really very nervous, and chattered from fear. Morel sat all the time smoking his thick twist tobacco, watching her, and listening to her glib London speech, as he puffed. Mrs. Morel, dressed up in her best black silk blouse, answered quietly and rather briefly. The three children sat round in silence and admiration. Miss Western was the princess. Everything of the best was got out for her: the best cups, the best spoons, the best table cloth, the best coffee-jug. The children thought she must find it quite grand. She felt strange, not able to realise the people, not knowing how to treat them. William joked, and was slightly uncomfortable.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†At about ten o'clock he said to her:
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""Aren't you tired, Gyp?""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""Rather, Chubby,"" she answered, at once in the intimate tones and putting her head slightly on one side.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""I'll light her the candle, mother,"" he said.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""Very well,"" replied the mother.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Miss Western stood up, held out her hand to Mrs. Morel.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""Good-night, Mrs. Morel,"" she said.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Paul sat at the boiler, letting the water run from the tap into a stone beer-bottle. Annie swathed the bottle in an old flannel pit-singlet, and kissed her mother good-night. She was to share the room with the lady, because the house was full.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""You wait a minute,"" said Mrs. Morel to Annie. And Annie sat nursing the hot-water bottle. Miss Western shook hands all round, to everybody's discomfort, and took her departure, preceded by William. In five minutes he was downstairs again. His heart was rather sore; he did not know why. He talked very little till everybody had gone to bed, but himself and his mother. Then he stood with his legs apart, in his old attitude on the hearthrug, and said hesitatingly:
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""Well, mother?""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""Well, my son?""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†She sat in the rocking-chair, feeling somehow hurt and humiliated, for his sake.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""Do you like her?""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""Yes,"" came the slow answer.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""She's shy yet, mother. She's not used to it. It's different from her aunt's house, you know.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""Of course it is, my boy; and she must find it difficult.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""She does."" Then he frowned swiftly. ""If only she wouldn't put on her BLESSED airs!""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""It's only her first awkwardness, my boy. She'll be all right.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""That's it, mother,"" he replied gratefully. But his brow was gloomy. ""You know, she's not like you, mother. She's not serious, and she can't think.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""She's young, my boy.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""Yes; and she's had no sort of show. Her mother died when she was a child. Since then she's lived with her aunt, whom she can't bear. And her father was a rake. She's had no love.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""No! Well, you must make up to her.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""And so‚Äîyou have to forgive her a lot of things.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""WHAT do you have to forgive her, my boy?""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""I dunno. When she seems shallow, you have to remember she's never had anybody to bring her deeper side out. And she's FEARFULLY fond of me.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""Anybody can see that.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""But you know, mother‚Äîshe's‚Äîshe's different from us. Those sort of people, like those she lives amongst, they don't seem to have the same principles.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""You mustn't judge too hastily,"" said Mrs. Morel.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†But he seemed uneasy within himself.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†In the morning, however, he was up singing and larking round the house.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""Hello!"" he called, sitting on the stairs. ""Are you getting up?""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""Yes,"" her voice called faintly.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""Merry Christmas!"" he shouted to her.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Her laugh, pretty and tinkling, was heard in the bedroom. She did not come down in half an hour.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""Was she REALLY getting up when she said she was?"" he asked of Annie.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""Yes, she was,"" replied Annie.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†He waited a while, then went to the stairs again.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""Happy New Year,"" he called.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""Thank you, Chubby dear!"" came the laughing voice, far away.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""Buck up!"" he implored.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†It was nearly an hour, and still he was waiting for her. Morel, who always rose before six, looked at the clock.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""Well, it's a winder!"" he exclaimed.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†The family had breakfasted, all but William. He went to the foot of the stairs.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""Shall I have to send you an Easter egg up there?"" he called, rather crossly. She only laughed. The family expected, after that time of preparation, something like magic. At last she came, looking very nice in a blouse and skirt.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""Have you REALLY been all this time getting ready?"" he asked.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""Chubby dear! That question is not permitted, is it, Mrs. Morel?""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†She played the grand lady at first. When she went with William to chapel, he in his frock-coat and silk hat, she in her furs and London-made costume, Paul and Arthur and Annie expected everybody to bow to the ground in admiration. And Morel, standing in his Sunday suit at the end of the road, watching the gallant pair go, felt he was the father of princes and princesses.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†And yet she was not so grand. For a year now she had been a sort of secretary or clerk in a London office. But while she was with the Morels she queened it. She sat and let Annie or Paul wait on her as if they were her servants. She treated Mrs. Morel with a certain glibness and Morel with patronage. But after a day or so she began to change her tune.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†William always wanted Paul or Annie to go along with them on their walks. It was so much more interesting. And Paul really DID admire ""Gipsy"" wholeheartedly; in fact, his mother scarcely forgave the boy for the adulation with which he treated the girl.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†On the second day, when Lily said: ""Oh, Annie, do you know where I left my muff?"" William replied:
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""You know it is in your bedroom. Why do you ask Annie?""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†And Lily went upstairs with a cross, shut mouth. But it angered the young man that she made a servant of his sister.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†On the third evening William and Lily were sitting together in the parlour by the fire in the dark. At a quarter to eleven Mrs. Morel was heard raking the fire. William came out to the kitchen, followed by his beloved.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""Is it as late as that, mother?"" he said. She had been sitting alone.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""It is not LATE, my boy, but it is as late as I usually sit up.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""Won't you go to bed, then?"" he asked.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""And leave you two? No, my boy, I don't believe in it.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""Can't you trust us, mother?""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""Whether I can or not, I won't do it. You can stay till eleven if you like, and I can read.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""Go to bed, Gyp,"" he said to his girl. ""We won't keep mater waiting.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""Annie has left the candle burning, Lily,"" said Mrs. Morel; ""I think you will see.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""Yes, thank you. Good-night, Mrs. Morel.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†William kissed his sweetheart at the foot of the stairs, and she went. He returned to the kitchen.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""Can't you trust us, mother?"" he repeated, rather offended.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""My boy, I tell you I don't BELIEVE in leaving two young things like you alone downstairs when everyone else is in bed.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†And he was forced to take this answer. He kissed his mother good-night.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†At Easter he came over alone. And then he discussed his sweetheart endlessly with his mother.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""You know, mother, when I'm away from her I don't care for her a bit. I shouldn't care if I never saw her again. But, then, when I'm with her in the evenings I am awfully fond of her.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""It's a queer sort of love to marry on,"" said Mrs. Morel, ""if she holds you no more than that!""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""It IS funny!"" he exclaimed. It worried and perplexed him. ""But yet‚Äîthere's so much between us now I couldn't give her up.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""You know best,"" said Mrs. Morel. ""But if it is as you say, I wouldn't call it LOVE‚Äîat any rate, it doesn't look much like it.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""Oh, I don't know, mother. She's an orphan, and‚Äî""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†They never came to any sort of conclusion. He seemed puzzled and rather fretted. She was rather reserved. All his strength and money went in keeping this girl. He could scarcely afford to take his mother to Nottingham when he came over.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Paul's wages had been raised at Christmas to ten shillings, to his great joy. He was quite happy at Jordan's, but his health suffered from the long hours and the confinement. His mother, to whom he became more and more significant, thought how to help.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†His half-day holiday was on Monday afternoon. On a Monday morning in May, as the two sat alone at breakfast, she said:
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""I think it will be a fine day.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†He looked up in surprise. This meant something.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""You know Mr. Leivers has gone to live on a new farm. Well, he asked me last week if I wouldn't go and see Mrs. Leivers, and I promised to bring you on Monday if it's fine. Shall we go?""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""I say, little woman, how lovely!"" he cried. ""And we'll go this afternoon?""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Paul hurried off to the station jubilant. Down Derby Road was a cherry-tree that glistened. The old brick wall by the Statutes ground burned scarlet, spring was a very flame of green. And the steep swoop of highroad lay, in its cool morning dust, splendid with patterns of sunshine and shadow, perfectly still. The trees sloped their great green shoulders proudly; and inside the warehouse all the morning, the boy had a vision of spring outside.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†When he came home at dinner-time his mother was rather excited.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""Are we going?"" he asked.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""When I'm ready,"" she replied.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Presently he got up.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""Go and get dressed while I wash up,"" he said.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†She did so. He washed the pots, straightened, and then took her boots. They were quite clean. Mrs. Morel was one of those naturally exquisite people who can walk in mud without dirtying their shoes. But Paul had to clean them for her. They were kid boots at eight shillings a pair. He, however, thought them the most dainty boots in the world, and he cleaned them with as much reverence as if they had been flowers.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Suddenly she appeared in the inner doorway rather shyly. She had got a new cotton blouse on. Paul jumped up and went forward.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""Oh, my stars!"" he exclaimed. ""What a bobby-dazzler!""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†She sniffed in a little haughty way, and put her head up.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""It's not a bobby-dazzler at all!"" she replied. ""It's very quiet.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†She walked forward, whilst he hovered round her.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""Well,"" she asked, quite shy, but pretending to be high and mighty, ""do you like it?""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""Awfully! You ARE a fine little woman to go jaunting out with!""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†He went and surveyed her from the back.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""Well,"" he said, ""if I was walking down the street behind you, I should say: 'Doesn't THAT little person fancy herself!""'
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""Well, she doesn't,"" replied Mrs. Morel. ""She's not sure it suits her.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""Oh no! she wants to be in dirty black, looking as if she was wrapped in burnt paper. It DOES suit you, and I say you look nice.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†She sniffed in her little way, pleased, but pretending to know better.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""Well,"" she said, ""it's cost me just three shillings. You couldn't have got it ready-made for that price, could you?""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""I should think you couldn't,"" he replied.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""And, you know, it's good stuff.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""Awfully pretty,"" he said.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†The blouse was white, with a little sprig of heliotrope and black.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""Too young for me, though, I'm afraid,"" she said.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""Too young for you!"" he exclaimed in disgust. ""Why don't you buy some false white hair and stick it on your head.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""I s'll soon have no need,"" she replied. ""I'm going white fast enough.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""Well, you've no business to,"" he said. ""What do I want with a white-haired mother?""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""I'm afraid you'll have to put up with one, my lad,"" she said rather strangely.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†They set off in great style, she carrying the umbrella William had given her, because of the sun. Paul was considerably taller than she, though he was not big. He fancied himself.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†On the fallow land the young wheat shone silkily. Minton pit waved its plumes of white steam, coughed, and rattled hoarsely.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""Now look at that!"" said Mrs. Morel. Mother and son stood on the road to watch. Along the ridge of the great pit-hill crawled a little group in silhouette against the sky, a horse, a small truck, and a man. They climbed the incline against the heavens. At the end the man tipped the wagon. There was an undue rattle as the waste fell down the sheer slope of the enormous bank.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""You sit a minute, mother,"" he said, and she took a seat on a bank, whilst he sketched rapidly. She was silent whilst he worked, looking round at the afternoon, the red cottages shining among their greenness.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""The world is a wonderful place,"" she said, ""and wonderfully beautiful.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""And so's the pit,"" he said. ""Look how it heaps together, like something alive almost‚Äîa big creature that you don't know.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""Yes,"" she said. ""Perhaps!""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""And all the trucks standing waiting, like a string of beasts to be fed,"" he said.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""And very thankful I am they ARE standing,"" she said, ""for that means they'll turn middling time this week.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""But I like the feel of MEN on things, while they're alive. There's a feel of men about trucks, because they've been handled with men's hands, all of them.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""Yes,"" said Mrs. Morel.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†They went along under the trees of the highroad. He was constantly informing her, but she was interested. They passed the end of Nethermere, that was tossing its sunshine like petals lightly in its lap. Then they turned on a private road, and in some trepidation approached a big farm. A dog barked furiously. A woman came out to see.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""Is this the way to Willey Farm?"" Mrs. Morel asked.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Paul hung behind in terror of being sent back. But the woman was amiable, and directed them. The mother and son went through the wheat and oats, over a little bridge into a wild meadow. Peewits, with their white breasts glistening, wheeled and screamed about them. The lake was still and blue. High overhead a heron floated. Opposite, the wood heaped on the hill, green and still.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""It's a wild road, mother,"" said Paul. ""Just like Canada.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""Isn't it beautiful!"" said Mrs. Morel, looking round.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""See that heron‚Äîsee‚Äîsee her legs?""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†He directed his mother, what she must see and what not. And she was quite content.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""But now,"" she said, ""which way? He told me through the wood.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†The wood, fenced and dark, lay on their left.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""I can feel a bit of a path this road,"" said Paul. ""You've got town feet, somehow or other, you have.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†They found a little gate, and soon were in a broad green alley of the wood, with a new thicket of fir and pine on one hand, an old oak glade dipping down on the other. And among the oaks the bluebells stood in pools of azure, under the new green hazels, upon a pale fawn floor of oak-leaves. He found flowers for her.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""Here's a bit of new-mown hay,"" he said; then, again, he brought her forget-me-nots. And, again, his heart hurt with love, seeing her hand, used with work, holding the little bunch of flowers he gave her. She was perfectly happy.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†But at the end of the riding was a fence to climb. Paul was over in a second.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""Come,"" he said, ""let me help you.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""No, go away. I will do it in my own way.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†He stood below with his hands up ready to help her. She climbed cautiously.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""What a way to climb!"" he exclaimed scornfully, when she was safely to earth again.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""Hateful stiles!"" she cried.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""Duffer of a little woman,"" he replied, ""who can't get over 'em.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†In front, along the edge of the wood, was a cluster of low red farm buildings. The two hastened forward. Flush with the wood was the apple orchard, where blossom was falling on the grindstone. The pond was deep under a hedge and overhanging oak trees. Some cows stood in the shade. The farm and buildings, three sides of a quadrangle, embraced the sunshine towards the wood. It was very still.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Mother and son went into the small railed garden, where was a scent of red gillivers. By the open door were some floury loaves, put out to cool. A hen was just coming to peck them. Then, in the doorway suddenly appeared a girl in a dirty apron. She was about fourteen years old, had a rosy dark face, a bunch of short black curls, very fine and free, and dark eyes; shy, questioning, a little resentful of the strangers, she disappeared. In a minute another figure appeared, a small, frail woman, rosy, with great dark brown eyes.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""Oh!"" she exclaimed, smiling with a little glow, ""you've come, then. I AM glad to see you."" Her voice was intimate and rather sad.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†The two women shook hands.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""Now are you sure we're not a bother to you?"" said Mrs. Morel. ""I know what a farming life is.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""Oh no! We're only too thankful to see a new face, it's so lost up here.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""I suppose so,"" said Mrs. Morel.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†They were taken through into the parlour‚Äîa long, low room, with a great bunch of guelder-roses in the fireplace. There the women talked, whilst Paul went out to survey the land. He was in the garden smelling the gillivers and looking at the plants, when the girl came out quickly to the heap of coal which stood by the fence.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""I suppose these are cabbage-roses?"" he said to her, pointing to the bushes along the fence.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†She looked at him with startled, big brown eyes.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""I suppose they are cabbage-roses when they come out?"" he said.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""I don't know,"" she faltered. ""They're white with pink middles.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""Then they're maiden-blush.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Miriam flushed. She had a beautiful warm colouring.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""I don't know,"" she said.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""You don't have MUCH in your garden,"" he said.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""This is our first year here,"" she answered, in a distant, rather superior way, drawing back and going indoors. He did not notice, but went his round of exploration. Presently his mother came out, and they went through the buildings. Paul was hugely delighted.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""And I suppose you have the fowls and calves and pigs to look after?"" said Mrs. Morel to Mrs. Leivers.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""No,"" replied the little woman. ""I can't find time to look after cattle, and I'm not used to it. It's as much as I can do to keep going in the house.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""Well, I suppose it is,"" said Mrs. Morel.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Presently the girl came out.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""Tea is ready, mother,"" she said in a musical, quiet voice.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""Oh, thank you, Miriam, then we'll come,"" replied her mother, almost ingratiatingly. ""Would you CARE to have tea now, Mrs. Morel?""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""Of course,"" said Mrs. Morel. ""Whenever it's ready.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Paul and his mother and Mrs. Leivers had tea together. Then they went out into the wood that was flooded with bluebells, while fumy forget-me-nots were in the paths. The mother and son were in ecstasy together.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†When they got back to the house, Mr. Leivers and Edgar, the eldest son, were in the kitchen. Edgar was about eighteen. Then Geoffrey and Maurice, big lads of twelve and thirteen, were in from school. Mr. Leivers was a good-looking man in the prime of life, with a golden-brown moustache, and blue eyes screwed up against the weather.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†The boys were condescending, but Paul scarcely observed it. They went round for eggs, scrambling into all sorts of places. As they were feeding the fowls Miriam came out. The boys took no notice of her. One hen, with her yellow chickens, was in a coop. Maurice took his hand full of corn and let the hen peck from it.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""Durst you do it?"" he asked of Paul.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""Let's see,"" said Paul.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†He had a small hand, warm, and rather capable-looking. Miriam watched. He held the corn to the hen. The bird eyed it with her hard, bright eye, and suddenly made a peck into his hand. He started, and laughed. ""Rap, rap, rap!"" went the bird's beak in his palm. He laughed again, and the other boys joined.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""She knocks you, and nips you, but she never hurts,"" said Paul, when the last corn had gone. ""Now, Miriam,"" said Maurice, ""you come an 'ave a go.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""No,"" she cried, shrinking back.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""Ha! baby. The mardy-kid!"" said her brothers.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""It doesn't hurt a bit,"" said Paul. ""It only just nips rather nicely.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""No,"" she still cried, shaking her black curls and shrinking.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""She dursn't,"" said Geoffrey. ""She niver durst do anything except recite poitry.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""Dursn't jump off a gate, dursn't tweedle, dursn't go on a slide, dursn't stop a girl hittin' her. She can do nowt but go about thinkin' herself somebody. 'The Lady of the Lake.' Yah!"" cried Maurice.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Miriam was crimson with shame and misery.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""I dare do more than you,"" she cried. ""You're never anything but cowards and bullies.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""Oh, cowards and bullies!"" they repeated mincingly, mocking her speech.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""Not such a clown shall anger me,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†A boor is answered silently,""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†he quoted against her, shouting with laughter.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†She went indoors. Paul went with the boys into the orchard, where they had rigged up a parallel bar. They did feats of strength. He was more agile than strong, but it served. He fingered a piece of apple-blossom that hung low on a swinging bough.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""I wouldn't get the apple-blossom,"" said Edgar, the eldest brother. ""There'll be no apples next year.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""I wasn't going to get it,"" replied Paul, going away.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†The boys felt hostile to him; they were more interested in their own pursuits. He wandered back to the house to look for his mother. As he went round the back, he saw Miriam kneeling in front of the hen-coop, some maize in her hand, biting her lip, and crouching in an intense attitude. The hen was eyeing her wickedly. Very gingerly she put forward her hand. The hen bobbed for her. She drew back quickly with a cry, half of fear, half of chagrin.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""It won't hurt you,"" said Paul.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†She flushed crimson and started up.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""I only wanted to try,"" she said in a low voice.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""See, it doesn't hurt,"" he said, and, putting only two corns in his palm, he let the hen peck, peck, peck at his bare hand. ""It only makes you laugh,"" he said.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†She put her hand forward and dragged it away, tried again, and started back with a cry. He frowned.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""Why, I'd let her take corn from my face,"" said Paul, ""only she bumps a bit. She's ever so neat. If she wasn't, look how much ground she'd peck up every day.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†He waited grimly, and watched. At last Miriam let the bird peck from her hand. She gave a little cry‚Äîfear, and pain because of fear‚Äîrather pathetic. But she had done it, and she did it again.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""There, you see,"" said the boy. ""It doesn't hurt, does it?""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†She looked at him with dilated dark eyes.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""No,"" she laughed, trembling.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Then she rose and went indoors. She seemed to be in some way resentful of the boy.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""He thinks I'm only a common girl,"" she thought, and she wanted to prove she was a grand person like the ""Lady of the Lake"".
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Paul found his mother ready to go home. She smiled on her son. He took the great bunch of flowers. Mr. and Mrs. Leivers walked down the fields with them. The hills were golden with evening; deep in the woods showed the darkening purple of bluebells. It was everywhere perfectly stiff, save for the rustling of leaves and birds.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""But it is a beautiful place,"" said Mrs. Morel.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""Yes,"" answered Mr. Leivers; ""it's a nice little place, if only it weren't for the rabbits. The pasture's bitten down to nothing. I dunno if ever I s'll get the rent off it.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†He clapped his hands, and the field broke into motion near the woods, brown rabbits hopping everywhere.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""Would you believe it!"" exclaimed Mrs. Morel.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†She and Paul went on alone together.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†""Wasn't it lovely, mother?"" he said quietly.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†A thin moon was coming out. His heart was full of happiness till it hurt. His mother had to chatter, because she, too, wanted to cry with happiness.

His (Stephen's) mind was not exactly what you would call wandering but a bit unsteady and on his expressed desire for some beverage to drink Mr Bloom, in view of the hour it was and there being no pumps of Vartry water available for their ablutions, let alone drinking purposes, hit upon an expedient by suggesting, off the reel, the propriety of the cabman's shelter, as it was called, hardly a stonesthrow away near Butt Bridge, where they might hit upon some drinkables in the shape of a milk and soda or a mineral. But how to get there was the rub. For the nonce he was rather nonplussed but inasmuch as the duty plainly devolved upon him to take some measures on the subject he pondered suitable ways and means during which Stephen repeatedly yawned. So far as he could see he was rather pale in the face so that it occurred to him as highly advisable to get a conveyance of some description which would answer in their then condition, both of them being e. d. ed, particularly Stephen, always assuming that there was such a thing to be found. Accordingly, after a few such preliminaries, as, in spite of his having forgotten to take up his rather soapsuddy handkerchief after it had done yeoman service in the shaving line, brushing, they both walked together along Beaver street, or, more properly, lane, as far as the farrier's and the distinctly fetid atmosphere of the livery stables at the corner of Montgomery street where they made tracks to the left from thence debouching into Amiens Street round by the corner of Dan Bergin's. But, as he confidently anticipated, there was not a sign of a Jehu plying for hire anywhere to be seen except a fourwheeler, probably engaged by some fellows inside on the spree, outside the North Star Hotel and there was no symptom of its budging a quarter of an inch when Mr Bloom, who was anything but a professional whistler, endeavoured to hail it by emitting a kind of a whistle, holding his arms arched over his head, twice.
This was a quandary but, bringing commonsense to bear on it, evidently there was nothing for it but put a good face on the matter and foot it which they accordingly did. So, bevelling around by Mullet's and the Signal House, which they shortly reached, they proceeded perforce in the direction of Amiens street railway terminus, Mr Bloom being handicapped by the circumstance that one of the back buttons of his trousers had, to vary the timehonoured adage, gone the way of all buttons, though, entering thoroughly into the spirit of the thing, he heroically made light of the mischance. So, as neither of them were particularly pressed for time, as it happened, and the temperature refreshing since it cleared up after the recent visitation of Jupiter Pluvius, they dandered along past by where the empty vehicle was waiting without a fare or a jarvey. As it so happened a Dublin United Tramways Company's sandstrewer happening to be returning the elder man recounted to his companion √† propos of the incident his own truly miraculous escape of some little while back. They passed the main entrance of the Great Northern railway station, the starting point for Belfast, where of course all traffic was suspended at that late hour, and, passing the back door of the morgue (a not very enticing locality, not to say gruesome to a degree, more especially at night), ultimately gained the Dock Tavern and in due course turned into Store street, famous for its C division police station. Between this point and the high, at present unlit, warehouses of Beresford Place Stephen thought to think of Ibsen, associated with Baird's, the stonecutter's, in his mind somehow in Talbot Place, first turning on the right, while the other, who was acting as his fidus Achates, inhaled with internal satisfaction the smell of James Rourke's city bakery, situated quite close to where they were, the very palatable odour indeed of our daily bread, of all commodities of the public the primary and most indispensable. Bread, the staff of life, earn your bread, O tell me where is fancy bread? At Rourke's the baker's, it is said.
En route, to his taciturn, and, not to put too fine a point on it, not yet perfectly sober companion, Mr Bloom, who at all events, was in complete possession of his faculties, never more so, in fact disgustingly sober, spoke a word of caution re the dangers of nighttown, women of ill fame and swell mobsmen, which, barely permissible once in a while, though not as a habitual practice, was of the nature of a regular deathtrap for young fellows of his age particularly if they had acquired drinking habits under the influence of liquor unless you knew a little juijitsu for every contingency as even a fellow on the broad of his back could administer a nasty kick if you didn't look out. Highly providential was the appearance on the scene of Corny Kelleher when Stephen was blissfully unconscious that, but for that man in the gap turning up at the eleventh hour, the finis might have been that he might have been a candidate for the accident ward, or, failing that, the Bridewell and an appearance in the court next day before Mr Tobias, or, he being the solicitor, rather old Wall, he meant to say, or Malony which simply spelt ruin for a chap when it got bruited about. The reason he mentioned the fact was that a lot of those policemen, whom he cordially disliked, were admittedly unscrupulous in the service of the Crown and, as Mr Bloom put it, recalling a case or two in the A Division in Clanbrassil street, prepared to swear a hole through a ten gallon pot. Never on the spot when wanted but in quiet parts of the City, Pembroke Road, for example, the guardians of the law were well in evidence, the obvious reason being they were paid to protect the upper classes. Another thing he commented on was equipping soldiers with firearms or sidearms of any description, liable to go off at any time, which was tantamount to inciting them against civilians should by any chance they fall nut over anything. You frittered away your time, he very sensibly maintained, and health and also character besides which the squandermania of the thing, fast women of the demimonde ran away with a lot of #. s. d. into the bargain and the greatest danger of all was who you got drunk with though, touching the much vexed question of stimulants, he relished a glass of choice old wine in season as both nourishing and blood-making and possessing aperient virtues (notably a good burgundy which he was a staunch believer in) still never beyond a certain point where he invariably drew the line as it simply led to trouble all round to say nothing of your being at the tender mercy of others practically. Most of all he commented adversely on the desertion of Stephen by all his pubhunting confr√®res but one, a most glaring piece of ratting on the part of his brother medicos under all the circs.
‚ÄîAnd that one was Judas, said Stephen, who up to then had said nothing whatsoever of any kind.
Discussing these and kindred topics they made a beeline across the back of the Customhouse and passed under the Loop Line bridge when a brazier of coke burning in front of a sentrybox, or something like one, attracted their rather lagging footsteps. Stephen of his own accord stopped for no special reason to look at the heap of barren cobblestones and by the light emanating from the brazier he could just make out the darker figure of the corporation watchman inside the gloom of the sentrybox. He began to remember that this had happened, or had been mentioned as having happened, before but it cost him no small effort before he remembered that he recognised in the sentry a quondam friend of his father's Gumley. To avoid a meeting be drew nearer to the pillars of the railway bridge.
‚ÄîSomeone saluted you, Mr Bloom said.
A figure of middle height on the prowl, evidently, under the arches saluted again, calling: Night! Stephen, of course, started rather dizzily and stopped to return the compliment. Mr Bloom, actuated by motives of inherent delicacy, inasmuch as he always believed in minding his own business, moved off but nevertheless remained on the qui vive with just a shade of anxiety though not funkyish in the least. Although unusual in the Dublin area, he knew that it was not by any means unknown for desperadoes who had next to nothing to live on to be about waylaying and generally terrorising peaceable pedestrians by placing a pistol at their head in some secluded spot outside the city proper, famished loiterers of the Thames embankment category they might be hanging about there or simply marauders ready to decamp with whatever boodle they could in one fell swoop at a moments notice, your money or your life, leaving you there to point a moral, gagged and garotted.
Stephen, that is when the accosting figure came to close quarters, though he was not in any over sober state himself, recognised Corley's breath redolent of rotten cornjuice. Lord John Corley, some called him, and his genealogy came about in this wise. He was the eldest son of Inspector Corley of the G Division, lately deceased, who had married a certain Katherine Brophy, the daughter of a Louth farmer. His grandfather, Patrick Michael Corley, of New Ross, had married the widow of a publican there whose maiden name had been Katherine (also) Talbot. Rumour had it, though not proved, that she descended from the house of the Lords Talbot de Malahide in whose mansion, really an unquestionably fine residence of its kind and well worth seeing, his mother or aunt or some relative had enjoyed the distinction of being in service in the washkitchen. This, therefore, was the reason why the still comparatively young though dissolute man who now addressed Stephen was spoken of by some with facetious proclivities as Lord John Corley.
Taking Stephen on one side he had the customary doleful ditty to tell. Not as much as a farthing to purchase a night's lodgings. His friends had all deserted him. Furthermore, he had a row with Lenehan and called him to Stephen a mean bloody swab with a sprinkling of other uncalled-for expressions. He was out of a job and implored of Stephen to tell him where on God's earth he could get something, anything at all to do. No, it was the daughter of the mother in the washkitchen that was fostersister to the heir of the house or else they were connected through the mother in some way, both occurrences happening at the same time if the whole thing wasn't a complete fabrication from start to finish. Anyhow, he was ill in.
‚ÄîI wouldn't ask you, only, pursued he, on my solemn oath and God knows I'm on the rocks.
‚ÄîThere'll be a job tomorrow or the next day, Stephen told him, in a boys' school at Dalkey for a gentleman usher. Mr Garret Deasy. Try it. You may mention my name.
‚ÄîAh, God, Corley replied, sure I couldn't teach in a school, man. I was never one of your bright ones, he added with a half laugh. Got stuck twice in the junior at the Christian Brothers.
‚ÄîI have no place to sleep myself, Stephen informed him.
Corley, at the first go-off, was inclined to suspect it was something to do with Stephen being fired out of his digs for bringing in a bloody tart off the street. There was a dosshouse in Marlborough street, Mrs Maloney's, but it was only a tanner touch and full of undesirables but M'Conachie told him you got a decent enough do in the Brazen Head over in Winetavern street (which was distantly suggestive to the person addressed of friar Bacon) for a bob. He was starving too though he hadn't said a word about it.
Though this sort of thing went on every other night or very near it still Stephen's feelings got the better of him in a sense though he knew that Corley's brandnew rigmarole, on a par with the others, was hardly deserving of much credence. However, haud ignarus malorum miseris succurrere disco, etcetera, as the Latin poet remarks, especially as luck would have it he got paid his screw after every middle of the month on the sixteenth which was the date of the month as a matter of fact though a good bit of the wherewithal was demolished. But the cream of the joke was nothing would get it Out of Corley's head that he was living in affluence and hadn't a thing to do but hand out the needful - whereas. He put his hand in a pocket anyhow, not with the idea of finding any food there, but thinking he might lend him anything up to a bob or so in lieu so that he might endeavour at all events and get sufficient to eat. But the result was in the negative for, to his chagrin, he found his cash missing. A few broken biscuits were all the result of his investigation. He tried his hardest to recollect for the moment whether he had lost, as well he might have, or left, because in that contingency it was not a pleasant lookout, very much the reverse, in fact. He was altogether too fagged out to institute a thorough search though he tried to recollect about biscuits he dimly remembered. Who now exactly gave them, or where was, or did he buy? However, in another pocket he came across what he surmised in the dark were pennies, erroneously, however, as it turned out.
‚ÄîThose are halfcrowns, man, Corley corrected him.
And so in point of fact they turned out to be. Stephen lent him one of them.
‚ÄîThanks, Corley answered. You're a gentleman. I'll pay you back some time. Who's that with you? I saw him a few times in the Bleeding Horse in Camden street with Boylan the billsticker. You might put in a good word for us to get me taken on there. I'd carry a sandwichboard only the girl in the office told me they're full up for the next three weeks, man. God, you've to book ahead, man, you'd think it was for the Carl Rosa. I don't give a shite anyway so long as I get a job even as a crossing sweeper.
Subsequently, being not quite so down in the mouth after the two-and-six he got, he informed Stephen about a fellow by the name of Bags Comisky that he said Stephen knew well out of Fullam's, the shipchandler's bookkeeper there, that used to be often round in Nagle's back with O'Mara and a little chap with a stutter the name of Tighe. Anyhow, he was lagged the night before last and fined ten bob for a drunk and disorderly and refusing to go with the constable.
Mr Bloom in the meanwhile kept dodging about in the vicinity of the cobblestones near the brazier of coke in front of the corporation watchman's sentrybox, who, evidently a glutton for work, it struck him, was having a quiet forty winks for all intents and purposes on his own private account while Dublin slept. He threw an odd eye at the same time now and then at Stephen's anything but immaculately attired interlocutor as if he had seen that nobleman somewhere or other though where he was not in a position to truthfully state nor had he the remotest idea when. Being a levelheaded individual who could give points to not a few in point of shrewd observation, he also remarked on his very dilapidated hat and slouchy wearing apparel generally, testifying to a chronic impecuniosity. Probably he was one of his hangerson but for the matter of that it was merely a question of one preying on his next door neighbour all round, in every deep, so to put it, a deeper depth and for the matter of that if the man in the street chanced to be in the dock himself penal servitude, with or without the option of a fine, would be a very rara avis altogether. In any case he had a consummate amount of cool assurance intercepting people at that hour of the night or morning. Pretty thick that was certainly.
The pair parted company and Stephen rejoined Mr Bloom, who, with his practised eye, was not without perceiving that he had succumbed to the blandiloquence of the other parasite. Alluding to the encounter he said, laughingly, Stephen, that is:
‚ÄîHe's down on his luck. He asked me to ask you to ask somebody named Boylan, a billsticker, to give him a job as a sandwichman.
At this intelligence, in which he seemingly evinced little interest, Mr Bloom gazed abstractedly for the space of a half a second or so in the direction of a bucket dredger, rejoicing in the farfamed name of Eblana, moored alongside Customhouse Quay and quite possibly Out of repair, whereupon he observed evasively:
‚ÄîEverybody gets their own ration of luck, they say. Now you mention it his face was familiar to me. But leaving that for the moment, how much did you part with, he queried, if I am not too inquisitive?
‚ÄîHalf-a-crown, Stephen responded. I daresay he needs it to sleep somewhere.
‚ÄîNeeds, Mr Bloom ejaculated, professing not the least surprise at the intelligence, I can quite credit the assertion and I guarantee he invariably does. Everyone according to his needs and everyone according to his deeds. But talking about things in general, where, added he with a smile, will you sleep yourself? Walking to Sandycove is Out of the question and, even supposing you did, you won't get in after what occurred at Westland Row station. Simply fag out there for nothing. I don't mean to presume to dictate to you in the slightest degree but why did you leave your father's house?
‚ÄîTo seek misfortune, was Stephen's answer.
‚ÄîI met your respected father on a recent occasion, Mr Bloom diplomatically returned. Today, in fact, or, to be strictly accurate, on yesterday. Where does he live at present? I gathered in the course of conversation that he had moved.
‚ÄîI believe he is in Dublin somewhere, Stephen answered unconcernedly. Why?
‚ÄîA gifted man, Mr Bloom said of Mr Dedalus senior, in more respects than one and a born raconteur if ever there was one. He takes great pride, quite legitimately, Out of you. You could go back, perhaps, he hazarded, still thinking of the very unpleasant scene at Westland Row terminus when it was perfectly evident that the other two, Mulligan, that is, and that English tourist friend of his, who eventually euchred their third companion, were patently trying, as if the whole bally station belonged to them, to give Stephen the slip in the confusion.
There was no response forthcoming to the suggestion, however, such as it was, Stephen's mind's eye being too busily engaged in repicturing his family hearth the last time he saw it, with his sister, Dilly, sitting by the ingle, her hair hanging down, waiting for some weak Trinidad shell cocoa that was in the sootcoated kettle to be done so that she and he could drink it with the oatmeal water for milk after the Friday herrings they had eaten at two a penny, with an egg apiece for Maggy, Boody and Katey, the cat meanwhile under the mangle devouring a mess of eggshells and charred fish heads and bones on a square of brown paper in accordance with the third precept of the church to fast and abstain on the days commanded, it being quarter tense or, if not, ember days or something like that.
‚ÄîNo, Mr Bloom repeated again, I wouldn't personally repose much trust in that boon companion of yours who contributes the humorous element, Dr Mulligan, as a guide, philosopher, and friend, if I were in your shoes. He knows which side his bread is buttered on though in all probability he never realised what it is to be without regular meals. Of course you didn't notice as much as I did but it wouldn't occasion me the least surprise to learn that a pinch of tobacco or some narcotic was put in your drink for some ulterior object.
He understood, however, from all he heard, that Dr Mulligan was a versatile allround man, by no means confined to medicine only, who was rapidly coming to the fore in his line and, if the report was verified, bade fair to enjoy a flourishing practice in the not too distant future as a tony medical practitioner drawing a handsome fee for his services in addition to which professional status his rescue of that man from certain drowning by artificial respiration and what they call first aid at Skerries, or Malahide was it? was, he was bound to admit, an exceedingly plucky deed which he could not too highly praise, so that frankly he was utterly at a loss to fathom what earthly reason could be at the back of it except he put it down to sheer cussedness or jealousy, pure and simple.
‚ÄîExcept it simply amounts to one thing and he is what they call picking your brains, he ventured to throw out.
The guarded glance of half solicitude, half curiosity, augmented by friendliness, which he gave at Stephen's at present morose expression of features did not throw a flood of light, none at all in fact, on the problem as to whether he had let himself be badly bamboozled, to judge by two or three low spirited remarks he let drop, or, the other way about, saw through the affair, and, for some reason or other best known to himself, allowed matters to more or less... Grinding poverty did have that effect and he more than conjectured that, high educational abilities though he possessed, he experienced no little difficulty in making both ends meet.
Adjacent to the men's public urinal he perceived an icecream car round which a group of presumably Italians in heated altercation were getting rid of voluble expressions in their vivacious language in a particularly animated way, there being some little differences between the parties.
‚ÄîPutana madonna, che ci dia i quattrini! Ho ragione? Culo rotto!
‚ÄîIntendiamoci. Mezzo sovrano pi√π
‚ÄîDice lui, pero.
‚ÄîFarabutto! Mortacci sui!
Mr Bloom and Stephen entered the cabman's shelter, an unpretentious wooden structure, where, prior to then, he had rarely, if ever, been before; the former having previously whispered to the latter a few hints anent the keeper of it, said to be the once famous Skin-the-Goat, Fitzharris, the invincible, though he wouldn't vouch for the actual facts, which quite possibly there was not one vestige of truth in. A few moments later saw our two noctambules safely seated in a discreet corner, only to be greeted by stares from the decidedly miscellaneous collection of waifs and strays and other nondescript specimens of the genus homo, already there engaged in eating and drinking, diversified by conversation, for whom they seemingly formed an object of marked curiosity.
‚ÄîNow touching a cup of coffee, Mr Bloom ventured to plausibly suggest to break the ice, it occurs to me you ought to sample something in the shape of solid food, say a roll of some description.
Accordingly his first act was with characteristic sangfroid to order these commodities quietly. The hoi polloi of jarvies or stevedores, or whatever they were, after a cursory examination, turned their eyes, apparently dissatisfied, away, though one redbearded bibulous individual, a portion of whose hair was greyish, a sailor, probably, still stared for some appreciable time before transferring his rapt attention to the floor.
Mr Bloom, availing himself of the right of free speech, he having just a bowing acquaintance with the language in dispute though, to be sure, rather in a quandary over voglio, remarked to his prot√©g√© in an audible tone of voice, apropos of the battle royal in the street which was still raging fast and furious:
‚ÄîBeautiful language. I mean for singing purposes. Why do you not write your poetry in that language? Bella Poetria! it is so melodious and full. Belladonna voglio.
Stephen, who was trying his dead best to yawn, if he could, suffering from dead lassitude generally, replied:
‚ÄîTo fill the ear of a cow elephant. They were haggling over money.
‚ÄîIs that so? Mr Bloom asked. Of course, he subjoined pensively, at the inward reflection of there being more languages to start with than were absolutely necessary, it may be only the southern glamour that surrounds it.
The keeper of the shelter in the middle of this t√™te-√†-t√™te put a boiling swimming cup of a choice concoction labelled coffee on the table and a rather antediluvian specimen of a bun, or so it seemed, after which he beat a retreat to his counter. Mr Bloom determining to have a good square look at him later on so as not to appear to... for which reason he encouraged Stephen to proceed with his eyes while he did the honours by surreptitiously pushing the cup of what was temporarily supposed to be called coffee gradually nearer him.
‚ÄîSounds are impostures, Stephen said after a pause of some little time. Like names, Cicero, Podmore, Napoleon, Mr Goodbody, Jesus, Mr Doyle. Shakespeares were as common as Murphies. What's in a name?
‚ÄîYes, to be sure, Mr Bloom unaffectedly concurred. Of course. Our name was changed too, he added, pushing the socalled roll across.
The redbearded sailor, who had his weather eye on the newcomers, boarded Stephen, whom he had singled out for attention in particular, squarely by asking:
‚ÄîAnd what might your name be?
Just in the nick of time Mr Bloom touched his companion's boot but Stephen, apparently disregarding the warm pressure, from an unexpected quarter, answered:
‚ÄîDedalus.
The sailor stared at him heavily from a pair of drowsy baggy eyes, rather bunged up from excessive use of boose, preferably good old Hollands and water.
‚ÄîYou know Simon Dedalus? he asked at length.
‚ÄîI've heard of him, Stephen said.
Mr Bloom was all at sea for a moment, seeing the others evidently eavesdropping too.
‚ÄîHe's Irish, the seaman bold affirmed, staring still in much the same way and nodding. All Irish.
‚ÄîAll too Irish, Stephen rejoined.
As for Mr Bloom he could neither make head or tail of the whole business and he was just asking himself what possible connection when the sailor, of his own accord, turned to the other Occupants of the shelter with the remark: I seen him shoot two eggs off two bottles at fifty yards over his shoulder. The left hand dead shot.
Though he was slightly hampered by an occasional stammer and his gestures being also clumsy as it was still he did his best to explain.
‚ÄîBottle Out there, say. Fifty yards measured. Eggs on the bottles. Cocks his gun over his shoulder. Aims.
He turned his body half round, shut up his right eye completely, then he screwed his features up some way sideways and glared out into the night with an unprepossessing cast of countenance.
‚ÄîPom, he then shouted once.
The entire audience waited, anticipating an additional detonation, there being still a further egg.
‚ÄîPom, he shouted twice.
Egg two evidently demolished, he nodded and winked, adding bloodthirstily:
Buffalo Bill shoots to kill,
Never missed nor he never will.
A silence ensued till Mr Bloom for agreeableness' sake just felt like asking him whether it was for a marksmanship competition like the Bisley.
‚ÄîBeg pardon, the sailor said.
‚ÄîLong ago? Mr Bloom pursued without flinching a hairsbreadth.
‚ÄîWhy, the sailor replied, relaxing to a certain extent under the magic influence of diamond cut diamond, it might be a matter of ten years. He toured the wide world with Hengler's Royal Circus. I seen him do that in Stockholm.
‚ÄîCurious coincidence, Mr Bloom confided to Stephen unobtrusively.
‚ÄîMurphy's my name, the sailor continued, W. B. Murphy, of Carrigaloe. Know where that is?
‚ÄîQueenstown Harbour, Stephen replied.
‚ÄîThat's right, the sailor said. Fort Camden and Fort Carlisle. That's where I hails from. My little woman's down there. She's waiting for me, I know. For England, home and beauty. She's my own true wife I haven't seen for seven years now, sailing about.
Mr Bloom could easily picture his advent on this scene - the homecoming to the mariner's roadside shieling after having diddled Davy Jones - a rainy night with a blind moon. Across the world for a wife. Quite a number of stories there were on that particular Alice Ben Bolt topic, Enoch Arden and Rip van Winkle and does anybody hereabouts remember Caoc O'Leary, a favourite and most trying declamation piece, by the way, of poor John Casey and a bit of perfect poetry in its own small way? Never about the runaway wife coming back, however much devoted to the absentee. The face at the window! Judge of his astonishment when he finally did breast the tape and the awful truth dawned upon him anent his better half, wrecked in his affections. You little expected me but I've come to stay and make a fresh start. There she sits, a grass widow, at the selfsame fireside. Believes me dead. Rocked in the cradle of the deep. And there sits uncle Chubb or Tomkin, as the case might be, the publican of the Crown and Anchor, in shirtsleeves, eating rumpsteak and onions. No chair for father. Boo! The wind! Her brandnew arrival is on her knee, post mortem child. With a high ro! and a randy ro! and my galloping tearing tandy O! Bow to the inevitable. Grin and bear it. I remain with much love your brokenhearted husband, W. B. Murphy.
The sailor, who scarcely seemed to be a Dublin resident, turned to one of the jarvies with the request:
‚ÄîYou don't happen to have such a thing as a spare chaw about you, do you?
The jarvey addressed, as it happened, had not but the keeper took a die of plug from his good jacket hanging on a nail and the desired object was passed from hand to hand.
‚ÄîThank you, the sailor said.
He deposited the quid in his gob and, chewing, and with some slow stammers, proceeded:
‚ÄîWe come up this morning eleven o'clock. The threemaster Rosevean from Bridgwater with bricks. I shipped to get over. Paid off this afternoon. There's my discharge. See? W. B. Murphy, A. B. S.
In confirmation of which statement he extricated from an inside pocket and handed to his neighbours a not very clean looking folded document.
‚ÄîYou must have seen a fair share of the world, the keeper remarked, leaning on the counter.
‚ÄîWhy, the sailor answered, upon reflection upon it, I've circumnavigated a bit since I first joined on. I was in the Red Sea. I was in China and North America and South America. I seen icebergs plenty, growlers. I was in Stockholm and the Black Sea, the Dardanelles, under Captain Dalton the best bloody man that ever scuttled a ship. I seen Russia. Gospodi pomilooy. That's how the Russians prays.
‚ÄîYou seen queer sights, don't be talking, put in a jarvey.
‚ÄîWhy, the sailor said, shifting his partially chewed plug, I seen queer things too, ups and downs. I seen a crocodile bite the fluke of an anchor same as I chew that quid.
He took out of his mouth the pulpy quid and, lodging it between his teeth, bit ferociously.
‚ÄîKhaan! Like that. And I seen maneaters in Peru that eats corpses and the livers of horses. Look here. Here they are. A friend of mine sent me.
He fumbled out a picture postcard from his inside pocket, which seemed to be in its way a species of repository, and pushed it along the table. The printed matter on it stated: Choza de Indios. Beni, Bolivia.
All focused their attention on the scene exhibited, at a group of savage women in striped loincloths, squatted, blinking, suckling, frowning, sleeping, amid a swarm of infants (there must have been quite a score of them) outside some primitive shanties of osier.
‚ÄîChews coca all day long, the communicative tarpaulin added. Stomachs like breadgraters. Cuts off their diddies when they can't bear no more children. See them there stark ballocknaked eating a dead horse's liver raw.
His postcard proved a centre of attraction for Messrs the greenhorns for several minutes, if not more.
‚ÄîKnow how to keep them off? he inquired genially.
Nobody volunteering a statement, he winked, saying:
‚ÄîGlass. That boggles 'em. Glass.
Mr Bloom, without evincing surprise, unostentatiously turned over the card to peruse the partially obliterated address and postmark. It ran as follows: Tarjeta Postal. Se√±or A. Boudin, Galeria Becche, Santiago, Chile. There was no message evidently, as he took particular notice. Though not an implicit believer in the lurid story narrated (or the eggsniping transaction for that matter despite William Tell and the Lazarillo-Don Cesar de Bazan incident depicted in Maritana on which occasion the former's ball passed through the latter's hat), having detected a discrepancy between his name (assuming he was the person he represented himself to be and not sailing under false colours after having boxed the compass on the strict q.t. somewhere) and the fictitious addressee of the missive which made him nourish some suspicions of our friend's bona fides, nevertheless it reminded him in a way of a longcherished plan he meant to one day realise some Wednesday or Saturday of travelling to London via long sea not to say that he had ever travelled extensively to any great extent but he was at heart a born adventurer though by a trick of fate he had consistently remained a landlubber except you call going to Holyhead which was his longest. Martin Cunningham frequently said he would work a pass through",en,LABEL_0,0.512096643447876,LABEL_1,0.4879033863544464

From proms to weddings to baby showers, once that DJ starts to spin, there's something about that cavernous echo that begs to be filled with sing-along dance tunes. Top 40 hits come and go, and no doubt there will be plenty of those contemporary tunes throughout the evening, but there are few songs that are as fun now as they were the first time. Not only do they never go out of style, they are essential components of the perfect hoe-down in all banquet halls.
1. The Chicken Dance
This song is a great opener to get the crowd going. Even the stiffest old timers can't help but get up and shake a leg when this song comes on. And what could be cuter than a gaggle of little kids all wiggling their tail feathers and squawking like chicks? This is a great song for a country-themed wedding.
2. Macarena, by Los Dos Rios
A major craze when first released in 1995, the Macarena will keep the energy up, up, up. The simple dance moves and catchy tune are an irresistible combination, and the Latin flavor will be a welcome change of beat.
3. Dancing Queen, by ABBA
Light-hearted and bubbly, Dancing Queen is a must-have for any occasion where free spirits are blooming and the night is young. Dancing Queen was written for the royal Swedish wedding in 1976, but its candy-sweet ebullience is as fresh as ever. This song has gone on to be a romantic staple at just about every wedding in the U.S.
4. My Heart Will Go On, by Celine Dion
The words are simple, the feeling is big. Lost love is in the air, and nobody ever said it better than Celine. Play this song later in the night, after a few glasses of wine have everyone misty-eyed and ready to belt out, ""My heart will go on and OOOOOOON!"" with Celine.
5. Don't Stop Believin, by Journey
The ultimate crowd-pleaser, bring the mood up again with Journey's quintessential Americana midnight adventure song. Fists will pump and memories of late-night train rides and midnight diner trysts will flood back. Even though this song came out in 1981, it still plays on the radio often enough that kids who weren't even born then know the words. It's a great goodbye, goodnight, and see you on the road song.
These time-honored tunes have been staples of banquet halls for decades because they've got that timeless jive that keeps them fresh. They are sure to bring back old memories and inspire new ones.
riage, first gave sign
Unto his contract; fire and air did shine,
As guilty of the match; and from the hill
The nymphs with shriekings do the region fill.
Here first began their bane; this day was ground
Of all their ills; for now, nor rumour's sound,
Nor nice respect of state, moves Dido ought;
Her love no longer now by stealth is sought:
She calls this wedlock, and with that fair name
Covers her fault. Forthwith the bruit and fame,
Through all the greatest Lybian towns is gone;
Fame, a fleet evil, than which is swifter none,
That moving grows, and flying gathers strength,
Little at first, and fearful; but at length
She dares attempt the skies, and stalking proud
With feet on ground, her head doth pierce a cloud!
This child, our parent earth, stirr'd up with spite
Of all the gods, brought forth; and, as some write,
She was last sister of that giant race
That thought to scale Jove' s court; right swift of pace,
And swifter far of wing; a monster vast,
And dreadful. Look, how many plumes are placed
On her huge corps, so many waking eyes
Stick underneath; and, which may stranger rise
In the report, as many tongues she bears,
As many mouths, as many listening ears.
Nightly, in midst of all the heaven, she flies,
And through the earth's dark shadow shrieking cries,
Nor do her eyes once bend to taste sweet sleep;
By day on tops of houses she doth keep,
Or on high towers; and doth thence affright
Cities and towns of most conspicuous site:
As covetous she is of tales and lies,
As prodigal of truth: this monster‚Äî

Lup.
 I pronounce you all traitors, horrible traitors:
What! do you know my affairs? I have matter of danger and state to impart to Caesar.
Caes.
What noise is there? who's that names Caesar?
Lup.
 A friend to Caesar. One that, for Caesar's good,
would speak with Caesar.
Caes.
Who is it? look, Cornelius.
1 Eques.
 Asinius Lupus.
Caes.
O, bid the turbulent informer hence;
We have no vacant ear now, to receive
The unseason'd fruits of his officious tongue.
Mec.
You must avoid him there.
Lup.
 I conjure thee, as thou art. Caesar, or respectest
thine own safety, or the safety of the state, Caesar, hear me,
speak with me, Caesar; 'tis no common business I come about, but
such, as being neglected, may concern the life of Caesar.
Caes.
The life of Caesar! Let him enter. Virgil, keep thy seat.
Enter Lupus, Tucca, and Lictors.
Eques.
 Bear back, there: whither will you? keep back!
Tuc.

Lup.
Lay hold on Horace there; and on Mecaenas, lictors. Romans,
offer no rescue, upon your allegiance: read, royal Caesar.
 I'll tickle you, Satyr.
Tuc.
He will, Humours, he will; he will squeeze you, poet
puck-fist.
Lup.
I'll lop you off for an unprofitable branch, you satirical
varlet.
Tuc.
Ay, and Epaminondas your patron here, with his flagon chain;
come, resign:  though 'twere your great grandfather's, the law has made it mine now, sir. Look to him, my party-coloured rascals; look to him.
Caes.
What is this, Asinius Lupus? I understand it not.
Lup.
Not understand it! A libel, Caesar; a dangerous, seditious
libel; a libel in picture.
Caes.
A libel!
Lup.
Ay, I found it in this Horace his study, in Mecaenas his
house, here; I challenge the penalty of the laws against them.
Tuc.
Ay, and remember to beg their land betimes; before some of
these hungry court-hounds scent it out.
Caes.
Shew it to Horace: ask him if he know it.
Lup.
Know it! his hand is at it, Caesar.
Caes.
Then 'tis no libel.
Hor.
It is the imperfect body of an emblem, Caesar, I began for
Mecaenas.
Lup.
An emblem! right: that's Greek for a libel. Do but mark how
confident he is.
Hor.
A just man cannot fear, thou foolish tribune;
Not, though the malice of traducing tongues,
The open vastness of a tyrant's ear,
The senseless rigour of the wrested laws,
Or the red eyes of strain'd authority,
Should, in a point, meet all to take his life:
His innocence is armour 'gainst all these.
Lup.
Innocence! O impudence! let me see, let me see! Is not here an
eagle! and is not that eagle meant by Caesar, ha? Does not Caesar
give the eagle? answer me; what sayest thou?
Tuc.
Hast thou any evasion, stinkard?
Lup.
Now he's turn'd dumb. I'll tickle you, Satyr.
Hor.
Pish: ha, ha!
Lup.
Dost thou pish me? Give me my long sword.
Hor.
With reverence to great Caesar, worthy Romans,
Observe but this ridiculous commenter;
The soul 'to my device was in this distich:
Thus oft, the base and ravenous multitude
Survive, to share the spoils of fortitude.
Which in this body I have figured here,
A vulture‚Äî
Lup.
A vulture! Ay, now, 'tis a vulture. O abominable! monstrous!
monstrous! has not your vulture a beak? has it not legs, and
talons, and wings, and feathers?
Tuc.
Touch him, old buskins.
Hor.
And therefore must it be an eagle?
Mec.
Respect him not, good Horace: say your device.
Hor.
A vulture and a wolf
Lup.
A wolf! good: that's I; I am the wolf: my name's Lupus; I am
meant by the wolf. On, on; a vulture and a wolf
Hor.
Preying upon the carcass of an ass‚Äî
Lup.
An ass! good still: that's I too; I am the ass. You mean me by
the ass.
Mec.
Prithee, leave braying then.
Hor.
If you will needs take it, I cannot with modesty give it from
you.
Mec.
But, by that beast, the old Egyptians
Were wont to figure, in their hieroglyphics,
Patience, frugality, and fortitude;
For none of which we can suspect you, tribune.
Caes.
Who was it, Lupus, that inform'd you first, This should be
meant by us? Or was't your comment?
Lup.
No, Caesar; a player gave me the first light of it indeed.
Tuc.
Ay, an honest sycophant-like slave, and a politician besides
Caes.
Where is that player?
Tuc.
He is without here.
Caes.
Call him in.
Tuc.
Call in the player there: master AEsop, call him.
Equites.
 Player! where is the player? bear back: none but
the player enter.
[Enter AESOP, followed by CRISPINUS and DEMETRIUS.
Tuc.
Yes, this gentleman and his Achates must.
Cris.
Pray you, master usher:‚Äîwe'll stand close, here.
Tuc.
'Tis a gentleman of quality, this; though he be somewhat out
of clothes, I tell ye.‚ÄîCome, AEsop, hast a bay-leaf in thy mouth?
Well said; be not out, stinkard. Thou shalt have a monopoly of
playing confirm'd to thee, and thy covey, under the emperor's broad seal, for this service.
Caes.
Is this he?
Lup.
Ay, Caesar, this is he.
Caes.
Let him be whipped. Lictors, go take him hence.
And, Lupus, for your fierce credulity,
One fit him with a pair of larger ears:
'Tis Caesar's doom, and must not be revoked.
We hate to have our court and peace disturb'd
With these quotidian clamours. See it done.
Lup.
Caesar! 
[Exeunt some of the Lictors, with Lupus and AEsop
Caes.
Gag him,  we may have his silence.
Virg.
Caesar hath done like Caesar. Fair and just
Is his award, against these brainless creatures.
'Tis not the wholesome sharp morality,
Or modest anger of a satiric spirit,
That hurts or wounds the body of the state;
But the sinister application
Of the malicious, ignorant, and base
Interpreter; who will distort, and strain
The general scope and purpose of an author
To his particular and private spleen.
Caes.
We know it, our dear Virgil, and esteem it
A most dishonest practice in that man,
Will seem too witty in another's work.
What would Cornelius Gallus, and Tibullus?
[They whisper Caesar.
Tuc.
 Nay, but as thou art a man, dost hear! a man
of worship and honourable: hold, here, take thy chain again.
Resume, mad Mecoenas. What! dost thou think I meant to have kept it, old boy? no: I did it but to fright thee, I, to try how thou
would'st take it. What! will I turn shark upon my friends, or my
friends' friends? I scorn it with my three souls. Come, I love
bully Horace as well as thou dost, I: 'tis an honest hieroglyphic.
Give me thy wrist, Helicon. Dost thou think I'll second e'er a
rhinoceros of them all, against thee, ha? or thy noble Hippocrene,
here? I'll turn stager first, and be whipt too: dost thou see,
bully?
Caes.
You have your will of Caesar: use it, Romans.
Virgil shall be your praetor: and ourself
Will here sit by, spectator of your sports;
And think it no impeach of royalty.
Our ear is now too much profaned, grave Maro,
With these distastes, to take thy sacred lines;
Put up thy book, till both the time and we
Be fitted with more hallow'd circumstance
For the receiving of so divine a work.
Proceed with your design.
Mec. Gal. Tib.
Thanks to great Caesar.
Gal.
Tibullus, draw you the indictment then, whilst Horace arrests
them on the statute of Calumny. Mecaenas and I will take our
places here. Lictors, assist him.
Hor.
I am the worst accuser under heaven.
Gal.
Tut, you must do it; 'twill be noble mirth.
Hor.
I take no knowledge that they do malign me.
Tib.
Ay, but the world takes knowledge.
Hor.
Would the world knew
How heartily I wish a fool should hate me!
Tuc.
Body of Jupiter! what! will they arraign my brisk Poetaster
and his poor journeyman, ha? Would I were abroad skeldering for, a drachm, so I were out of this labyrinth again! I do feel myself
turn stinkard already: but I must set the best face I have upon't
now.
‚ÄîWell said, my divine, deft Horace, bring the whoreson detracting slaves to the bar, do; make them hold up their spread golls: I'll give in evidence for thee, if thou wilt. Take courage, Crlspinus; would thy man had a clean band!
Cris.
What must we do, captain?
Tuc.
Thou shalt see anon: do not make division with thy legs so.
Caes.
What's he. Horace?
Hor.
I only know him for a motion, Caesar.
Tuc.
I am one of thy commanders, Caesar; a man of service and
action: my name is Pantilius Tucca; I have served in thy wars
against Mark Antony, I.
Caes.
Do you know him, Cornelius?
Gal.
He's one that hath had the mustering, or convoy of a company
now and then: I never noted him by any other employment.
Caes.
We will observe him better.
Tib.
Lictor, proclaim silence in the court.
Lict.
In the name of Caesar, silence!
Tib.
Let the parties, the accuser and the accused, present
themselves.
Lict.
The accuser and the accused, present yourselves in court.
Cris.
Dem. Here.
Virg.
Read the indictment.
Tib.
Rufus Laberius Crispinus, and Demetrius Fannius, hold up your
hands. You are, before this time, jointly and severally indicted,
and here presently to be arraigned upon the statute of calumny, or
Lex Remmia, the one by the name of Rufus Laberius Crispinus, alias
Cri-spinus, poetaster and plagiary, the other by the name of
Demetrius Fannius, play-dresser and plagiary. That you (not having
the fear of Phoebus, or his shafts, before your eyes) contrary to
the peace of our liege lord, Augustus Caesar, his crown and
dignity, and against the form of a statute, in that case made and
provided, have moat ignorantly, foolishly, and, more like
yourselves, maliciously, gone about to deprave, and calumniate the
person and writings of Quintus Horatius Flaccus, here present,
poet, and priest to the Muses, and to that end have mutually
conspired and plotted, at sundry times, as by several means, and in
sundry places, for the better accomplishing your base and envious
purpose, taxing him falsely, of self-love, arrogancy, impudence,
railing, filching by translation, etc. Of all which calumnies, and
every of them, in manner and form aforesaid, what answer you! Are you guilty, or not guilty?
Tuc.
Not guilty, say.
Cris.
Dem. Not guilty.
Tib.
How will you be tried?
[Aside to Crispinus.
Tuc.
By the Roman Gods, and the noblest Romans.
Cris.
Dem. By the Roman gods, and the noblest Romans.
Virg.
Here sits Mecaenas, and Cornelius Gallus, are you contented
to be tried by these?
[Aside.
Tuc.
Ay, so the noble captain may be joined with them in
commission, say.
Cris.
Dem. Ay, so the noble captain may be joined
with them in commission.
Virg.
What says the plaintiff?
Hor.
I am content.
Virg.
Captain, then take your place.
Tuc.
alas, my worshipful praetor! 'tis more of thy gentleness than
of my deserving, I wusse. But since it hath pleased the court to
make choice of my wisdom and gravity, come, my calumnious
varlets; let's hear you talk for yourselves, now, an hour or two.
What can you say? Make a noise. Act, act!
Virg.
Stay, turn, and take an oath first. You shall swear,
By thunder-darting Jove, the king of gods,
And by the genius of Augustus Caesar;
By your own white and uncorrupted souls,
And the deep reverence of our Roman justice;
To judge this case, with truth and equity:
As bound by your religion, and your laws.
Now read the evidence: but first demand
Of either prisoner, if that writ be theirs.
[Gives him two papers.
Tib.
Shew this unto Crispinus. Is it yours?
Tuc.
Say, ay. ‚ÄîWhat! dost thou stand upon it, pimp! Do not
deny thine own Minerva, thy Pallas, the issue of thy brain.
Oris.
Yes it is mine.
Tib.
Shew that unto Demetrius. Is it yours?
Dem.
It is.
Tuc.
There's a father will not deny his own bastard now, I warrant
thee.
Virg.
Read them aloud.
Tib.
Ramp up my genius, be not retrograde;
But boldly nominate a spade a spade
What, shall thy lubrical and glibbery muse
Live, as she were defunct, like punk in stews!
Tuc.
Excellent!
Alas! that were no modern consequence,
To have cothurnal buskins frighted hence.
No, teach thy Incubus to poetise;
And throw abroad thy spurious snotteries,
Upon that puft-up lump of balmy froth.
Tuc.
Ah, Ah!
Or clumsy chilblain'd judgment; that with oath
Magnificates his merit; and beapawls
The conscious time, with humorous foam and brawls,
As if his organons of sense would crack
The sinews of my patience. Break his back,
O poets all and some! for now we list
Of strenuous vengeance to clutch the fist.
CRISPINUS.
Tuc.
Ay, marry, this was written like a Hercules in poetry, now.
Caes.
Excellently well threaten'd!
Virg.
And as strangely worded, Caesar.
Caes.
We observe it.
Virg.
The other now.
Tuc.
This is a fellow of a good prodigal tongue too, this will do
well.
Tib.
Our Muse is in mind for th' untrussing a poet,
I slip by his name, for most men do know it:
A critic, that all the world bescumbers
With satirical humours and lyrical numbers:
Tuc.
Art thou there, boy?
And for the most part, himself doth advance
With much self-love, and more arrogance.
Tuc.
Good again!
And, but that I would not be thought a prater,
I could tell you he were a translator.
I know the authors from whence he has stole,
And could trace him too, but that
I understand them not full and whole.
Tuc.
That line is broke loose from all his fellows: chain him up
shorter, do.
The best note I can give you to know him by,
Is, that he keeps gallants' company;
Whom I could wish, in time should him fear,
Lest after they buy repentance too dear.
DEME. FANNIUS.
Tuc.
Well said! This carries palm with it.
Hor.
And why, thou motley gull, why should they fear!
When hast thou known us wrong or tax a friend?
I dare thy malice to betray it. Speak.
Now thou curl'st up, thou poor and nasty snake,
And shrink'st thy poisonous head into thy bosom:
Out, viper! thou that eat'st thy parents, hence!
Rather, such speckled creatures, as thyself,
Should be eschew'd, and shunn'd; such as will bite
And gnaw their absent friends, not cure their fame;
Catch at the loosest laughters, and affect
To be thought jesters; such as can devise
Things never seen, or head, t'impair men's names,
And gratify their credulous adversaries;
Will carry tales, do basest offices,
Cherish divided fires, and still encrease
New flames, out of old embers; will reveal
Each secret that's committed to their trust:
These be black slaves; Romans, take heed of these.
Tuc.
Thou twang'st right, little Horace: they be indeed a couple of
chap-fall'n curs. Come, we of the bench, let's rise to the urn, and
condemn them quickly.
Virg.
Before you go together, worthy Romans,
We are to tender our opinion;
And give you those instructions, that may add
Unto your even judgment in the cause:
Which thus we do commence. First, you must know,
That where there is a true and perfect merit,
There can be no dejection; and the scorn
Of humble baseness, oftentimes so works
In a high soul, upon the grosser spirit,
That to his bleared and offended sense,
There seems a hideous fault blazed in the object;
When only the disease is in his eyes.
Here-hence it comes our Horace now stands tax'd
Of impudence, self-love, and arrogance,
By those who share no merit in themselves;
And therefore think his portion is as small.
For they, from their own guilt, assure their souls,
If they should confidently praise their works,
In them it would appear inflation:
Which, in a full and well digested man,
Cannot receive that foul abusive name,
But the fair title of erection.
And, for his true use of translating men,
It still hath been a work of as much palm,
In clearest judgments, as to invent or make,
His sharpness,‚Äî-that is most excusable;
As being forced out of a suffering virtue,
Oppressed with the license of the time:‚Äî-
And howsoever fools or jerking pedants,
Players, or suchlike buffoon barking wits,
May with their beggarly and barren trash
Tickle base vulgar ears, in their despite;
This, like Jove's thunder, shall their pride control,
""The honest satire hath the happiest soul.""
Now, Romans, you have heard our thoughts;
withdraw when you please.
Tib.
Remove the accused from the bar.
Tuc.
Who holds the urn to us, ha? Fear nothing, I'll quit you, mine
honest pitiful stinkards; I'll do't.
Cris.
Captain, you shall eternally girt me to you, as I am
generous.
Tuc.
Go to.
Caes.
Tibullus, let there be a case of vizards privately provided;
we have found a subject to bestow them on.
Tib.
It shall be done, Caesar.
Caes.
Here be words, Horace, able to bastinado a man's ears.
Hor. Ay.
Please it, great Caesar, I have pills about me,
Mixt with the whitest kind of hellebore,
Would give him a light vomit, that should purge
His brain and stomach of those tumorous heats:
Might I have leave to minister unto him.
Caes.
O, be his AEsculapius, gentle Horace!
You shall have leave, and he shall be your patient. Virgil,
Use your authority, command him forth.
Virg.
Caesar is careful of your health, Crispinus;
And hath himself chose a physician
To minister unto you: take his pills.
Hor.
They are somewhat bitter, sir, but very wholesome.
Take yet another; so: stand by, they'll work anon.
Tib.
Romans, return to your several seats: lictors, bring forward
the urn; and set the accused to the bar.
Tuc.
Quickly, you whoreson egregious varlets; come forward. What!
shall we sit all day upon you? You make no more haste now, than a
beggar upon pattens; or a physician to a patient that has no money,
you pilchers.
Tib.
Rufus Laberius Crispinus, and Demetrius Fannius, hold up your
hands. You have, according to the Roman custom, put yourselves upon trial to the urn, for divers and sundry calumnies, whereof you
have, before this time, been indicted, and are now presently
arraigned: prepare yourselves to hearken to the verdict of your
tryers. Caius Cilnius Mecaenas pronounceth you, by this
hand-writing, guilty. Cornelius Gallus, guilty. Pantilius Tucca‚Äî
Tuc.
Parcel-guilty, I.
Dem.
He means himself; for it was he indeed
Suborn'd us to the calumny.
Tuc.
I, you whoreson cantharides! was it I?
Dem.
I appeal to your conscience, captain.
Tib.
Then you confess it now?
Dem.
I do, and crave the mercy of the court.
Tib.
What saith Crispinus?
Cris.
O, the captain, the captain‚Äî-
Bor.
My physic begins to work with my patient, I see.
Virg.
Captain, stand forth and answer.
Tuc.
Hold thy peace, poet praetor: I appeal from thee to Caesar, I.
Do me right, royal Caesar.
Caes.
Marry, and I will, sir.‚Äî-Lictors, gag him; do.
And put a case of vizards o'er his head,
That he may look bifronted, as he speaks.
Tuc.
Gods and fiends! Caesar! thou wilt not, Caesar, wilt thou?
Away, you whoreson vultures; away. You think I am a dead corps now, because Caesar is disposed to jest with a man of mark, or so. Hold  your hook'd talons out of my flesh, you inhuman harpies. Go to, do't. What! will the royal Augustus cast away a gentleman of
worship, a captain and a commander, for a couple of condemn'd
caitiff calumnious cargos?
Caes.
Dispatch, lictors.
Tuc. Caesar!
[The vizards are put upon him.
Caes.
Forward, Tibullus.
Virg.
Demand what cause they had to malign Horace.
Dem.
In troth, no great cause, not I, I must confess; but that he
kept better company, for the most part, than I; and that better men
loved him than loved me; and that his writings thrived better than
mine, and were better liked and graced: nothing else.
Virg.
Thus envious souls repine at others' good.
Hor.
If this be all, faith, I forgive thee freely.
Envy me still, so long as Virgil loves me,
Gallus, Tibullus, and the best-best Caesar,
My dear Mecaenas; while these, with many more,
Whose names I wisely slip, shall think me worthy
Their honour'd and adored society,
And read and love, prove and applaud my poems;
I would not wish but such as you should spite them.
Cris.
O‚Äî!
Tib.
How now, Crispinus? C
Cris.
O, I am sick‚Äî!
Hor.
A bason, a bason, quickly; our physic works. Faint not, man.
Cris.
O‚Äî‚Äî‚Äîretrograde‚Äî‚Äî‚Äîreciprocal‚Äî‚Äî‚Äîincubus.
Caes.
What's that, Horace?
Hor.
Retrograde, reciprocal, and incubus, are come up.
Gal.
Thanks be to Jupiter!
Cris.
O‚Äî‚Äî‚Äîglibbery‚Äî‚Äî‚Äîlubrical‚Äî‚Äî‚Äîdefunct‚Äî‚Äî‚ÄîO‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî!
Hor.
Well said; here's some store.
Virg.
What are they?
Hor.
Glibbery, lubrical, and defunct.
Gal.
O, they came up easy.
Cris.
O‚Äî‚Äî‚ÄîO‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî!
Tib.
What's that?
Hor.
Nothing yet.
Cris.
Magnificate‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
Mec.
Magnificate!  That came up somewhat hard.
Hor.
Ay. What cheer, Crispinus?
Cris.
O! I shall cast up my‚Äî‚Äî‚Äîspurious‚Äî‚Äî‚Äîsnotteries‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
Hor.
Good. Again.
Oris.
Chilblain'd‚Äî‚Äî‚ÄîO‚Äî‚Äî‚ÄîO‚Äî‚Äî‚Äîclumsie‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
Hor.
That clumsie stuck terribly.
Mec.
What's all that, Horace?
Hor.
Spurious, snotteries, chilblain'd, clumsie.
Tib.
O Jupiter!
Gal.
Who would have thought there should have been such a deal of
filth in a poet?
Cris.
O‚Äî‚Äî‚Äîbalmy froth‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
Caes.
What's that?
Cris.
‚Äî‚Äî‚ÄîPuffie‚Äî‚Äî‚Äîinflate‚Äî‚Äî‚Äîturgidious‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-ventosity.
Hor.
Balmy, froth, puffie, inflate, turgidous, and ventosity are
come up.
Tib.
O terrible windy words.
Gal.
A sign of a windy brain.
Cris.
O‚Äî‚Äî‚Äîoblatrant‚Äî‚Äî‚Äîfuribund‚Äî‚Äî‚Äîfatuate‚Äî‚Äî‚Äîstrenuous‚Äî-
Hor.
Here's a deal; oblatrant, furibund, fatuate, strenuous.
Caes.
Now all's come up, I trow. What a tumult he had in his belly?
Hor.
No, there's the often conscious damp behind still.
Cris.
O‚Äî‚Äî‚Äîconscious‚Äî‚Äî‚Äîdamp.
Hor.
It is come up, thanks to Apollo and AEsculapius: another; you
were best take a pill more.
Cris.
O, no; O‚Äî‚Äî‚ÄîO‚Äî‚Äî‚ÄîO‚Äî‚Äî‚ÄîO‚Äî‚Äî‚ÄîO!
Hor.
Force yourself then a little with your finger.
Cris.
O‚Äî‚Äî‚ÄîO‚Äî‚Äî‚Äîprorumped.
Tib.
Prorumped I What a noise it made! as if his spirit would have
prorumpt with it.
Cris.
O‚Äî‚Äî‚ÄîO‚Äî‚Äî‚ÄîO!
Virg.
Help him, it sticks strangely, whatever it is.
Cris.
O‚Äî‚Äî‚Äîclutcht
Hor.
Now it is come; clutcht.
Caes.
Clutcht!  it is well that's come up; it had but a narrow
passage.
Cris.
O‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî!
Virg.
Again! hold him, hold his head there.
Cris.
Snarling gusts‚Äî‚Äî‚Äîquaking custard.
Hor.
How now, Crispinus?
Cris.
O‚Äî‚Äî‚Äîobstupefact.
Tib.
Nay, that are all we, I assure you.
Hor.
How do you feel yourself?
Cris.
Pretty and well, I thank you.
Virg.
These pills can but restore him for a time,
Not cure him quite of such a malady,
Caught by so many surfeits, which have fill'd
His blood and brain thus full of crudities:
'Tis necessary therefore he observe
A strict and wholesome diet. Look you take
Each morning of old Cato's principles
A good draught next your heart; that walk upon,
Till it be well digested: then come home,
And taste a piece of Terence, suck his phrase
Instead of liquorice; and, at any hand,
Shun Plautus and old Ennius: they are meats
Too harsh for a weak stomach.
Use to read (But not without a tutor) the best Greeks,
As Orpheus, Musaeus, Pindarus,
Hesiod, Callimachus, and Theocrite,
High Homer; but beware of Lycophron,
He is too dark and dangerous a dish.
You must not hunt for wild outlandish terms,
To stuff out a peculiar dialect;
But let your matter run before your words.
And if at any time you chance to meet
Some Gallo-Belgic phrase; you shall not straight.
Rack your poor verse to give it entertainment,
But let it pass; and do not think yourself
Much damnified, if you do leave it out,
When nor your understanding, nor the sense
Could well receive it. This fair abstinence,
In time, will render you more sound and clear:
And this have I prescribed to you, in place
Of a strict sentence; which till he perform,
Attire him in that robe. And henceforth learn
To bear yourself more humbly; not to swell,
Or breathe your insolent and idle spite
On him whose laughter can your worst affright.
Tib.
Take him away.
Cris.
Jupiter guard Caesar!
Virg.
And for a week or two see him lock'd up
In some dark place, removed from company;
He will talk idly else after his physic.
Now to you, sir.  The extremity of law
Awards you to be branded in the front,
For this your calumny: but since it pleaseth
Horace, the party wrong'd, t' intreat of Caesar
A mitigation of that juster doom,
With Caesar's tongue thus we pronounce your sentence.
Demetrius Fannius, thou shalt here put on
That coat and cap, and henceforth think thyself
No other than they make thee; vow to wear them
In every fair and generous assembly,
Till the best sort of minds shall take to knowledge
As well thy satisfaction, as thy wrongs.
Hor.
Only, grave praetor, here, in open court,
I crave the oath for good behaviour
May be administer'd unto them both.
Virg.
Horace, it shall: Tibullus, give it them.
Tib.
Rufus Laberius Crispinus, and Demetrius Fannius, lay your
hands on your hearts. You shall here solemnly attest and swear,
that never, after this instant, either at booksellers' stalls, in
taverns, two-penny rooms, tyring-houses, noblemen's butteries,
puisents chambers, (the best and farthest places where you are
admitted to come,) you shall once offer or dare (thereby to endear
yourself the more to any player, enghle, or guilty gull in your
company) to malign, traduce, or detract the person or writings of
Quintus Horatius Flaccus, or any other eminent men, transcending
you in merit, whom your envy shall find cause to work upon, either
for that, or for keeping himself in better acquaintance, or
enjoying better friends, or if, transported by any sudden and
desperate resolution, you do, that then you shall not under the
batoon, or in the next presence, being an honourable assembly of
his favourers, be brought as voluntary gentlemen to undertake the
for-swearing of it. Neither shall you, at any time, ambitiously
affecting the title of the Untrussers or Whippers of the age,
suffer the itch of writing to over-run your performance in libel,
upon pain of being taken up for lepers in wit, and, losing both
your time and your papers, be irrecoverably forfeited to the
hospital of fools. So help you our Roman gods and the Genius of
great Caesar.
Virg.
So! now dissolve the court.
Bor. Tib. Gal. Mec.
And thanks to Caesar, That thus hath exercised his patience.
Caes.
We have, indeed, you worthiest friends of Caesar.
It is the bane and torment of our ears,
To hear the discords of those jangling rhymers,
That with their bad and scandalous practices
Bring all true arts and learning in contempt.
But let not your high thoughts descend so low
As these despised objects; let them fall,
With their flat grovelling souls: be you yourselves;
And as with our best favours you stand crown'd,
So let your mutual loves be still renown'd.
Envy will dwell where there is want of merit,
Though the deserving man should crack his spirit.
Blush, folly, blush; here's none that fears
The wagging of an ass's ears,
Although a wolfish case he wears.
Detraction is but baseness' varlet;
And apes are apes, though clothed in scarlet.

Hor.
There are to whom I seem excessive sour,
And past a satire's law t' extend my power:
Others, that think whatever I have writ
Wants pith and matter to eternise it;
And that they could, in one day's light, disclose
A thousand verses, such as I compose.
What shall I do, Trebatius? say.
Treb.
Surcease.
Hor.
And shall my muse admit no more increase?
Treb.
So I advise.
Hor.
An ill death let me die,
If 'twere not best; but sleep avoids mine eye,
And I use these, lest nights should tedious seem.
Treb.
Rather, contend to sleep, and live like them,
That, holding golden sleep in special price,
Rubb'd with sweet oils, swim silver Tyber thrice,
And every even with neat wine steeped be:
Or, if such love of writing ravish thee,
Then dare to sing unconquer'd Caesar's deeds;
Who cheers such actions with abundant meeds.
Hor.
That, father, I desire; but, when I try,
I feel defects in every faculty:
Nor is't a labour fit for every pen,
To paint the horrid troops of armed men,
The lances burst, in Gallia's slaughter'd forces;
Or wounded Parthians, tumbled from their horses:
Great Caesar's wars cannot be fought with words.
Treb.
Yet, what his virtue in his peace affords,
His fortitude and justice thou canst shew
As wise Lucilius honour'd Scipio.
Hor.
Of that, my powers shall suffer no neglect,
When such slight labours may aspire respect:
But, if I watch not a most chosen time,
The humble words of Flaccus cannot climb
Th' attentive ear of Caesar; nor must I
With less observance shun gross flattery:
For he, reposed safe in his own merit,
Spurns back the gloses of a fawning spirit.
Treb.
But how much better would such accents sound
Than with a sad and serious verse to wound
Pantolabus, railing in his saucy jests,
Or Nomentanus spent in riotous feasts?
In satires, each man, though untouch'd, complains
As he were hurt; and hates such biting strains.
Hor.
What shall I do? Milonius shakes his heels
In ceaseless dances, when his brain once feels

ANCHOR
A ‚Äúrace war‚Äù has erupted at one of
the nation‚Äôs oldest and most
prestigious institutions.
Glued to this are our story‚Äôs subjects, who we meet in...
2 A SERIES OF SHOTS 2
TROY FAIRBANKS, 21, Black. He drags a brush through his
finger waves anxiously. The look of guilt is the only mark
of imperfection in his privileged and chiseled demeanor.
ANCHOR (O.S.)
Outrage over an ‚ÄúAfrican American
Themed‚Äù party organized by
predominately white students of
Manchester University has resulted
in rioting and property damages.
2A KURT FLETCHER, 21, white. No sympathy in his jaded blue 2A
eyes as he watches on an iPad in a lavish parlor room.
ANCHOR (O.S.) (CONT‚ÄôD)
Guests were invited to ‚Äúliberate
their inner Negro, fry up chicken,
enjoy a sugar water concoction
known as Purple drank and wear
oversized Barack Obama T-shirts.‚Äù
2B COLANDREA CONNERS (COCO), 20, Black with blue contacts 2B
adjusts the straight bangs of her weave to better see the
small TV in her dorm. A smirk on her glossy pink lips. *
ANCHOR (CONT‚ÄôD)
Officials claim an investigation is
underway to find those responsible
for the event and subsequent riot.
2C SAMANTHA WHITE (SAM) 21, records the broadcast in an 2C
edit bay. Despite her light skin, the Afro pick in her fro
pompadour leaves little doubt she identifies as Black.
ANCHOR (CONT‚ÄôD)
In an effort to address diversity
issues, the school appointed
African American scholar Dr. Walter
Fairbanks as Dean of Students.
2D LIONEL HIGGINS, 20, Black, watches through dark rimmed 2D
glasses in a bustling indifferent Dining Hall. A guilt pains
his otherwise boyish face.
ANCHOR (CONT‚ÄôD)
Last year the Dean‚Äôs office
celebrated slight gains in diverse
applicants but with many now
calling for Fairbanks' resignation,
that may have been pre-mature.
2E DEAN WALTER FAIRBANKS, a well adorned Black man in his 2E
50‚Äôs fights a panic as he watches in a stately office.

As Lionel gets to the door of a large Colonial style home he
checks his pockets. He‚Äôs missing something. Shit.
LIONEL
(knocking)
Kurt! You home?
Lionel dials on his cell and we hear the PHONE RING from
inside. Voicemail pops on with a voice other than Lionel‚Äôs.

The beep sounds. Lionel‚Äôs in shock. Should he hang up? Or...
LIONEL
Kurt. It‚Äôs Lionel. I‚Äôm locked out.
As Lionel slides down the length of the door into a sit he
unfolds the flyer he was just handed. It‚Äôs a rendering of Sam
White on a carton of milk with the caption:

11 INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY 11
Colandrea Conners (Coco) trains her unnaturally blue eyes
right at us from a Youtube page pulled up on an iPad. She‚Äôs
got an entitled air about her. Even her cusses sound erudite.
COCO (YOUTUBE)
...I am! The whole point of
randomized housing is to mix shit
up. I‚Äôm out here trying to find the
Olivier to my Halle Berry, and
they‚Äôve got me looking like an
extra on a Different World...
The video ends with a click. Looking up is HELMUT WEST, a
30‚Äôs something Black man in dark rimmed glasses and trendy
everything. Too stylish for this place. If he‚Äôs impressed,
it‚Äôs barely perceptible.
HELMUT

HELMUT
Thanks so much for coming in.
Coco gets up to leave. Tries to recover.
COCO
So what‚Äôs this show about anyway?
HELMUT
Here‚Äôs the way reality works
sweetheart, I‚Äôm the producer. I ask
the questions. Be in touch.
And with that Helmut hustles Coco out. He sits and ponders
before unmuting his iPad.
SAM (O.S.)
Dear White People I am here to
burst your post-racial little
bubble.

Yes Oprah may have her own network,
but Ann Coulter is still writing
best sellers, Black kids are still

Fletcher.
Helmut double checks his app fighting a genuine grin.
HELMUT
This is the school radio?
13 INT. ARMSTRONG / PARKER HALL - DAY 13
A pristine pair of Retro Jordans make their way through the
halls of Armstrong / Parker where Black students have lively
debates, flirt and bump the student radio.
SAM (O.S.)
Dear White People, thanks to the

you may be jarred by an assignment
to Armstrong/Parker house.
The owner of the Jordans is revealed as Troy Fairbanks.
TROY

TROY (CONT‚ÄôD)
Newbies right?
The white sophomores nod their heads yes.
TROY (CONT‚ÄôD)
Welcome to Armstrong / Parker, home
of the dopest dining hall in all of
Manchester. I‚Äôm Troy, Head of

SOPHOMORE

like ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs up‚Äù and ‚Äúmy brotha‚Äù
That‚Äôs not how you normally talk.
TROY
Ya‚Äôll take care. Nice Jordan‚Äôs bro.
Coco and SOFIA FLETCHER, a dewy-eyed, pink lipped brunette
who exudes a kind of sexy boredom saunter down the halls.
SOFIA
Your hair is so cute B. T. Dubs.
COCO
You‚Äôre so cute.
SOFIA
Is it weaved?
Coco‚Äôs face is a battle between fury and polite surprise.
SOFIA (CONT‚ÄôD)
I saw ‚ÄúGood Hair‚Äù in Afro studies.
COCO

Hey what house did you get?
SOFIA
Huh? Oh Bechet bitch.
COCO
Of course. The mere thought of a

SOFIA
Easy, it was the luck of the draw.
Daddy had nothing to do with it.
Coco rolls her eyes behind a smile.
SOFIA (CONT‚ÄôD)
And honestly, if I had to pick
anywhere to be it‚Äôd be here.
Sofia eyes the delicious morsels of chocolate boys about.
COCO
I‚Äôm down to switch if you are. You
get your Denzel. I get my Gosling.
8.
SOFIA
Oh I got mines. Want to meet him?
They turn the corner to spot Troy greeting more new
Sophomores. Coco‚Äôs caught off guard by his looks.
COCO
Cute...

glance)
...for a Black boy.
Troy sees Sofia and flashes his trademark grin. They kiss.
SOFIA
Hey boo. This is my friend Coco.
She‚Äôs new to the house.
TROY
Hey I‚Äôm Troy. Welcome to Armstrong

SOFIA
-- Are we on duty?
TROY
Head of House is always on duty.
COCO
Nice to meet you. I should get
settled. Thanks Sof!
Sofia and Troy smile as Coco turns to go - and continue down
the hallway. Coco sneaks one last glance at Troy‚Äôs ass.
TROY
Think I got time for a quick cut?
SOFIA
You got it cut last week.
TROY
It‚Äôs a Black thing babe.
SOFIA
Since when is OCD a Black thang?
TROY
Don‚Äôt say ‚Äúthang‚Äù like that.
SOFIA
Besides you‚Äôve got a shift at the

TROY

SOFIA
Then a movie maybe? Just us?

Sofia holds her tongue. Troy ignores this as he spots...
TROY (CONT‚ÄôD)
Yo, Kurt my man.
14 DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 14
...Kurt Fletcher - flanked by guys who share his cynical
knowing glare. We recognize them from the ‚ÄúPastiche‚Äù portrait
from before.
As they chow down on Mac & Cheese in the Dining Hall - Kurt‚Äôs
glare burns particularly hot towards Troy who waves at him.
KURT

Sofia smiles at her brother Kurt. Troy covers the sting of
his dismissal.
They both spot Sam‚Äôs ‚ÄúMissing: Black culture‚Äù flyers.
TROY
Is she kidding with this?
SOFIA
You don‚Äôt have to run again. Just
because it‚Äôs her doesn‚Äôt mean --
TROY
-- I can‚Äôt let Sam and her wannabe
Black Panthers take the House. The
House needs me. This is who I am.

Troy smiles over his irritation. This is an old fight.
TROY
Oh so you pick up a Psych class you

SOFIA
A Freud reference. Sophisticated.

Fine Beck, Jung, Maslow...
Troy gets a kiss out of her as they pass a booth featuring
stacks of Sam‚Äôs ‚ÄúEBONY & IVY.‚Äù The booth is manned by REGGIE,
21, Black - his fro top and preppy punk attire is both
bohemian and radical.
Troy glares at Sam‚Äôs picture on the book. It‚Äôs on. There‚Äôs a
history between Sam and Troy. Off Reggie‚Äôs laptop we hear...
SAM (O.S.)
Dear White People, this just in.
Dating a Black person to piss off
your parents is a form of racism.
Sofia walks off as Troy hears snickers from around him.
REGGIE
Yo Troy I forget. Is your major in
shucking or was it jiving?
TROY
My major‚Äôs in Jive. Minoring in
Shuck. You‚Äôre still majoring in
trying to fuck my left overs right?
Troy walks off as Reggie and Kurt watch him join Sofia.
SOFIA
You need a shower.
15 INT. TROY‚ÄôS BATHROOM - DAY 15
Water runs while Troy takes a hit of weed from a pipe over
the toilet. He blows the smoke out an open window through a
paper towel tube with a dryer sheet attached to its end. He
jots something down on a notepad as he whispers...
TROY
You went from ODB to Trey Songz...
16 INT. ARMSTRONG/PARKER DINING HALL - NIGHT 16
The hall is packed with STUDENTS - stylish and mostly Black.
Helmut West watches from the back.
TROY
Artie, you know your success ratio

11.
The audience is in STITCHES at this last line. Everyone
except Sam, Reggie and their crew of afro‚Äôd bohemian
disciples (who we‚Äôll call the BOFROS). Sam records the
proceedings with a vintage Super 8 camera.
REGGIE
That‚Äôs his platform? Haircuts?
SAM
Oofta is as Oofta does.
Coco, sneaks through the door. She‚Äôs got the eyes of Helmut

Coco wafts her silky hair over her shoulders and sits.
TROY
No but seriously, I care about you
guys. I care about this house. We
had a great year last year and if
it ain‚Äôt broke...
Troy basks in his applause. Coco eats him up with her eyes.
Sam doesn‚Äôt want to get up - her breathing gets heavier.
REGGIE
Just pretend like you‚Äôre in the
booth. Just you and the mic.
SAM
Hate this shit.
As Sam gets up and passes Troy --
TROY
You really think you can take this

SAM
Troy we live in a world where
there‚Äôs a Big Momma‚Äôs House 3. I

God.
12.
Sam grabs the mic. Her voice shakes before the silent crowd.
SAM (CONT‚ÄôD)
Troy my brother, it‚Äôs broke.
The BoFros cheer and make noise on each line.
SAM (CONT‚ÄôD)
Troy‚Äôs a legacy kid. And yet it‚Äôs
under his watch that Armstrong /
Parker, the bastion of Black
culture here was gutted. By the
Randomization of Housing Act.
Second years of color no longer
have a say in where they go. The
culture that‚Äôs been fostered in
this house for two decades will be
wiped out in two years.
Troy looks to see if the speech is working. As Sam warms up --
SAM (CONT‚ÄôD)
This wasn‚Äôt motivated by a desire
to mix things up. Bring about
racial and socioeconomic harmony.
No, the Black kids are sitting
together in the proverbial
cafeteria and they must be up to no
good.
Coco‚Äôs eyes are in the back of her head.
SAM (CONT‚ÄôD)
We sit together to protect
ourselves. Over a century of houses
grouped by sports affiliations,
political leanings, majors, you
name it. Black folks get their own
house, suddenly we got a problem?
Students look at each other stunned. Are they turning? Sam
delivers the next one directly at Sofia and Troy.
SAM (CONT‚ÄôD)
This Act doesn‚Äôt affect the other
houses like it does ours. There are
plenty of trustees, former coaches,
and presidents watching out for the
others. All we have is a Dean who‚Äôd
rather please his massa --
TROY
-- Yo that‚Äôs enough of that Sam --
13.
SAM
-- then stand up for his own. Look,
I know ya‚Äôll ain‚Äôt voting for me.
Ya‚Äôll ain‚Äôt ready and I didn‚Äôt come
here for that. The Black Student
Union and I have brought a petition
to repeal the Randomization of
Housing Act. I plan on bringing it
to the President and together we
can bring Black back to Manchester.
It‚Äôll be by the door.
Sam sits as claps trickle from the crowd. The BoFros go crazy
- give her daps and all sorts of praise.
MARTIN, 20, a gentle erudite giant of a football player with
neat braids tucked under a Fedora raises a hand.
MARTIN
I assume everyone has the app I
created by now?
REGGIE
(aside)
It‚Äôs a child‚Äôs app...
MARTIN
Good. Voting may commence.
Everyone takes out smart phones. Reggie hides his from view
as he punches something in.
Troy spots the white Sophomores he greeted from before who
give him a head nod. Troy‚Äôs got this. After a moment...
MARTIN (CONT‚ÄôD)
Okay. Looks like we‚Äôve got
ourselves a winner.
(devastated)
Sam White?
The blood drains from Sam‚Äôs face and Troy‚Äôs smile plummets
into the floor as the two turn to look at each other.
TROY & SAM
Oh shit.
Reggie‚Äôs grin is from ear to ear as Helmut walks over and
slips a card to a still stunned Sam. Coco watches him go.
17 INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT 17
Right on the heels of Helmut‚Äôs exit is...
14.
COCO
So that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre looking for?
HELMUT
I‚Äôm looking for good TV sister.
COCO
I think I‚Äôd be good TV.
HELMUT
You‚Äôre at a great school, getting a
great education. Be good at that.
COCO
I am. And when I graduate early
with an Economics degree from
Manchester it will be the crowning
achievement of my Black middle
class parents‚Äô ambitions.
HELMUT
Conflict is a commodity in my
industry. Sam‚Äôs got it. Do you?
COCO
So you want me to start a fight.
HELMUT
(exactly)
I don‚Äôt want you to do anything you
wouldn‚Äôt otherwise do.
Helmut hands her his card. A fire sparks in Coco as he exits.
He contemplates her. Fights a growing smile.
18 INT. DEAN‚ÄôS OFFICE - DAY 18
A fireplace rages behind Lionel who stares at the floor while
the message plays over speaker phone.
SPEAKER

What about Armstrong / Parker?
15.
LIONEL

DEAN FAIRBANKS
I might have an opening. Maybe it‚Äôd

Maybe it‚Äôs in your head. Sure,
sometimes our folks can be
intolerant around people like you.
Homo --
LIONEL
-- I don‚Äôt believe in labels.
Fairbanks just smiles. This is a sore spot and he backs off.
Lionel glares up at a poster above Fairbank‚Äôs desk: Students
of all races on the steps of Ellington Library including Troy
with the phrase ‚ÄúMANCHESTER: WHERE YOU BELONG‚Äù printed below.
Troy‚Äôs huge smile seems to mock him.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
You like jazz Lionel? Manchester‚Äôs
like jazz you know.
LIONEL
This is a research school.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
And jazz is tension. The interplay
of improvised solos all creating
one song. Your problem is you‚Äôve
got no instrument. No major, no
affiliations, no solo son.
LIONEL
I submit articles to the
Independent Observer.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
No one reads the Independent
Observer, my point is are you
playing swing or bebop?
LIONEL
You‚Äôre mixing metaphors.
16.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
Are you a sax or are you a trumpet?
LIONEL
I hate jazz.
Fairbanks checks his watch. All out of ideas.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
I‚Äôll do what I can. Not a word of
this in the Observer okay?
LIONEL
What‚Äôs it matter? No one reads it.
19 EXT. MANCHESTER - DAY 19
Lionel walks alone through the buzzing campus. He looks out
to..
...a group of BLACK KIDS. He sees a version of himself
amongst them - his hair a finger waved Ceasar fade, as he
trades ‚ÄúNo Homo‚Äôs‚Äù with the others.
Lionel shakes it off. Peers over to a group of out and proud
gay kids and sees a version of himself amongst them - his
hair straightened and coifed in a fitted shirt laughing.
Not right either. Where does he fit? By surprise...
GEORGE
Lionel right?
GEORGE PIERCE, 24, an intellectual whose tattooed quotes from
Nietzsche peek out seductively from under his button up.
GEORGE (CONT‚ÄôD)
George. We had Civ last semester?
How you doing?
LIONEL
Grood...Gate...I‚Äôm ah..
GEORGE
Fan of your stuff. In the Observer?
LIONEL
No one reads the Observer.
GEORGE
You seen this?
George hands Lionel Sam‚Äôs ‚ÄúMissing Black Culture‚Äù flyer.
17.
GEORGE (CONT‚ÄôD)
The residents of Armstrong / Parker
just made her head of house. Am I
crazy or is there a there there?
LIONEL
What made you come over here?
George holds up Sam‚Äôs ‚ÄúEbony & Ivy.‚Äù Lionel takes it.
LIONEL (CONT‚ÄôD)
I mean I‚Äôm glad you came --
GEORGE
-- My staff? God bless them.
They‚Äôre whiter than Michael
Jackson‚Äôs kids. We‚Äôre fucked if
anyone of them writes this story
and I will not let the transfers at
the Gazette do it first.
LIONEL
The oldest one has his face.
GEORGE
You‚Äôre in the Black Student Union.
You probably know Sam.
Lionel shakes his head ‚Äúyes‚Äù and ‚Äúno‚Äù at the same time.
GEORGE (CONT‚ÄôD)
You come up with a good angle? I
want it in the Bugle.
Lionel eyes the bold ‚ÄúBugle‚Äù logo on George‚Äôs shirt.
LIONEL
(aside)
Trumpet...
GEORGE
Bugle. Focus. The only paper on
campus with a national subscription
base and an Advisor from the New
York Times? Only so many ways a
person can distinguish themselves
at a place like this Lionel. You‚Äôre
good. You belong with us.
The way Lionel fights the smile creeping up his face - we
know he‚Äôs never heard these words. Never belonged any place.
Doesn‚Äôt hurt there‚Äôs a handsome boy smiling at him either.
18.
20 INT. ARMSTRONG/PARKER DINING HALL - DAY 20
Troy and Sam sit across from each other at a table. Their
opposite facing laptops and a world of tension put a wall
between them.
TROY
Get it yet?
Sam shakes her head yes.
TROY (CONT‚ÄôD)
Good. You‚Äôve now got the shared
calendar, contacts, and official
email.
Troy throws a smirk her way before pulling out a thick stack
of papers.
TROY (CONT‚ÄôD)
Oh and before I forget.
SAM
Event requests for the year?
TROY
Just this month. They need your
approval. Also don‚Äôt forget to pick
your office hours. At least 20 per
week.
SAM
That‚Äôs absurd.
TROY
You‚Äôre in charge of a hundred
residents now. And they need time
to complain to your face. About
noise. Leaky pipes. Gluten free
options in the cafeteria. Etcetera.
SAM
Troy. I didn‚Äôt think I was going to
win.
TROY
And by the way petitioning the
President on the Randomization of
Housing Act isn‚Äôt gonna do shit.
None of the other houses are
concerned.
19.
SAM
Because they all have a legacy of
rich and powerful allies on the
board who will make sure that
‚Äúrandom‚Äù works out to their
advantage.
TROY
And you think a petition is going
to change that?
Troy gets up to leave as Reggie sits - suspicious. Sam‚Äôs
phone buzzes: ‚ÄúMOM.‚Äù The letters chill Sam to the core.
21 INT. ARMSTRONG / PARKER - DAY 21
Lionel steps his way through the hall, a deer in headlights
with a notepad. He flips through Sam‚Äôs ‚ÄúEBONY & IVY‚Äù book...
SAM (V.O.)
The Armstrong / Parker dining hall
is the epicenter of Black culture
as it stands at Manchester. Only
here can you commiserate, celebrate
and discuss everything from Kanye
West lyrics to theoretical
relativism all in one sitting. Not
to mention find someone who can
actually do your hair.
ARMSTRONG / PARKER DINING HALL - CONTINUOUS
Lionel enters and takes a place in a line. He absorbs this
lively and somewhat alien dining hall.
Troy now holds court near the windows at a table of eight or
so friends including Martin and SUNGMI, a lip ringed Korean
art major.
MARTIN
‚ÄúWe wuz robbed.‚Äù That election was
suspect man.
Martin glares at Reggie and his giant souped-up Laptop. Sam
breaks this by sitting back down - her phone call ending.
SAM
You call me the minute there‚Äôs an
update. Love you too mom.
Sam hangs up. The call‚Äôs really put her in a bad place. She
sits at a table of her Bofros - who we‚Äôll name by their hair.
20.
CURLS
There is one other sister in my
Relativity class, I‚Äôll be damned if
our professor doesn‚Äôt call me
Laretta every God damn time.
DREADS
We all look the same.
REGGIE
Programming professor gets me and
Martin here mixed up constantly.
MARTIN
You should be so lucky.
Reggie glances over at Martin‚Äôs Mac Air.
REGGIE
Cute. You get that at Toys R Us?
Sam pulls out her Mac and her student ID card.
REGGIE (CONT‚ÄôD)
You still using your ID number?
SAM
I always forget passwords.
REGGIE
You are begging to get hacked.
SAM
Good thing the one evil technogenius
thinking like that is on my
side.
Sam pushes aside all the paperwork on her table.
SAM (CONT‚ÄôD)
So this is what the revolution
looks like? Office hours and
paperwork.
Sam pulls her camera out - starts to shoot the room.
REGGIE
Winning was a happy accident. We
want the reform repealed right?
CURLS
Means to an end, sister.
21.
Sam feels the heat of her disciples‚Äô eyes on her as the topic
of the day rages on with the entrance of Coco, who sits with
a group of well manicured hot-ironed group of girls, white
and Black.
COCO
The talented tenth always has to
bust its ass a little bit harder,
but I don‚Äôt see the benefit in
blaming white folks for everything.
CURLS
Who‚Äôs blaming?
TROY
I don‚Äôt see the issue. I never had
one. Never ran into any lynch mobs.
Lionel takes a seat alone facing the action.
Kurt and crew enter with plates of mac and cheese and sit in
the heart of the conversation. Lionel avoids eye contact.
SAM
Lynch mob is still there. Just rebranded
itself.
TROY
As what pray tell?
REGGIE
The Republican party.
SAM
Want to know how this world sees
you? Go to a Young Republican‚Äôs
meeting and bring up Welfare.
SUNGMI
Or Immigration.
LIONEL
(aside)
Or gay equality.
KURT
Bullshit.
MARTIN
I agree. Got something to add?
KURT
The biggest athletes, movie stars,
hell your president is Black.
22.
(MORE)
Sometimes I think the hardest thing
to be in the American work force
right now is an educated white guy.
SUNGMI
You‚Äôre not serious.
KURT
You guys still got affirmative
action, you‚Äôre set.
REGGIE
This shit.
SAM
What are you doing in here?
KURT
Obama. Leader of the free world got
into Harvard on affirmative action.
Know who‚Äôs not president right now?
The guy that didn‚Äôt get in.
SAM
On behalf of the colored folks in
the room, let me apologize for all
the better qualified white students
whose place we‚Äôre taking up.
Kurt chuckles - a bit turned on by the argument.
SAM (CONT‚ÄôD)
You get lost? Bechet is that way.
KURT
Yeah but what other dining hall
gives you chicken and waffles? Dear
White People right? Funny stuff.
How haven‚Äôt we staffed you yet?
SAM
On Pastiche? Your uninspired humor
magazine?
KURT
We‚Äôre a lot more than a magazine
sweetie. SNL staff is basically
half Lampoon, half Pastiche. Just
like the network comedies.
A flash of envy comes over Troy and Coco.
23.
KURT (CONT'D)
SAM
What gives you Clubhouse kids the
right to come to our Dining Hall?
Kurt eats an exaggerated scoop of mac and cheese.
SAM (CONT‚ÄôD)
You don‚Äôt live here.
MARTIN
Sam? What are you doing?
SAM
You can‚Äôt eat here.
Kurt eyes this new adversary. Enjoys a good challenge.
TROY
Chill Sam damn. Let the man--
KURT & SAM
-- I got this.
KURT
Who are you to put me out?
SAM
(realizing)
I‚Äôm the Head of this house. And I‚Äôm
doing things my way.
Sam shoots this last one to Martin. Kurt rolls his eyes to
which Sam slams his tray to the ground.
Lionel scribbles down notes furiously on a notepad.
KURT
You got any idea who you‚Äôre --
SAM
-- Yeah, I know who your daddy is.
The same one who‚Äôs been pushing to
break up this House for a decade.
What‚Äôs wrong? Is he scared letting
the Negroes gather in groups might
start a rebellion on the
plantation? You tell him from
me...he should be.
Kurt looks into Sam‚Äôs eyes and then his crew. They want out.
KURT
Bad move.
24.
Kurt leads his crew out of the dining hall drawing a slight
snicker from Lionel which draws Sam‚Äôs eyes right to him.
Something sparks in Lionel. He takes out his phone and texts
to GEORGE: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got the angle. I‚Äôm in.‚Äù
SAM
You too.
LIONEL
Me?
SAM
Is this your house?
Lionel sinks - the eyes of everyone in the room on him.
Sam sits back down as a trickle of claps grow to a steady
applause. Troy and his table look around baffled.
By the caution on Sam‚Äôs face it seems the first time she‚Äôs
ever heard this sound directed at her.
A slight envy boils in Coco.
One last look to the room from Lionel before he slips out.
Locked out again.
23 INT. COCO‚ÄôS ROOM - DAY 23
Coco scrolls Sam‚Äôs ‚ÄúDear White People‚Äù Youtube page. 75K
Subscribers. She presses play on the latest video.
SAM (O.S.)
Dear White People, stop dancing.
Two seconds. 600K views.
COCO
The fuck?
Coco exits and opens her own ‚ÄúTIME AT AN IVY LEAGUE‚Äù page. 2K
subscribers. Her latest video is at 10K views. Alright... She
presses record. Let‚Äôs the camera rest on her briefly...
COCO (CONT‚ÄôD)
Muffins. I hate to do it, but Imma
have to get real Black with you.
(comes to mind)
So the other day, a girl had the
nerve to fix her mouth and ask me
if my hair was weaved.
(after a moment)
Weaved. Weaved bitch?
25.
(MORE)
First of all if you‚Äôre going to fix
your mouth to ask me something like
that, say it right please? It‚Äôs
weave. Noun. Present tense. Second
of all don‚Äôt assume just because
you see a sister with some hair
it‚Äôs a weave. Is it? Clearly. If a
bitch could grow straight Indian
hair directly out her own head I
wouldn‚Äôt have just overdrafted my
account paying for this shit but
that ain‚Äôt your business. Are those
your lips sweetie? Sweet heart is
that really your skin? These white
girls and these tans I swear to
God, they‚Äôre starting to look
darker than me.
Coco pauses it. Her mouse hovers over the check box next to
‚Äúprivate.‚Äù Instead she plays it back...and hits ‚Äúpublish.‚Äù
She clicks back through to Sam‚Äôs last video and hits ‚Äúreply.‚Äù
As the red light on her computer‚Äôs web cam turns green...
COCO (CONT‚ÄôD)
Dear White People. What do I think
about it?
24 INT. SCREENING ROOM - DAY 24
Sam with arms folded watches as Gabe (Sam‚Äôs caller from
earlier) presses play on a DVD. Horrified students watch...
...a Black and white 1920‚Äôs style silent movie, complete with
Dialogue Cards and dramatic PIANO MUSIC.
SERIES OF SHOTS - ON THE SCREEN
A) OBAMA speaks at a debate
B) DIALOGUE CARD: ‚ÄúWe are the change that we seek.‚Äù
C) A FAMILY in white-face go ape-shit
D) DIALOGUE CARD: ‚ÄúHE‚ÄôS READING OFF A TELEPROMPTER!!!!!!‚Äù
E) More intercut footage of Obama speaking with actors in
white-face reacting. Until...
F) DIALOGUE CARD: OBAMA WINS A SECOND TERM!
G) A WHITE-FACE CROWD goes nuts in the streets - scream into
camera - loot buildings and shoot themselves in the head.
26.
COCO (CONT‚ÄôD)
H) Dialogue Card: ‚ÄúFIN‚Äù
PROFESSOR BODKIN, late 40s, with a ‚Äúseen it all before‚Äù
demeanor hides a grin and lets the room settle.
PROFESSOR BODKIN
Okay. Does anyone have any comments
for Sam‚Äôs ‚ÄúRebirth of a Nation?‚Äù
All of the kids are too scared to comment. Except...
PROFESSOR BODKIN (CONT‚ÄôD)
Gabe, go ahead.
GABE
I dig the ‚Äúsilent movie‚Äù thing, but
it‚Äôs a little self-congratulatory.
Light on story and frankly
thematically dubious.
PROFESSOR BODKIN
Okay. Anybody else?
SAM
What?
SAME PLACE - MOMENTS LATER
As students filter out of the class...
PROFESSOR BODKIN
Sam?
SAM
Before you say anything might I
remind you that I sat through Birth
of A Nation, Gone With The Wind,
and Tarantino week without protest.
PROFESSOR BODKIN
And might I remind you that I read
all fifteen pages of your
unsolicited essay on why Gremlins
is actually about suburban white
fear of Black culture.
SAM
The Gremlins are loud, talk in
slang, are addicted to fried
chicken and freak out when you get
their hair wet.
27.
PRESIDENT BODKIN
My only problem with your movie is
that it was late. The silent
projects were last semester Sam.
You were supposed to have emailed
your sound treatment over Summer.
SAM
I‚Äôve been getting footage.
PROFESSOR BODKIN
This is your senior thesis Sam,
where the hell is your head at?
SAM
I‚Äôve got Radio, BSU, this Head of
House thing --
PROFESSOR BODKIN
-- Do you want this? Cause if not,
don‚Äôt waste my time here --
Sam pulls out the Super 8 camera from her satchel.
SAM
-- Look this thing might as well be
my right hand Professor. I was busy
this summer that‚Äôs all.
PROFESSOR BODKIN
With everything but your major?
While your peers are taking
internships, making short films...
SAM
My dad. He‚Äôs sick. Had to go home.
PROFESSOR BODKIN
If you need some time off, take it.
But if you want to make ",en,LABEL_0,0.5221949219703674,LABEL_1,0.47780510783195496

""Dear My Friend"" was something I didn't expect from Agust D. I wasn't much active on Genius to help out with the song but I remember listening to it and the tone with the piano was just amazing. The more ballad-like tone really made me love it even more! When I went to the English Translation while listening to it and immediately teared up. I loved the song since due to the whole pandemic I wasn't able to see a good friend of mine and I feel that we maybe have drifted apart. Especially the line that parallels ""Spring Day,"" that goes like,
""Was it you who changed? Or was it me? Uh
I hate this flowing time, it's us who changed""
I can relate to Agust D and that line in particular as I've seen many who were good friends turn on each other and went separate ways. They just move on. To them, life goes on. For Agust D to have put this as the ending for D-2 just showcases the lyrical genius he is. Hopefully, if this pandemic ends, I can chat with my friend and catch up.
- Hobschiske""Îç§ÎçîÎüº (Dumhdurum)"" - ApinkOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
The veteran Kpop girl group, Apink reinvented their style in 2018 and have since released some of the most sophisticated songs in Kpop. The song was produced by the legendary producer, Black Eyed Pilseung, the duo behind several Kpop hits. With ‚ÄúÎç§ÎçîÎüº (Dumhdurum)‚Äù, the ladies of Apink showed a maturer side of love and heartbreak not only through their lyrics but also their sound. With the song, Apink tackles the stereotypes of ageism in the entertainment industry. The song became their 4th Top 10 hit on the Billboard World Digital Songs chart. Apink is living proof that it is possible for K-Pop idols to evolve and age gracefully with their fans. They have managed to retain their fans who came to love them in 2011 and have gained new fans in today's industry. My only wish is for Apink to have more than one comeback each year.
- ssaa10dec""God's Menu"" - Stray KidsOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
Most will remember this track as ‚Äúthat cooking song,‚Äù but this intense and addictive track is a good preview of what Stray Kids have to offer. ‚ÄúÁ•ûÎ©îÎâ¥ (God's Menu)‚Äù is full of cooking metaphors that represent Stray Kids' uniqueness and their resistance of fitting into the mold crafted by the K-Pop industry. Furthermore, the song highlights Stray Kids' strengths beautifully. The group's producing unit, 3RACHA, brought the track to life: making sure to keep Stray Kids' signature flair while also implementing unfamiliar but addictive sounds. Moreover, the group uniquely showed off their all-roundedness, with members that rapped, sang, and even some that did both. Felix's captivating voice was utilized really well throughout the track, turning heads whenever his parts came up. This song may only be a taste of what Stray Kids have to offer, but I believe its many elements perfectly summarizes their abilities.
- PlanNine16""Stay Tonight"" - Chung HaOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
'Stay Tonight' has all the features one could expect from a Chung Ha single: sultry vocals, a strong build-up to the chorus, and overall dynamic production allowing impressive dance performances showcasing her talent. But what really sets the song apart from her other singles, and as one of the most striking songs of the year, are its atmospheric, mysterious vibe; its 90's influences and incorporation of harps and piano; and her vocal delivery, both seductive and impressive (those high notes right before the choruses and bridge!). As a whole, it sounds very unique and does a great job creating hype for her first full album.
- ab212""ÏóêÏûá (eight)"" - IU (ft. SUGA)Original Song | Romanization | English Translation
Korean songstress, IU joined forces with BTS member Suga to release an uplifting anthem for turning 28 years old. This song was obviously going to be extremely popular not just in Korea but also internationally. But after hearing the song and reading its lyrics, I was happy that it gained all the popularity. The two artists aged 28, sang about the challenges of being a certain age in the music industry but also the joys of being an adult. It was also really nice to hear that the song might have been dedicated to IU's friends, Goo Hara and Jonghyun. The song followed IU‚Äôs age-themed hits like 2015‚Äôs ‚ÄúÏä§Î¨ºÏÖã (Twenty-three)‚Äù and 2017‚Äôs ‚ÄúPalette‚Äù. Each song including ‚ÄúEight‚Äù is written as a self-reflection of her year. Combining the popularity of the two singers, the song debuted at #1 on both South Korean charts and the Billboard World Digital Songs chart.
- ssaa10dec""Ghosting"" - TOMORROW X TOGETHEROriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
From the first seconds, I knew this song was going to be great. My breath was taken. ""Ghosting"" has a very dreamy sound, it reminds me of tracks like G-Dragon's ""CROOKED"" or Emarosa's ""IW2WY"". I don't know a lot of Korean, but all the angsty feelings were expressed very clearly throughout the vocal and instrumental melodies. Once I looked up the lyrics, I think it's easily relatable to anyone. The story is told through a lot of metaphors and references to social media. While I normally find the latter kind of cringy, I'm a sucker for metaphors, and also‚Ä¶ that's just life. We exist in the digital era, a lot of quarrels happen online and it's part of how our world works nowadays. People are meant to come and go in our lives, they're only here to stay in our memories.
- EleventhCassette""Kick It"" - NCT 127Original Song | Romanization | English Translation
Something I enjoy about NCT 127 is how experimental their music is, though they always maintain the group's signature sound. ""Kick It"" is one of the few songs I liked from the moment I first listened to it and it can rightfully be described as experimental; starting from the chorus, which is memorable and catchy, to the rap verses that are energetic enough to get you excited, I had no problem letting myself get lost within the pulsating bass and synth. The powerful song is balanced out with the bridge, which allows you to slow down for a bit while enjoying the melodious voices of the main vocalists. Finally, there is a well-executed high note followed by a breakdown that is showcased through an amazing choreography. The impact ""Kick It"" has had not only on the Korean netizens but also on the international crowd is most definitely expected, considering this song was meant for greatness. In my opinion, this track is an anthem and it marks a before and after in the group‚Äôs career.
- loveholic""Black Swan"" - BTSOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
This blend of R&B, trap, and classical music can seem strange at the first sight but works beautifully. The meaning of the song can be summed up with a paraphrase of the quote from Martha Graham‚Äîthe artists die twice, the first time when they stop doing what they love. The lyrics are very personal and introspective, BTS wrote about the fear of growing distant from their passion for music after being on the stage for more so many years (the group debuted in 2013). This song is definitely timeless. Talking about ""Black Swan"" it's hard to not mention the Orchestral version, that was released with accompany of the art film and is played only during live performances, but definitely should be released officially!
- siannve""Î≥¥ÎùºÎπõ Î∞§ (Pporappippam)"" - SunmiOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
Sunmi has established herself as a reputable and successful soloist in the K-Pop industry. With ""Pporappippam"", Sunmi brought a much-needed breath of freshness to 2020's K-Pop sound. While her tracks, ""Í∞ÄÏãúÎÇò (Gashina)"" and ""ÏÇ¨Ïù¥Î†å (Siren)"" were viral hits and personal favorites of mine, ""Pporappippam"" presented Sunmi's truest self as a performer. It had the nostalgic sound of Wonder Girls discography but still felt modern. With the song's lyrics and visuals, Sunmi painted the imagery contrasting reality and dream. The duality of the song can also be seen in Sunmi's overall persona evident in the wardrobe choices, choreography, and even color scheme for the era. Sunmi has continued to stand-out with her music and performance and she makes it work every single time.
- ssaa10dec""Lovesick Girls"" - BLACKPINKOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
I‚Äôve been enjoying BLACKPINK‚Äôs B-side tracks more than their promotional singles for a while now, from ‚ÄúForever Young‚Äù to ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt know what to do.‚Äù Although ‚ÄúLovesick Girls‚Äù is the third single off of THE ALBUM, it gives me a similar vibe as other B-sides: nothing grand, magnificent, or badass; the girls are having a good time, and it doesn't feel like making a hit was the only thing on Teddy‚Äôs mind when he co-wrote the song. The song takes me back to the early 2010s and the resemblance between ‚ÄúLovesick Girls‚Äù and songs like ‚ÄúAll Night‚Äù and ‚ÄúWake Me Up‚Äù is just uncanny. The contrast between black and pink has appeared in BLACKPINK‚Äôs music videos numerous times in the past, but when Ros√© pours the black paint on the pink wall, it has since become my favorite black-pink-contrast moment ever.
- peaker""Ïö± (UGH!)"" - BTSOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
This B-side from Map of The Soul: 7 somehow fits into 2020 perfectly. Performed by BTS' rap line (RM, SUGA and j-hope), the song discusses sudden and strong anger, but not necessarily as a negative emotion, as it can be used to fuel important changes, no matter if in person‚Äôs life or globally. The Korean word Ïö± (ugh) can means so much depending upon the context, and as the group said it ""includes all of the life's up and downs."" The song can feel almost cathartic‚ÄîAngry? Play ""UGH!"" Frustrated? Play ""UGH!"" Need a boost? Play ""UGH!""
- siannve""Ïù¥Îç∞ÏïÑ (IDEA:ÁêÜÊÉ≥)"" - TaeminOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
""Criminal"" vs. ""IDEA"" is an impossible choice because well Taemin only puts out iconic songs. But the reason I finally went with ""IDEA"" because it really reminded me of his old songs like, ""Í¥¥ÎèÑ (Danger)"" and ""Drip Drop"". The performance-centric songs where Taemin truly shines. The whole concept of aiming for perfection is something only Taemin can do. The concept is intertwined in the song's music video, choreography but also in its lyrics i.e. ""You are my messiah"". Also, nobody can pull off a magenta-colored velvet jacket besides Taemin. BoA's haunting ""Killing Me Softly"" adds to the menacing vibe of the song. I have said this before and I'll say it again, Taemin can do no wrong in my book.
- ssaa10dec""Misfit"" - NCT UOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
There is no better way to introduce a project as big as NCT 2020 than with an addictive 90's themed cypher that features the group's rap line. It is no surprise the group would make a notorious and hefty entrance to let everybody know that NCTzen's most awaited event of the year is on its way. Featuring NCT 127's Mark, Taeyong and Johnny, NCT DREAM's Jeno, WayV's Yangyang and Hendery and NCT U's newest member Sungchan, this song is an explosion of power and energy with a punchy melody that would make anybody go crazy if they ever got the opportunity to see this at a live show. The rock hip-hop song flows aggressively and builds up excitement for the chorus that is filled with chants that remind me, in a nostalgic way, of the rebellious phase each teenager goes through at a certain point in life. The performers find it easy to convey the youthful feeling of not fitting in, and they let us know that that exact feeling is what makes us special and what gives us the spirit to make a difference in this world.
- loveholic""Answer"" - ATEEZOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
ATEEZ were my discovery of the year. While I had enjoyed their previous singles like, ""Wonderland"" and ""Wave"", I had never tried to dive deeper into their discography. However, following their performance at the 2019 Mnet Asian Music Awards, I had to check them out. ""Answer"" was a very early 2020 comeback but it has remained my Top boy group track of 2020. After listening to the 'Treasure' series of albums by ATEEZ and seeing their musical journey begin from ""Pirate King"" and ""Treasure"", and the culmination of their adventure is very evident in ""Answer"". Not just lyrically but sonically as well, the track sounds like a well-deserved celebration. It only helps that the song is an absolute banger with a killer choreography. I honestly believe that with ""Answer"" and now ""Inception"", ATEEZ have found their sound and are on a trajectory to mega-stardom.
- ssaa10dec""Maria"" - HwasaOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
""Maria"" is one of the first Korean songs I had ever heard. It's a really unique track with a lot of diverse elements. In the beginning, I only kept listening to ""Maria"" whenever it came up in my playlists, but eventually, I decided to look up the lyrics. To have learned what this song is really about is quite shocking. Although ""Maria"" is an upbeat song, it talks about the hate in Hwasa's journey. At this point in her life, she's fed up with it and she gives herself the empowering message to stop focusing on the negative people and just love herself instead.
- EleventhCassette""ÏÇ¥Ïßù ÏÑ§Î†úÏñ¥ (Nonstop)"" - OH MY GIRLOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
When the song was released in end-April, any escape from the daily life in lockdown was more than welcome ‚Äì and 'Nonstop', with its cheerful beat, innocent lyrics, and colorful music video, instantly set up a positive and optimistic mood, away from ambient gloominess and uncertainty. Its tropical pop sound felt refreshing and energizing for the upcoming summer; this, along with the group showing us a bolder side of them, especially with Mimi's rap verses, made this song one of the most exciting releases of the year in my opinion.
- ab212""Jazz Bar"" - DREAMCATCHEROriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
DREAMCATCHER is mainly known for being the baddest and rockiest Korean girl group this decade, mixing EDM and heavy metal like it's nothing. While I was listening to their debut album Dystopia: The Tree of Language, I was surprised by the sudden change in ""Jazz Bar"" with a modern take on the genre. Surprised and not disappointed at all. This song makes me very nostalgic of songs like Wham's ""Careless Whisper"" or even Lily Allen's ""Smile"".
- EleventhCassette""Up No More"" - TWICEOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
When I first heard TWICE‚Äôs album, I was pulled towards this song because it was bright, captivating, and had an oddly relaxing melody. As I did more research, I discovered that TWICE's Jihyo wrote the song while she was suffering from insomnia. Although I don't suffer from insomnia, I was feeling very restless and this song acted as my ‚Äúemotional breather,‚Äù making me feel more relaxed and at peace with myself. It's a great gift from Jihyo, knowing her background. As she started training in 2005, she and her health have more than likely been victims of the K-Pop industry's harsh expectations of perfection. This song from her makes me realize that if she could persevere and face the world to reach her dreams, I can too.
- PlanNine16""Ïò§ÎäòÎèÑ Ïó¨Ï†ÑÌûà (Still)"" - DKBOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
During this year I came across this song and from that moment my year changed. The beautiful vocals and rapping are perfectly mixed in this fast-paced love/melancholy song. And keep it low-key, I'm in love with GK voice. After this song, I quickly went and listen to everything DKB had released and every song is a little work of art. Now I'm a big BB (DKB's fandom). In my humble opinion, I can say without any doubt that DKB are the biggest revelation in 2020, but the fact that they are so underrated makes me very sad. Go and give those guys a listen!
- TheArteek""HOME;RUN"" - SeventeenOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
""Left & Right"" might be the song of summer this year but I really think, ""HOME;RUN"" is the superior song (but still behind the magnificent ""Falling Flower""). ""HOME;RUN"" is the perfect product of Seventeen's classic high energy, quirky sound blended with the 2020's retro style that swept the music industry this year. The song, therefore, showed Woozi's producing genius. He constantly amazes me with every Seventeen comeback. The music video for the song was one of the best of this year. Filled with Seventeen's silliness, bright colors, and a hilarious storyline, the music video was everything and more. P.S. they all looked dapper but Joshua in silver hair is just on a whole other level.

""Dear My Friend"" was something I didn't expect from Agust D. I wasn't much active on Genius to help out with the song but I remember listening to it and the tone with the piano was just amazing. The more ballad-like tone really made me love it even more! When I went to the English Translation while listening to it and immediately teared up. I loved the song since due to the whole pandemic I wasn't able to see a good friend of mine and I feel that we maybe have drifted apart. Especially the line that parallels ""Spring Day,"" that goes like,
""Was it you who changed? Or was it me? Uh
I hate this flowing time, it's us who changed""
I can relate to Agust D and that line in particular as I've seen many who were good friends turn on each other and went separate ways. They just move on. To them, life goes on. For Agust D to have put this as the ending for D-2 just showcases the lyrical genius he is. Hopefully, if this pandemic ends, I can chat with my friend and catch up.
- Hobschiske""Îç§ÎçîÎüº (Dumhdurum)"" - ApinkOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
The veteran Kpop girl group, Apink reinvented their style in 2018 and have since released some of the most sophisticated songs in Kpop. The song was produced by the legendary producer, Black Eyed Pilseung, the duo behind several Kpop hits. With ‚ÄúÎç§ÎçîÎüº (Dumhdurum)‚Äù, the ladies of Apink showed a maturer side of love and heartbreak not only through their lyrics but also their sound. With the song, Apink tackles the stereotypes of ageism in the entertainment industry. The song became their 4th Top 10 hit on the Billboard World Digital Songs chart. Apink is living proof that it is possible for K-Pop idols to evolve and age gracefully with their fans. They have managed to retain their fans who came to love them in 2011 and have gained new fans in today's industry. My only wish is for Apink to have more than one comeback each year.
- ssaa10dec""God's Menu"" - Stray KidsOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
Most will remember this track as ‚Äúthat cooking song,‚Äù but this intense and addictive track is a good preview of what Stray Kids have to offer. ‚ÄúÁ•ûÎ©îÎâ¥ (God's Menu)‚Äù is full of cooking metaphors that represent Stray Kids' uniqueness and their resistance of fitting into the mold crafted by the K-Pop industry. Furthermore, the song highlights Stray Kids' strengths beautifully. The group's producing unit, 3RACHA, brought the track to life: making sure to keep Stray Kids' signature flair while also implementing unfamiliar but addictive sounds. Moreover, the group uniquely showed off their all-roundedness, with members that rapped, sang, and even some that did both. Felix's captivating voice was utilized really well throughout the track, turning heads whenever his parts came up. This song may only be a taste of what Stray Kids have to offer, but I believe its many elements perfectly summarizes their abilities.
- PlanNine16""Stay Tonight"" - Chung HaOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
'Stay Tonight' has all the features one could expect from a Chung Ha single: sultry vocals, a strong build-up to the chorus, and overall dynamic production allowing impressive dance performances showcasing her talent. But what really sets the song apart from her other singles, and as one of the most striking songs of the year, are its atmospheric, mysterious vibe; its 90's influences and incorporation of harps and piano; and her vocal delivery, both seductive and impressive (those high notes right before the choruses and bridge!). As a whole, it sounds very unique and does a great job creating hype for her first full album.
- ab212""ÏóêÏûá (eight)"" - IU (ft. SUGA)Original Song | Romanization | English Translation
Korean songstress, IU joined forces with BTS member Suga to release an uplifting anthem for turning 28 years old. This song was obviously going to be extremely popular not just in Korea but also internationally. But after hearing the song and reading its lyrics, I was happy that it gained all the popularity. The two artists aged 28, sang about the challenges of being a certain age in the music industry but also the joys of being an adult. It was also really nice to hear that the song might have been dedicated to IU's friends, Goo Hara and Jonghyun. The song followed IU‚Äôs age-themed hits like 2015‚Äôs ‚ÄúÏä§Î¨ºÏÖã (Twenty-three)‚Äù and 2017‚Äôs ‚ÄúPalette‚Äù. Each song including ‚ÄúEight‚Äù is written as a self-reflection of her year. Combining the popularity of the two singers, the song debuted at #1 on both South Korean charts and the Billboard World Digital Songs chart.
- ssaa10dec""Ghosting"" - TOMORROW X TOGETHEROriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
From the first seconds, I knew this song was going to be great. My breath was taken. ""Ghosting"" has a very dreamy sound, it reminds me of tracks like G-Dragon's ""CROOKED"" or Emarosa's ""IW2WY"". I don't know a lot of Korean, but all the angsty feelings were expressed very clearly throughout the vocal and instrumental melodies. Once I looked up the lyrics, I think it's easily relatable to anyone. The story is told through a lot of metaphors and references to social media. While I normally find the latter kind of cringy, I'm a sucker for metaphors, and also‚Ä¶ that's just life. We exist in the digital era, a lot of quarrels happen online and it's part of how our world works nowadays. People are meant to come and go in our lives, they're only here to stay in our memories.
- EleventhCassette""Kick It"" - NCT 127Original Song | Romanization | English Translation
Something I enjoy about NCT 127 is how experimental their music is, though they always maintain the group's signature sound. ""Kick It"" is one of the few songs I liked from the moment I first listened to it and it can rightfully be described as experimental; starting from the chorus, which is memorable and catchy, to the rap verses that are energetic enough to get you excited, I had no problem letting myself get lost within the pulsating bass and synth. The powerful song is balanced out with the bridge, which allows you to slow down for a bit while enjoying the melodious voices of the main vocalists. Finally, there is a well-executed high note followed by a breakdown that is showcased through an amazing choreography. The impact ""Kick It"" has had not only on the Korean netizens but also on the international crowd is most definitely expected, considering this song was meant for greatness. In my opinion, this track is an anthem and it marks a before and after in the group‚Äôs career.
- loveholic""Black Swan"" - BTSOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
This blend of R&B, trap, and classical music can seem strange at the first sight but works beautifully. The meaning of the song can be summed up with a paraphrase of the quote from Martha Graham‚Äîthe artists die twice, the first time when they stop doing what they love. The lyrics are very personal and introspective, BTS wrote about the fear of growing distant from their passion for music after being on the stage for more so many years (the group debuted in 2013). This song is definitely timeless. Talking about ""Black Swan"" it's hard to not mention the Orchestral version, that was released with accompany of the art film and is played only during live performances, but definitely should be released officially!
- siannve""Î≥¥ÎùºÎπõ Î∞§ (Pporappippam)"" - SunmiOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
Sunmi has established herself as a reputable and successful soloist in the K-Pop industry. With ""Pporappippam"", Sunmi brought a much-needed breath of freshness to 2020's K-Pop sound. While her tracks, ""Í∞ÄÏãúÎÇò (Gashina)"" and ""ÏÇ¨Ïù¥Î†å (Siren)"" were viral hits and personal favorites of mine, ""Pporappippam"" presented Sunmi's truest self as a performer. It had the nostalgic sound of Wonder Girls discography but still felt modern. With the song's lyrics and visuals, Sunmi painted the imagery contrasting reality and dream. The duality of the song can also be seen in Sunmi's overall persona evident in the wardrobe choices, choreography, and even color scheme for the era. Sunmi has continued to stand-out with her music and performance and she makes it work every single time.
- ssaa10dec""Lovesick Girls"" - BLACKPINKOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
I‚Äôve been enjoying BLACKPINK‚Äôs B-side tracks more than their promotional singles for a while now, from ‚ÄúForever Young‚Äù to ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt know what to do.‚Äù Although ‚ÄúLovesick Girls‚Äù is the third single off of THE ALBUM, it gives me a similar vibe as other B-sides: nothing grand, magnificent, or badass; the girls are having a good time, and it doesn't feel like making a hit was the only thing on Teddy‚Äôs mind when he co-wrote the song. The song takes me back to the early 2010s and the resemblance between ‚ÄúLovesick Girls‚Äù and songs like ‚ÄúAll Night‚Äù and ‚ÄúWake Me Up‚Äù is just uncanny. The contrast between black and pink has appeared in BLACKPINK‚Äôs music videos numerous times in the past, but when Ros√© pours the black paint on the pink wall, it has since become my favorite black-pink-contrast moment ever.
- peaker""Ïö± (UGH!)"" - BTSOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
This B-side from Map of The Soul: 7 somehow fits into 2020 perfectly. Performed by BTS' rap line (RM, SUGA and j-hope), the song discusses sudden and strong anger, but not necessarily as a negative emotion, as it can be used to fuel important changes, no matter if in person‚Äôs life or globally. The Korean word Ïö± (ugh) can means so much depending upon the context, and as the group said it ""includes all of the life's up and downs."" The song can feel almost cathartic‚ÄîAngry? Play ""UGH!"" Frustrated? Play ""UGH!"" Need a boost? Play ""UGH!""
- siannve""Ïù¥Îç∞ÏïÑ (IDEA:ÁêÜÊÉ≥)"" - TaeminOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
""Criminal"" vs. ""IDEA"" is an impossible choice because well Taemin only puts out iconic songs. But the reason I finally went with ""IDEA"" because it really reminded me of his old songs like, ""Í¥¥ÎèÑ (Danger)"" and ""Drip Drop"". The performance-centric songs where Taemin truly shines. The whole concept of aiming for perfection is something only Taemin can do. The concept is intertwined in the song's music video, choreography but also in its lyrics i.e. ""You are my messiah"". Also, nobody can pull off a magenta-colored velvet jacket besides Taemin. BoA's haunting ""Killing Me Softly"" adds to the menacing vibe of the song. I have said this before and I'll say it again, Taemin can do no wrong in my book.
- ssaa10dec""Misfit"" - NCT UOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
There is no better way to introduce a project as big as NCT 2020 than with an addictive 90's themed cypher that features the group's rap line. It is no surprise the group would make a notorious and hefty entrance to let everybody know that NCTzen's most awaited event of the year is on its way. Featuring NCT 127's Mark, Taeyong and Johnny, NCT DREAM's Jeno, WayV's Yangyang and Hendery and NCT U's newest member Sungchan, this song is an explosion of power and energy with a punchy melody that would make anybody go crazy if they ever got the opportunity to see this at a live show. The rock hip-hop song flows aggressively and builds up excitement for the chorus that is filled with chants that remind me, in a nostalgic way, of the rebellious phase each teenager goes through at a certain point in life. The performers find it easy to convey the youthful feeling of not fitting in, and they let us know that that exact feeling is what makes us special and what gives us the spirit to make a difference in this world.
- loveholic""Answer"" - ATEEZOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
ATEEZ were my discovery of the year. While I had enjoyed their previous singles like, ""Wonderland"" and ""Wave"", I had never tried to dive deeper into their discography. However, following their performance at the 2019 Mnet Asian Music Awards, I had to check them out. ""Answer"" was a very early 2020 comeback but it has remained my Top boy group track of 2020. After listening to the 'Treasure' series of albums by ATEEZ and seeing their musical journey begin from ""Pirate King"" and ""Treasure"", and the culmination of their adventure is very evident in ""Answer"". Not just lyrically but sonically as well, the track sounds like a well-deserved celebration. It only helps that the song is an absolute banger with a killer choreography. I honestly believe that with ""Answer"" and now ""Inception"", ATEEZ have found their sound and are on a trajectory to mega-stardom.
- ssaa10dec""Maria"" - HwasaOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
""Maria"" is one of the first Korean songs I had ever heard. It's a really unique track with a lot of diverse elements. In the beginning, I only kept listening to ""Maria"" whenever it came up in my playlists, but eventually, I decided to look up the lyrics. To have learned what this song is really about is quite shocking. Although ""Maria"" is an upbeat song, it talks about the hate in Hwasa's journey. At this point in her life, she's fed up with it and she gives herself the empowering message to stop focusing on the negative people and just love herself instead.
- EleventhCassette""ÏÇ¥Ïßù ÏÑ§Î†úÏñ¥ (Nonstop)"" - OH MY GIRLOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
When the song was released in end-April, any escape from the daily life in lockdown was more than welcome ‚Äì and 'Nonstop', with its cheerful beat, innocent lyrics, and colorful music video, instantly set up a positive and optimistic mood, away from ambient gloominess and uncertainty. Its tropical pop sound felt refreshing and energizing for the upcoming summer; this, along with the group showing us a bolder side of them, especially with Mimi's rap verses, made this song one of the most exciting releases of the year in my opinion.
- ab212""Jazz Bar"" - DREAMCATCHEROriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
DREAMCATCHER is mainly known for being the baddest and rockiest Korean girl group this decade, mixing EDM and heavy metal like it's nothing. While I was listening to their debut album Dystopia: The Tree of Language, I was surprised by the sudden change in ""Jazz Bar"" with a modern take on the genre. Surprised and not disappointed at all. This song makes me very nostalgic of songs like Wham's ""Careless Whisper"" or even Lily Allen's ""Smile"".
- EleventhCassette""Up No More"" - TWICEOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
When I first heard TWICE‚Äôs album, I was pulled towards this song because it was bright, captivating, and had an oddly relaxing melody. As I did more research, I discovered that TWICE's Jihyo wrote the song while she was suffering from insomnia. Although I don't suffer from insomnia, I was feeling very restless and this song acted as my ‚Äúemotional breather,‚Äù making me feel more relaxed and at peace with myself. It's a great gift from Jihyo, knowing her background. As she started training in 2005, she and her health have more than likely been victims of the K-Pop industry's harsh expectations of perfection. This song from her makes me realize that if she could persevere and face the world to reach her dreams, I can too.
- PlanNine16""Ïò§ÎäòÎèÑ Ïó¨Ï†ÑÌûà (Still)"" - DKBOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
During this year I came across this song and from that moment my year changed. The beautiful vocals and rapping are perfectly mixed in this fast-paced love/melancholy song. And keep it low-key, I'm in love with GK voice. After this song, I quickly went and listen to everything DKB had released and every song is a little work of art. Now I'm a big BB (DKB's fandom). In my humble opinion, I can say without any doubt that DKB are the biggest revelation in 2020, but the fact that they are so underrated makes me very sad. Go and give those guys a listen!

""Left & Right"" might be the song of summer this year but I really think, ""HOME;RUN"" is the superior song (but still behind the magnificent ""Falling Flower""). ""HOME;RUN"" is the perfect product of Seventeen's classic high energy, quirky sound blended with the 2020's retro style that swept the music industry this year. The song, therefore, showed Woozi's producing genius. He constantly amazes me with every Seventeen comeback. The music video for the song was one of the best of this year. Filled with Seventeen's silliness, bright colors, and a hilarious storyline, the music video was everything and more. P.S. they all looked dapper but Joshua in silver hair is just on a whole other level.

Anthony Fantano here ‚Äì of TheNeedleDrop YouTube channel ‚Äì and, um, here, hitting you with a list of ten albums that prove you were not born in le wrong generation. There is, uh, a group of people out there ‚Äì they're not a closely-knit or a, uh, consciously created or assembled group but they are a group nonetheless ‚Äì of individuals who really fetishize the musical eras of the sixties, the seventies, occasionally the fifties, arguing that there was just very little in the way of crap, of bad music back then. Just‚Äî just wasn't as much, just wasn't happening, and, uh, sometimes, these people will go as far as to argue that there is just a severe deficiency of good music today. Just all the good and interesting music happened back then and all the interesting music is just not occurring right now. ""I mean, just listen to the radio, you hear all these songs about club and smoking pot and so on and so forth and sex and blah blah blah blah blah!"" As if that's not what songs back then were ever about but that's besides the point. These people seem to wish that they were born decades ago just so that they could be alive at the release of, of some of these records. But what I wanna bring up in this video are ten records I think are very much well-worth being alive today for. There are new albums coming out that, in my opinion, are proof that contemporary music is nothing to write off.Vektor ‚Äì Black Future (2009)And our first LP is going to be Vektor's Black Future. These guys are a metal band, thrash metal band, black metal band, fusing the two styles together with just intense performance speeds, great vocal performances, awesome riff and melody writing. They very much pay attention to the roots of these genres and pay homage to the greats but are also incredibly progressive with not only how they bring these two genres together but also with how they treat each one individually with just some really crisp production and some very airy, reverby effects and lyrics that deal a lot with, uh, space, just intergalactic stuff. There's definitely an element of sci-fi in Vektor's music which makes it undeniably entertaining. And this record and the following record they dropped after this one make me happy to be a part of today's world of music.Kendrick Lamar ‚Äì good kid, m.A.A.d city (2012)
As well as Kendrick Lamar's good kid, m.A.A.d city. Kendrick Lamar: fantastic, talented, vividly lyrical West Coast rapper and this LP right here, his sophomore album, is, essentially, so far, his masterpiece and one of the most conceptual and entertaining story albums in hip hop ever. There are fantastic instrumentals on this thing. Kendrick Lamar has a great flow track for track for track. Each song feels like a vignette or a scene in this ongoing tale and the kid that Kendrick Lamar plays on this album seems to be a young version of himself who kinda gets caught up in the wrong crowd and eventually finds himself at this crossroads where, is he going to continue screwing up or is he gonna take things more seriously, take music more seriously and sort of elevate his life and become more successful? There are moving tracks on this thing, there are bangers, and overall it's a really compelling personal story.Joanna Newsom ‚Äì Ys (2006)Next I have to give it to Joanna Newsom's Ys, one of the most creative, opulent, and strange folk music albums to come out in recent years. Not only does her harp playing set Joanna Newsom apart from most popular performers out there today, but here very unique and eccentric vocals which are impassioned and‚Äî and very twangy also make her a‚Äî a very unique modern voice in music as well. There are loads of very beautiful, mystical songs all over this record. And even with the sixties being perceived as the peak of American folk music revivalism, Joanna Newsom is proof that there are plenty of modern amazing, enthralling singer-songwriters out there today.Daft Punk ‚Äì Discovery (2001)This next pick is for that friend of yours who might hear you listening to some electronic music and might argue that ""Hey, that's not actually real music. Who's actually playing an instrument?"" Daft Punk's Discovery. These guys are a French DJ/electronic music duo who have been making amazing pop/house fusions for years and the album Discovery is a fantastic, amazing concept album loaded with stellar songs. Hard-hitting house-pop bangers as well as some very smooth, soulful ballads too. Daft Punk shows themselves to be incredibly diverse in their production and writing talents and shows that electronic music can show an incredible amount of humanity. Not that that's every really been a question for people who are in the know but for somebody who might question electronic music at its very foundation might need some convincing and if Daft Punk doesn't convince you, I don't know what will.The Strokes ‚Äì Is This It (2001)And The Strokes with their early 2000s album Is This It, to me,
is proof that pop rock still has a lot more potential. The really suave, sharp guitar chords and leads all over this thing. The punchy drumbeats. Julian Casablancas' very swagger-filled, deep vocals. In my opinion, this record is passionate, it's sexy, it's instantaneous. Songs that just burn themselves into my eardrums after one single listen. And even after ten years of listening to this album, I still get whisked up in it when I play to this day. So yes, incredible pop rock album.Janelle Mon√°e ‚Äì The ArchAndroid (2010)
And following that, Janelle Mon√°e's The ArchAndroid ‚Äì amazing modern R&B album. Not really buying into a lot of the stereotypes and clich√©s that typically come with commercial radio R&B music but instead, Janelle Mon√°e finds ways to make this genre sound incredibly new, progressive, and futuristic while going back and tributing the greats of this genre and soul, too. Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder, as well as Michael Jackson, Prince. And she also gives nods to modern hip hop and indie pop, too. It's a long, diverse, conceptual album loaded with beautiful songs, great production, fantastic singing, creative songwriting. This album is illustrious, it's extravagant, it's got a huge vision. If you're the kind of person who loves their music to sound cinematic, sound like it's got a big idea or a big, grand picture to show you, then I think you're going to love this LP.Sufjan Stevens - Illinois (2005)That is also the case for this next album, too: singer-songwriter Sufjan Stevens' Illinoise, or Illinois or Come On and Feel the Illinoise. Sufjan Stevens is one of today's most interesting multi-instrumentalists and songwriters. From folk music to huge, grand, ambitious baroque pop, this album has a lot to offer. Moving songs, introspective lyrics, very interesting song topics, and illustrious instrumentation. It's an album whose gentle and‚Äî and very‚Äî and moving nature is complimented with some of the most gorgeous instrumentation ever layed onto an indie pop or indie folk record I've ever heard.Godspeed You! Black Emperor ‚Äì Lift Your Skinny Fists Like Antennas To Heaven (2000)
Another grand record in this list here, I have to say, is Godspeed You! Black Emperor's Lift Your Skinny Fists Like Antennas To Heaven. Godspeed, a Canadian band, they've put out numerous records over the years and, in my opinion, one of the only bands to truly perfect the idea of taking rock instrumentation and giving it sort of a classical twist while still maintaining that rawness that you expect in a great rock record. And with guitars and drums and horns and strings, the band presents these huge, harrowing, ascending musical passages that have the detail and the finesse and the depth and the weight of an orchestral piece but, in a way, also carry the‚Äî the intensity and the ferocity of a punk band. There're also loads of‚Äî of strange avant-garde and drone and ambient pieces all throughout this record. This is another LP on this list that, in my opinion, is incredibly cinematic. Listening to this album, sitting down, listening to this album is a lot like just watching a film. And what images are set to that film, I guess, is sort of dependent on your imagination. But with some of the weird field recordings and‚Äî and vocal snippets and samples that play throughout this record occasionally, what exactly Godspeed is getting at philosophically, socially, politically with some of these songs isn't really left up to the imagination. It's a record that has a message to it as well, despite the‚Äî the lack of lyrics. And even though the mission statement of this record isn't exactly direct, it's kinda hard to ignore just how apocalyptic some of the vibes are on this LP.Tim Hecker ‚Äì Virgins (2013)
Another Canadian artist on this list: Tim Hecker with his album Virgins. Another artist who deals in ambient music as well, some drone. But Tim Hecker is‚Äî is much less minimalist than a lot of the artists typically associated with that genre. Despite a lot of his tunes essentially being these amorphous, blobby, somewhat directionless and vast soundscapes, he really finds ways to make them interesting by just layering them and layering them with numerous sounds and‚Äî and melodies and even though the pace and the‚Äî and the direction of the tracks all over this record may not exactly be clear or transmitted to the listener through a very prominent rhythm, this album does have a pace to it and you don't feel like you're just listening to one piece after another piece, but the entire record itself feels connected. Connected musically, sonically, and‚Äî and emotionally, too. Because not only are there some apocalyptic vibes on this album as well, but the moods of a lot of these songs are‚Äî are very forlorn. And Tim Hecker portrays these emotions really well with these really enveloping sheets and waves of sound.Flying Lotus ‚Äì Cosmogramma (2010)
And finally on this list, I have to give a shout out to Flying Lotus with his album Cosmogramma. One thing I love about Flying Lotus contextually is that, despite the fact that electronic music, jazz, and hip hop have a lot in common, on the surface most people don't really seem to assume so and‚Äî and I think that's partially because of how different people view those cultures to be, whether that be because of the group of people listening to that music or the time period that music was popular within. But Flying Lotus is one of the few artists out there who's actually been able to bring all these together in such a way where it's compelling, even to people who might not even really be all that familiar with the genres that serve as Flying Lotus' source material. His talents when it comes to producing instrumentals is so great that he sort of transcends these genres and‚Äî and grabs the ears of people from across the spectrum of these genres too. And nowhere in his discography thus far is this done better on his album Cosmogramma. An album that not only fuses these genres together in a really amazing way, but also makes each one of them sound like they're coming down from a different planet and landing onto Earth because aliens just gave them to us as, like, a present. This album is funky, it's groovy, it's jazzy, it's interstellar, it's imaginative, and it is yet another album that I think proves that modern music, contemporary music, popular music, has quite a bit to offer.
So no, if you dig hard enough, if you dig deep enough, uh, you were not born in the wrong musical generation. There's still a lot of good stuff going on right now. Cool? Cool. Anthony Fantano, music, forever.Embed",en,LABEL_0,0.520693838596344,LABEL_1,0.4793061912059784

""Dear My Friend"" was something I didn't expect from Agust D. I wasn't much active on Genius to help out with the song but I remember listening to it and the tone with the piano was just amazing. The more ballad-like tone really made me love it even more! When I went to the English Translation while listening to it and immediately teared up. I loved the song since due to the whole pandemic I wasn't able to see a good friend of mine and I feel that we maybe have drifted apart. Especially the line that parallels ""Spring Day,"" that goes like,
""Was it you who changed? Or was it me? Uh
I hate this flowing time, it's us who changed""
I can relate to Agust D and that line in particular as I've seen many who were good friends turn on each other and went separate ways. They just move on. To them, life goes on. For Agust D to have put this as the ending for D-2 just showcases the lyrical genius he is. Hopefully, if this pandemic ends, I can chat with my friend and catch up.
- Hobschiske""Îç§ÎçîÎüº (Dumhdurum)"" - ApinkOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
The veteran Kpop girl group, Apink reinvented their style in 2018 and have since released some of the most sophisticated songs in Kpop. The song was produced by the legendary producer, Black Eyed Pilseung, the duo behind several Kpop hits. With ‚ÄúÎç§ÎçîÎüº (Dumhdurum)‚Äù, the ladies of Apink showed a maturer side of love and heartbreak not only through their lyrics but also their sound. With the song, Apink tackles the stereotypes of ageism in the entertainment industry. The song became their 4th Top 10 hit on the Billboard World Digital Songs chart. Apink is living proof that it is possible for K-Pop idols to evolve and age gracefully with their fans. They have managed to retain their fans who came to love them in 2011 and have gained new fans in today's industry. My only wish is for Apink to have more than one comeback each year.
- ssaa10dec""God's Menu"" - Stray KidsOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
Most will remember this track as ‚Äúthat cooking song,‚Äù but this intense and addictive track is a good preview of what Stray Kids have to offer. ‚ÄúÁ•ûÎ©îÎâ¥ (God's Menu)‚Äù is full of cooking metaphors that represent Stray Kids' uniqueness and their resistance of fitting into the mold crafted by the K-Pop industry. Furthermore, the song highlights Stray Kids' strengths beautifully. The group's producing unit, 3RACHA, brought the track to life: making sure to keep Stray Kids' signature flair while also implementing unfamiliar but addictive sounds. Moreover, the group uniquely showed off their all-roundedness, with members that rapped, sang, and even some that did both. Felix's captivating voice was utilized really well throughout the track, turning heads whenever his parts came up. This song may only be a taste of what Stray Kids have to offer, but I believe its many elements perfectly summarizes their abilities.
- PlanNine16""Stay Tonight"" - Chung HaOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
'Stay Tonight' has all the features one could expect from a Chung Ha single: sultry vocals, a strong build-up to the chorus, and overall dynamic production allowing impressive dance performances showcasing her talent. But what really sets the song apart from her other singles, and as one of the most striking songs of the year, are its atmospheric, mysterious vibe; its 90's influences and incorporation of harps and piano; and her vocal delivery, both seductive and impressive (those high notes right before the choruses and bridge!). As a whole, it sounds very unique and does a great job creating hype for her first full album.
- ab212""ÏóêÏûá (eight)"" - IU (ft. SUGA)Original Song | Romanization | English Translation
Korean songstress, IU joined forces with BTS member Suga to release an uplifting anthem for turning 28 years old. This song was obviously going to be extremely popular not just in Korea but also internationally. But after hearing the song and reading its lyrics, I was happy that it gained all the popularity. The two artists aged 28, sang about the challenges of being a certain age in the music industry but also the joys of being an adult. It was also really nice to hear that the song might have been dedicated to IU's friends, Goo Hara and Jonghyun. The song followed IU‚Äôs age-themed hits like 2015‚Äôs ‚ÄúÏä§Î¨ºÏÖã (Twenty-three)‚Äù and 2017‚Äôs ‚ÄúPalette‚Äù. Each song including ‚ÄúEight‚Äù is written as a self-reflection of her year. Combining the popularity of the two singers, the song debuted at #1 on both South Korean charts and the Billboard World Digital Songs chart.
- ssaa10dec""Ghosting"" - TOMORROW X TOGETHEROriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
From the first seconds, I knew this song was going to be great. My breath was taken. ""Ghosting"" has a very dreamy sound, it reminds me of tracks like G-Dragon's ""CROOKED"" or Emarosa's ""IW2WY"". I don't know a lot of Korean, but all the angsty feelings were expressed very clearly throughout the vocal and instrumental melodies. Once I looked up the lyrics, I think it's easily relatable to anyone. The story is told through a lot of metaphors and references to social media. While I normally find the latter kind of cringy, I'm a sucker for metaphors, and also‚Ä¶ that's just life. We exist in the digital era, a lot of quarrels happen online and it's part of how our world works nowadays. People are meant to come and go in our lives, they're only here to stay in our memories.
- EleventhCassette""Kick It"" - NCT 127Original Song | Romanization | English Translation
Something I enjoy about NCT 127 is how experimental their music is, though they always maintain the group's signature sound. ""Kick It"" is one of the few songs I liked from the moment I first listened to it and it can rightfully be described as experimental; starting from the chorus, which is memorable and catchy, to the rap verses that are energetic enough to get you excited, I had no problem letting myself get lost within the pulsating bass and synth. The powerful song is balanced out with the bridge, which allows you to slow down for a bit while enjoying the melodious voices of the main vocalists. Finally, there is a well-executed high note followed by a breakdown that is showcased through an amazing choreography. The impact ""Kick It"" has had not only on the Korean netizens but also on the international crowd is most definitely expected, considering this song was meant for greatness. In my opinion, this track is an anthem and it marks a before and after in the group‚Äôs career.
- loveholic""Black Swan"" - BTSOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
This blend of R&B, trap, and classical music can seem strange at the first sight but works beautifully. The meaning of the song can be summed up with a paraphrase of the quote from Martha Graham‚Äîthe artists die twice, the first time when they stop doing what they love. The lyrics are very personal and introspective, BTS wrote about the fear of growing distant from their passion for music after being on the stage for more so many years (the group debuted in 2013). This song is definitely timeless. Talking about ""Black Swan"" it's hard to not mention the Orchestral version, that was released with accompany of the art film and is played only during live performances, but definitely should be released officially!
- siannve""Î≥¥ÎùºÎπõ Î∞§ (Pporappippam)"" - SunmiOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
Sunmi has established herself as a reputable and successful soloist in the K-Pop industry. With ""Pporappippam"", Sunmi brought a much-needed breath of freshness to 2020's K-Pop sound. While her tracks, ""Í∞ÄÏãúÎÇò (Gashina)"" and ""ÏÇ¨Ïù¥Î†å (Siren)"" were viral hits and personal favorites of mine, ""Pporappippam"" presented Sunmi's truest self as a performer. It had the nostalgic sound of Wonder Girls discography but still felt modern. With the song's lyrics and visuals, Sunmi painted the imagery contrasting reality and dream. The duality of the song can also be seen in Sunmi's overall persona evident in the wardrobe choices, choreography, and even color scheme for the era. Sunmi has continued to stand-out with her music and performance and she makes it work every single time.
- ssaa10dec""Lovesick Girls"" - BLACKPINKOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
I‚Äôve been enjoying BLACKPINK‚Äôs B-side tracks more than their promotional singles for a while now, from ‚ÄúForever Young‚Äù to ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt know what to do.‚Äù Although ‚ÄúLovesick Girls‚Äù is the third single off of THE ALBUM, it gives me a similar vibe as other B-sides: nothing grand, magnificent, or badass; the girls are having a good time, and it doesn't feel like making a hit was the only thing on Teddy‚Äôs mind when he co-wrote the song. The song takes me back to the early 2010s and the resemblance between ‚ÄúLovesick Girls‚Äù and songs like ‚ÄúAll Night‚Äù and ‚ÄúWake Me Up‚Äù is just uncanny. The contrast between black and pink has appeared in BLACKPINK‚Äôs music videos numerous times in the past, but when Ros√© pours the black paint on the pink wall, it has since become my favorite black-pink-contrast moment ever.
- peaker""Ïö± (UGH!)"" - BTSOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
This B-side from Map of The Soul: 7 somehow fits into 2020 perfectly. Performed by BTS' rap line (RM, SUGA and j-hope), the song discusses sudden and strong anger, but not necessarily as a negative emotion, as it can be used to fuel important changes, no matter if in person‚Äôs life or globally. The Korean word Ïö± (ugh) can means so much depending upon the context, and as the group said it ""includes all of the life's up and downs."" The song can feel almost cathartic‚ÄîAngry? Play ""UGH!"" Frustrated? Play ""UGH!"" Need a boost? Play ""UGH!""
- siannve""Ïù¥Îç∞ÏïÑ (IDEA:ÁêÜÊÉ≥)"" - TaeminOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
""Criminal"" vs. ""IDEA"" is an impossible choice because well Taemin only puts out iconic songs. But the reason I finally went with ""IDEA"" because it really reminded me of his old songs like, ""Í¥¥ÎèÑ (Danger)"" and ""Drip Drop"". The performance-centric songs where Taemin truly shines. The whole concept of aiming for perfection is something only Taemin can do. The concept is intertwined in the song's music video, choreography but also in its lyrics i.e. ""You are my messiah"". Also, nobody can pull off a magenta-colored velvet jacket besides Taemin. BoA's haunting ""Killing Me Softly"" adds to the menacing vibe of the song. I have said this before and I'll say it again, Taemin can do no wrong in my book.
- ssaa10dec""Misfit"" - NCT UOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
There is no better way to introduce a project as big as NCT 2020 than with an addictive 90's themed cypher that features the group's rap line. It is no surprise the group would make a notorious and hefty entrance to let everybody know that NCTzen's most awaited event of the year is on its way. Featuring NCT 127's Mark, Taeyong and Johnny, NCT DREAM's Jeno, WayV's Yangyang and Hendery and NCT U's newest member Sungchan, this song is an explosion of power and energy with a punchy melody that would make anybody go crazy if they ever got the opportunity to see this at a live show. The rock hip-hop song flows aggressively and builds up excitement for the chorus that is filled with chants that remind me, in a nostalgic way, of the rebellious phase each teenager goes through at a certain point in life. The performers find it easy to convey the youthful feeling of not fitting in, and they let us know that that exact feeling is what makes us special and what gives us the spirit to make a difference in this world.
- loveholic""Answer"" - ATEEZOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
ATEEZ were my discovery of the year. While I had enjoyed their previous singles like, ""Wonderland"" and ""Wave"", I had never tried to dive deeper into their discography. However, following their performance at the 2019 Mnet Asian Music Awards, I had to check them out. ""Answer"" was a very early 2020 comeback but it has remained my Top boy group track of 2020. After listening to the 'Treasure' series of albums by ATEEZ and seeing their musical journey begin from ""Pirate King"" and ""Treasure"", and the culmination of their adventure is very evident in ""Answer"". Not just lyrically but sonically as well, the track sounds like a well-deserved celebration. It only helps that the song is an absolute banger with a killer choreography. I honestly believe that with ""Answer"" and now ""Inception"", ATEEZ have found their sound and are on a trajectory to mega-stardom.
- ssaa10dec""Maria"" - HwasaOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
""Maria"" is one of the first Korean songs I had ever heard. It's a really unique track with a lot of diverse elements. In the beginning, I only kept listening to ""Maria"" whenever it came up in my playlists, but eventually, I decided to look up the lyrics. To have learned what this song is really about is quite shocking. Although ""Maria"" is an upbeat song, it talks about the hate in Hwasa's journey. At this point in her life, she's fed up with it and she gives herself the empowering message to stop focusing on the negative people and just love herself instead.
- EleventhCassette""ÏÇ¥Ïßù ÏÑ§Î†úÏñ¥ (Nonstop)"" - OH MY GIRLOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
When the song was released in end-April, any escape from the daily life in lockdown was more than welcome ‚Äì and 'Nonstop', with its cheerful beat, innocent lyrics, and colorful music video, instantly set up a positive and optimistic mood, away from ambient gloominess and uncertainty. Its tropical pop sound felt refreshing and energizing for the upcoming summer; this, along with the group showing us a bolder side of them, especially with Mimi's rap verses, made this song one of the most exciting releases of the year in my opinion.
- ab212""Jazz Bar"" - DREAMCATCHEROriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
DREAMCATCHER is mainly known for being the baddest and rockiest Korean girl group this decade, mixing EDM and heavy metal like it's nothing. While I was listening to their debut album Dystopia: The Tree of Language, I was surprised by the sudden change in ""Jazz Bar"" with a modern take on the genre. Surprised and not disappointed at all. This song makes me very nostalgic of songs like Wham's ""Careless Whisper"" or even Lily Allen's ""Smile"".
- EleventhCassette""Up No More"" - TWICEOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
When I first heard TWICE‚Äôs album, I was pulled towards this song because it was bright, captivating, and had an oddly relaxing melody. As I did more research, I discovered that TWICE's Jihyo wrote the song while she was suffering from insomnia. Although I don't suffer from insomnia, I was feeling very restless and this song acted as my ‚Äúemotional breather,‚Äù making me feel more relaxed and at peace with myself. It's a great gift from Jihyo, knowing her background. As she started training in 2005, she and her health have more than likely been victims of the K-Pop industry's harsh expectations of perfection. This song from her makes me realize that if she could persevere and face the world to reach her dreams, I can too.
- PlanNine16""Ïò§ÎäòÎèÑ Ïó¨Ï†ÑÌûà (Still)"" - DKBOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
During this year I came across this song and from that moment my year changed. The beautiful vocals and rapping are perfectly mixed in this fast-paced love/melancholy song. And keep it low-key, I'm in love with GK voice. After this song, I quickly went and listen to everything DKB had released and every song is a little work of art. Now I'm a big BB (DKB's fandom). In my humble opinion, I can say without any doubt that DKB are the biggest revelation in 2020, but the fact that they are so underrated makes me very sad. Go and give those guys a listen!
- TheArteek""HOME;RUN"" - SeventeenOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation
""Left & Right"" might be the song of summer this year but I really think, ""HOME;RUN"" is the superior song (but still behind the magnificent ""Falling Flower""). ""HOME;RUN"" is the perfect product of Seventeen's classic high energy, quirky sound blended with the 2020's retro style that swept the music industry this year. The song, therefore, showed Woozi's producing genius. He constantly amazes me with every Seventeen comeback. The music video for the song was one of the best of this year. Filled with Seventeen's silliness, bright colors, and a hilarious storyline, the music video was everything and more. P.S. they all looked dapper but Joshua in silver hair is just on a whole other level.

I could also rant like I always do about end-of-year lists and how I especially chose to write this on the first day of the new year, because 2014 wasn‚Äôt done before all the big magazines and websites started publishing their top 10s. But maybe I could break the general rule of posts appearing on this blog and actually get to the point as soon as I start. This is going to be long, because I tried to make a top 10 and ended up with a top 15 and even more runner-ups just falling out. Yay!
Honorable mentions
These are albums that didn‚Äôt make the list, but still deserve a place in this post because they are great for some reason. The list is alphabetically by artist; there‚Äôs no ranking here.
Arsenal‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäFuru: A great, varied fifth album by the world music influenced producer duo, and their best so far. From the softer, guitar-driven ‚ÄúSharp Teeth‚Äù to the memorable electronic ‚ÄúBlack Mountain (Beautiful Love)‚Äù, Arsenal manage to keep you entertained.
BRNS‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäPatine: A great set of experimental, inventive Belgian indie rock tracks. Very good overall, especially the first half is quite strong. Not everything is at the same level, but they‚Äôve managed to make it a very enjoyable effort.
Childcare ¬≠‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäFlush EP: A great set of punk-influenced indie rock songs, produced by To Kill A King‚Äôs Ben Jackson, but ultimately not an album, so not eligible for this list. It‚Äôs very promising though, I can‚Äôt wait for a proper debut album to come out.
Cloud Boat‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäModel of You: A very atmospheric but happier follow-up to last year‚Äôs debut. Well-crafted and variated.
Damon Albarn‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäEveryday Robots: The proper debut solo LP from the genius from Gorillaz and Blur. Very emotional and personal, but with some uplifting surprises. If you‚Äôre looking for action, you‚Äôll be disappointed, but if you‚Äôre relaxing, this is perfect.
Ed Sheeran‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää√ó: A more eclectic and variated album than the British singer-songwriter‚Äôs first studio album, and overall more enjoyable. Very realistic and raw lyrics from real life, but usually quite upbeat and even showing off some of his great rap skills.
Febueder‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäLilac Lane EP: Brilliant experimental EP, but again too short to be an album and be on this list. It‚Äôs still brilliant though, in its style-blending gapless fashion.
Girls In Hawaii‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäHello Strange: Awesome live rendition of stuff from their previous albums, everything is reworked with dedication to make the tracks sound great and they shine.
GoGo Penguin‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääv2.0: Mercury Prize-nominated neo-jazz album. Very original and inventive, but not extremely varied, although still very nice.
The Griswolds ¬≠‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäBe Impressive: Long-awaited debut album from the Australian indie pop band. Very catchy and earworm-filled, and everytime you‚Äôd think they‚Äôre just a one-trick pony they come up with something totally different.
Hozier‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäHozier: Take Me to Church was amazing when it came out at the beginning of 2014, now radio has ruined it completely, but this album is Hozier at his best for the whole thing, not just the first track. From bluesrock to gospel, everything‚Äôs there.
Jungle‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäJungle: A great debut for this British neo-soul collective, but it feels more like a collection of potential singles than a real album, except for the brilliant interlude ‚ÄúSmoking Pixels‚Äù then. Most of it is great though, I‚Äôd just wish for it to be more varied.
King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäI‚Äôm In Your Mind Fuzz: Starting out with a locked-groove driven 12 and a half minute long jam spread over four tracks, this doesn‚Äôt really seem like an all that exciting album on paper, but it‚Äôs very variated and twisted and that makes it great.
Magic Man‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäBefore the Waves: Synthrock at its best, although I think this would‚Äôve been even better had they continued the indie rock-influenced sound of ‚ÄúNova Scotia‚Äù, the only EP track not on the album, but still great overall.
Pink Floyd‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäThe Endless River: A beautiful swansong to Richard Wright, Pink Floyd making ambient turns out extremely well and this is a high note to end their career.
Rag‚Äôn‚ÄôBone Man‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäWolves EP: His incredible voice combined with the great style-blending collaborative music makes this EP a must-try.
SOHN‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäTremors: Not on the list because I only really started listening to this one in January 2015 (this pick was added later on), but it definitely deserves a place in there. His amazing falsetto combined with the alternative R&B electronica is really great, the only real issue is that the overall theme is quite depressing through the whole album.
To Kill A King‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäExit, Pursued by a Bear EP: This has got to be one of the best EPs I‚Äôve ever heard, it feels more like a mini-album than an EP if you get what I mean. The placement of the tracks is perfect and this feels like a cohesive journey. Already a classic.
Tom Vek‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäLuck: When Tom Vek is good, he‚Äôs at his best, but sometimes his lyrics seem quite clich√© and unoriginal (even though that is partially due to his extremely clear voice, but the very varied and original thoughts in ‚ÄúThe Girl You Wouldn‚Äôt Leave for Any Other Girl‚Äù don‚Äôt really deserve an award). I think this album would‚Äôve been better if some of the tracks were instrumental, but it‚Äôs still really good. ‚ÄúBroke‚Äù and ‚ÄúSherman (Animals in the Jungle)‚Äù are amazing.
And now, time for the real thing!15
Kasabian‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää48:13
Blending their classic swagger rock sound with electronic experimentation, this is the most innovative and memorable Kasabian record so far. Highlights include ‚ÄúTreat‚Äù, deluxe bonus track ‚ÄúGelfling‚Äù and ‚ÄúClouds‚Äù.14
Dan Croll‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäSweet Disarray
The debut album from a singer-songwriter and musicology student, Sweet Disarray is full of beautiful guitar ballads, electronic experiments and innovative songwriting. You‚Äôve heard ‚ÄúFrom Nowhere‚Äù, also check out ‚ÄúCan You Hear Me‚Äù, ‚ÄúWanna Know‚Äù, ‚ÄúSweet Disarray‚Äù and ‚ÄúNobody Knows‚Äù.13
Cheatahs ‚Äî Cheatahs
Shoegaze at its best. These guys have been around for quite a while now, but only released their debut this year and it‚Äôs awesome. You hear their experience. Check out ‚ÄúIV‚Äù, ‚ÄúCut the Grass‚Äù, ‚ÄúMission Creep‚Äù and ‚ÄúLoon Calls‚Äù.12
We Were Evergreen ‚Äî Towards
Produced by Charlie Andrew, who is alt-J‚Äôs regular, Towards is a sophisticated debut album from French band We Were Evergreen. Highlights are ‚ÄúCargo Cult‚Äù, ‚ÄúBelong‚Äù, the amazing jazzy ‚ÄúEighteen‚Äù and ‚ÄúDaughters‚Äù.11
Thumpers‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäGalore
Most of this album is percussive, incredibly catchy indie pop, but although they have their signature elements, the songs are very variated, from sample-heavy (‚ÄúSound of Screams‚Äù) over epic (‚ÄúUnkinder‚Äù) and emotional (‚ÄúNow We Are Sixteen‚Äù) to euphoric (‚ÄúTogether Now‚Äù) and this is the perfect summer album, which is stupid to say at this point, but it‚Äôs soundtracked part of mine.10
Zammuto ‚Äî Anchor
Formerly from the Books and supported by Gotye, Nick Zammuto‚Äôs band‚Äôs second album is not one to overlook at all. His percussion- and synth- driven experimental music is something to get used to, but once you do that, you‚Äôll keep enjoying it. Highlights are ‚ÄúGreat Equator‚Äù, ‚ÄúHegemony‚Äù, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Be a Tool‚Äù and ‚ÄúSinker‚Äù.9
Oscar and the Wolf‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäEntity
I remember seeing this band play at a local festival, when they had only released two EPs. I liked them, but the style was a little too dreamy for me to really love them. But I‚Äôve been following the band, and as soon as Princes came out, I knew that they‚Äôd changed, but for the better. The electro-heavy indie pop sound of this debut is amazing and Max Colombie‚Äôs voice fits perfectly with it, which is hearable in highlights like ‚ÄúStrange Entity‚Äù, ‚ÄúAstri√π‚Äù, ‚ÄúUndress‚Äù, ‚ÄúNora‚Äù and ‚ÄúKiller You‚Äù. A great debut.8
Foster the People‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäSupermodel
Foster the People‚Äôs debut was good, but not amazing. The album didn‚Äôt sound very organic or cohesive and the dance influence was sometimes a bit too much for my liking. But Supermodel‚Äôs lead single ‚ÄúComing of Age‚Äù proved everyone who thought of this band as just good at one thing completely wrong, and other tracks like ‚ÄúTabloid Super Junkie‚Äù, ‚ÄúPseudologia Fantastica‚Äù and ‚ÄúNevermind‚Äù are as different as it can be. This is Foster the People at their highest level.7
Aphex Twin ‚Äî Syro
Richard James is still the king of intelligent dance music after more than ten years of absence as Aphex Twin, his most popular alias, and that says something. Syro is his most accessible album to date, but it‚Äôs one of his best and the album takes you on a journey exclusive to James‚Äô music. Highlights are the 2nd, 6th and last two tracks.6
Bombay Bicycle Club‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäSo Long, See You Tomorrow
The journeys of lead singer Jack Steadman have had a clear influence on the new Bombay Bicycle album, but it‚Äôs probably their most innovative and eclectic record yet. The experimentation on banger ‚ÄúCarry Me‚Äù and the lighter ballad ‚ÄúHome By Now‚Äù shine, as well as the slow build of the closer title track. Mercury Prize-nominated, and a must-listen.5
The War on Drugs‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäLost in the Dream
Somehow I only stumbled upon this after multiple sites named this the best album of 2014, but they have a reason to. It‚Äôs a gorgeously crafted album that somehow comes up with something new every few seconds, and it gets better with every single listen, with so much buried in the mix that you‚Äôll hear something new everytime. Everything‚Äôs a highlight, this works best if listened to as a whole.4
Temples‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäSun Structures
An amazing debut from this energetic British psychedelic rock band. There‚Äôs a great flow through it and the songs are all different, which makes for an exceptional listen. The guitars and synths take a place up there with the vocals, and the album is full of epic solos and instrumentals. ‚ÄúSand Dance‚Äù, ‚ÄúSun Structures‚Äù, ‚ÄúA Question Isn‚Äôt Answered‚Äù, ‚ÄúMove With the Season‚Äù and essential B-side ‚ÄúAnkh‚Äù are a must-listen.3
alt-J‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäThis Is All Yours
An Awesome Wave won the Mercury Prize and alt-J were suddenly given quite a lot of attention, so compared to the long period in which An Awesome Wave was made, This Is All Yours was quite rushed, but it‚Äôs definitely as good. Maybe not better, but a worthy second album. If you ignore the existence of the big mistake ‚ÄúLeft Hand Free‚Äù, this album is perfect. From the genius vocal experiment-driven ‚ÄúIntro‚Äù and the unexpectedly light and jazzy ‚ÄúArrival In Nara‚Äù over the classic alt-J ‚ÄúEvery Other Freckle‚Äù and inventive ‚ÄúHunger of the Pine‚Äù to the beautiful ‚ÄúBloodflood Pt. II‚Äù, alt-J never fail to make this enjoyable.2
Recorders ‚Äî Above the Tide
To be honest, I wasn‚Äôt even looking forward to this album. I heard Beach on the radio, the track piqued my interest and I Shazamed it, only to be left with ‚Äúno match‚Äù and I had to search for it myself. Luckily I found it on the channel‚Äôs website and I added Beach to my favourites, read somewhere that their album was due for the autumn, followed them on Spotify, and then completely forgot about it. When at school on the release day, I connected to the teachers‚Äô WiFi network (muhahahahah) and got a notification that said that Above the Tide was released, so I downloaded the thing and went walking to get lunch with the record playing, and I was amazed by how good it was. Colorimetric‚Äôs bass line blew my mind completely, as did the overall feel in the album from start to finish. For a few weeks this was literally the only thing I listened to, until alt-J‚Äôs This Is All Yours came out, then it was both. The weird thing is that after overplaying the album like I do so often, I‚Äôm still not tired of it, unlike a few other albums that were great when they came out but lost their excitingness after I kept listening to them. And that is an achievement itself. Highlights include ‚ÄúWolf Drums‚Äù, ‚ÄúColorimetric‚Äù, ‚ÄúAlone In Reykjavik‚Äù, ‚ÄúDive‚Äù, ‚Äú85 MPH‚Äù and everything else.1
East India Youth‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäTotal Strife Forever
When the Mercury Prize nominees were announced, this was one of the underdogs, as the press complained about how much small artists there were in the list. Damon Albarn and Bombay Bicycle Club were some of the only established artists in this and these small artists no one had heard of weren‚Äôt that exciting for everyone, looking for bigger names like Kasabian and Coldplay who were all not invited to the party. But is that necessarily a bad thing? No, it isn‚Äôt. Some of these could never have won, like GoGo Penguin‚Äôs aforementioned v2.0, which is a great album but not comparable to the others and for whom a Mercury Prize nomination is simply a boost for a talented artist, not really giving a chance to win. But out of the whole list of Mercury nominees, the description of this one caught my eye, and I‚Äôm quite thankful for that. William Doyle is extremely good at using loads of different styles but creating something using them that is exciting and different but still alike, and you‚Äôre not alienated when after the accessible pop of ‚ÄúDripping Down‚Äù you‚Äôre presented with the acid techno track ‚ÄúHinterland‚Äù, only to be taken away by the euphoric krautrock track ‚ÄúHeaven, How Long‚Äù, which then continues into the ambient ‚ÄúTotal Strife Forever II‚Äù, you get the idea. This works best as a whole album, although ‚ÄúHeaven, How Long‚Äù, ‚ÄúTotal Strife Forever I‚Äù, ‚ÄúDripping Down‚Äù, ‚ÄúSong for a Granular Piano‚Äù and ‚ÄúLooking for Someone‚Äù stand out. Must-listen for this year, and no doubt my favourite album of 2014.
So, that wraps up my favourite albums list, what are yours? Are there any we both have or are your favourites completely different? Let me know if you want, and have a great 2015!1Embed",en,LABEL_0,0.5729804635047913,LABEL_1,0.42701953649520874

In his blue gardens men and girls came and went like moths among the whisperings and the champagne and the stars. At high tide in the afternoon I watched his guests diving from the tower of his raft, or taking the sun on the hot sand of his beach while his two motor-boats slit the waters of the Sound, drawing aquaplanes over cataracts of foam. On week-ends his Rolls-Royce became an omnibus, bearing parties to and from the city between nine in the morning and long past midnight, while his station wagon scampered like a brisk yellow bug to meet all trains. And on Mondays eight servants, including an extra gardener, toiled all day with mops and scrubbing-brushes and hammers and garden-shears, repairing the ravages of the night before.
Every Friday five crates of oranges and lemons arrived from a fruiterer in New York ‚Äî every Monday these same oranges and lemons left his back door in a pyramid of pulpless halves. There was a machine in the kitchen which could extract the juice of two hundred oranges in half an hour if a little button was pressed two hundred times by a butler‚Äôs thumb.
At least once a fortnight a corps of caterers came down with several hundred feet of canvas and enough colored lights to make a Christmas tree of Gatsby‚Äôs enormous garden. On buffet tables, garnished with glistening hors-d‚Äôoeuvre, spiced baked hams crowded against salads of harlequin designs and pastry pigs and turkeys bewitched to a dark gold. In the main hall a bar with a real brass rail was set up, and stocked with gins and liquors and with cordials so long forgotten that most of his female guests were too young to know one from another.
By seven o‚Äôclock the orchestra has arrived, no thin five-piece affair, but a whole pitful of oboes and trombones and saxophones and viols and cornets and piccolos, and low and high drums. The last swimmers have come in from the beach now and are dressing up-stairs; the cars from New York are parked five deep in the drive, and already the halls and salons and verandas are gaudy with primary colors, and hair shorn in strange new ways, and shawls beyond the dreams of Castile. The bar is in full swing, and floating rounds of cocktails permeate the garden outside, until the air is alive with chatter and laughter, and casual innuendo and introductions forgotten on the spot, and enthusiastic meetings between women who never knew each other‚Äôs names.
The lights grow brighter as the earth lurches away from the sun, and now the orchestra is playing yellow cocktail music, and the opera of voices pitches a key higher. Laughter is easier minute by minute, spilled with prodigality, tipped out at a cheerful word. The groups change more swiftly, swell with new arrivals, dissolve and form in the same breath; already there are wanderers, confident girls who weave here and there among the stouter and more stable, become for a sharp, joyous moment the centre of a group, and then, excited with triumph, glide on through the sea-change of faces and voices and color under the constantly changing light.
Suddenly one of the gypsies, in trembling opal, seizes a cocktail out of the air, dumps it down for courage and, moving her hands like Frisco, dances out alone on the canvas platform. A momentary hush; the orchestra leader varies his rhythm obligingly for her, and there is a burst of chatter as the erroneous news goes around that she is Gilda Gray‚Äôs understudy from the Follies. The party has begun.
I believe that on the first night I went to Gatsby‚Äôs house I was one of the few guests who had actually been invited. People were not invited ‚Äî they went there. They got into automobiles which bore them out to Long Island, and somehow they ended up at Gatsby‚Äôs door. Once there they were introduced by somebody who knew Gatsby, and after that they conducted themselves according to the rules of behavior associated with amusement parks. Sometimes they came and went without having met Gatsby at all, came for the party with a simplicity of heart that was its own ticket of admission.
I had been actually invited. A chauffeur in a uniform of robin‚Äôs-egg blue crossed my lawn early that Saturday morning with a surprisingly formal note from his employer: the honor would be entirely Gatsby‚Äôs, it said, if I would attend his ‚Äúlittle party‚Äù that night. He had seen me several times, and had intended to call on me long before, but a peculiar combination of circumstances had prevented it ‚Äî signed Jay Gatsby, in a majestic hand.
Dressed up in white flannels I went over to his lawn a little after seven, and wandered around rather ill at ease among swirls and eddies of people I didn‚Äôt know‚Äîthough here and there was a face I had noticed on the commuting train. I was immediately struck by the number of young Englishmen dotted about; all well dressed, all looking a little hungry, and all talking in low, earnest voices to solid and prosperous Americans. I was sure that they were selling something: bonds or insurance or automobiles. They were at least agonizingly aware of the easy money in the vicinity and convinced that it was theirs for a few words in the right key.
As soon as I arrived I made an attempt to find my host, but the two or three people of whom I asked his whereabouts stared at me in such an amazed way, and denied so vehemently any knowledge of his movements, that I slunk off in the direction of the cocktail table‚Äîthe only place in the garden where a single man could linger without looking purposeless and alone.
I was on my way to get roaring drunk from sheer embarrassment when Jordan Baker came out of the house and stood at the head of the marble steps, leaning a little backward and looking with contemptuous interest down into the garden.
Welcome or not, I found it necessary to attach myself to some one before I should begin to address cordial remarks to the passers-by.
‚ÄúHello!‚Äù I roared, advancing toward her. My voice seemed unnaturally loud across the garden.
‚ÄúI thought you might be here,‚Äù she responded absently as I came up. ‚ÄúI remembered you lived next door to‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù She held my hand impersonally, as a promise that she‚Äôd take care of me in a minute, and gave ear to two girls in twin yellow dresses, who stopped at the foot of the steps.
‚ÄúHello!‚Äù they cried together. ‚ÄúSorry you didn‚Äôt win.‚Äù
That was for the golf tournament. She had lost in the finals the week before.
‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know who we are,‚Äù said one of the girls in yellow, ‚Äúbut we met you here about a month ago.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou‚Äôve dyed your hair since then,‚Äù remarked Jordan, and I started, but the girls had moved casually on and her remark was addressed to the premature moon, produced like the supper, no doubt, out of a caterer‚Äôs basket. With Jordan‚Äôs slender golden arm resting in mine, we descended the steps and sauntered about the garden. A tray of cocktails floated at us through the twilight, and we sat down at a table with the two girls in yellow and three men, each one introduced to us as Mr. Mumble.
‚ÄúDo you come to these parties often?‚Äù inquired Jordan of the girl beside her.
‚ÄúThe last one was the one I met you at,‚Äù answered the girl, in an alert confident voice. She turned to her companion: ‚ÄúWasn‚Äôt it for you, Lucille?‚Äù
It was for Lucille, too.
‚ÄúI like to come,‚Äù Lucille said. ‚ÄúI never care what I do, so I always have a good time. When I was here last I tore my gown on a chair, and he asked me my name and address‚Äîinside of a week I got a package from Croirier‚Äôs with a new evening gown in it.‚Äù
‚ÄúDid you keep it?‚Äù asked Jordan.
‚ÄúSure I did. I was going to wear it to-night, but it was too big in the bust and had to be altered. It was gas blue with lavender beads. Two hundred and sixty-five dollars.‚Äù
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs something funny about a fellow that‚Äôll do a thing like that,‚Äù said the other girl eagerly. ‚ÄúHe doesn‚Äôt want any trouble with ANYbody.‚Äù
‚ÄúWho doesn‚Äôt?‚Äù I inquired.
‚ÄúGatsby. Somebody told me‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù
The two girls and Jordan leaned together confidentially.
‚ÄúSomebody told me they thought he killed a man once.‚Äù
A thrill passed over all of us. The three Mr. Mumbles bent forward and listened eagerly.
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs so much THAT,‚Äù argued Lucille sceptically; ‚Äúit‚Äôs more that he was a German spy during the war.‚Äù
One of the men nodded in confirmation.
‚ÄúI heard that from a man who knew all about him, grew up with him in Germany,‚Äù he assured us positively.
‚ÄúOh, no,‚Äù said the first girl, ‚Äúit couldn‚Äôt be that, because he was in the American army during the war.‚Äù As our credulity switched back to her she leaned forward with enthusiasm. ‚ÄúYou look at him sometimes when he thinks nobody‚Äôs looking at him. I‚Äôll bet he killed a man.‚Äù
She narrowed her eyes and shivered. Lucille shivered. We all turned and looked around for Gatsby. It was testimony to the romantic speculation he inspired that there were whispers about him from those who found little that it was necessary to whisper about in this world.
The first supper‚Äîthere would be another one after midnight‚Äîwas now being served, and Jordan invited me to join her own party, who were spread around a table on the other side of the garden. There were three married couples and Jordan‚Äôs escort, a persistent undergraduate given to violent innuendo, and obviously under the impression that sooner or later Jordan was going to yield him up her person to a greater or lesser degree. Instead of rambling, this party had preserved a dignified homogeneity, and assumed to itself the function of representing the staid nobility of the country-side‚ÄîEast Egg condescending to West Egg, and carefully on guard against its spectroscopic gayety.
‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get out,‚Äù whispered Jordan, after a somehow wasteful and inappropriate half-hour. ‚ÄúThis is much too polite for me.‚Äù
We got up, and she explained that we were going to find the host: I had never met him, she said, and it was making me uneasy. The undergraduate nodded in a cynical, melancholy way.
The bar, where we glanced first, was crowded, but Gatsby was not there. She couldn‚Äôt find him from the top of the steps, and he wasn‚Äôt on the veranda. On a chance we tried an important-looking door, and walked into a high Gothic library, panelled with carved English oak, and probably transported complete from some ruin overseas
A stout, middle-aged man, with enormous owl-eyed spectacles, was sitting somewhat drunk on the edge of a great table, staring with unsteady concentration at the shelves of books. As we entered he wheeled excitedly around and examined Jordan from head to foot
‚ÄúWhat do you think?‚Äù he demanded impetuously
‚ÄúAbout what?‚Äù He waved his hand toward the book-shelves
‚ÄúAbout that. As a matter of fact you needn‚Äôt bother to ascertain. I ascertained. They‚Äôre real.‚Äù
‚ÄúThe books?‚Äù
He nodded
‚ÄúAbsolutely real ‚Äî have pages and everything. I thought they‚Äôd be a nice durable cardboard. Matter of fact, they‚Äôre absolutely real. Pages and ‚Äî Here! Lemme show you.‚Äù
Taking our scepticism for granted, he rushed to the bookcases and returned with Volume One of the ‚ÄúStoddard Lectures.‚Äù
‚ÄúSee!‚Äù he cried triumphantly. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a bona-fide piece of printed matter. It fooled me. This fella‚Äôs a regular Belasco. It‚Äôs a triumph. What thoroughness! What realism! Knew when to stop, too ‚Äî didn‚Äôt cut the pages. But what do you want? What do you expect?‚Äù
He snatched the book from me and replaced it hastily on its shelf, muttering that if one brick was removed the whole library was liable to collapse
‚ÄúWho brought you?‚Äù he demanded. ‚ÄúOr did you just come? I was brought. Most people were brought.‚Äù
Jordan looked at him alertly, cheerfully, without answering
‚ÄúI was brought by a woman named Roosevelt,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúMrs. Claud Roosevelt. Do you know her? I met her somewhere last night. I‚Äôve been drunk for about a week now, and I thought it might sober me up to sit in a library.‚Äù
‚ÄúHas it?‚Äù
‚ÄúA little bit, I think. I can‚Äôt tell yet. I‚Äôve only been here an hour. Did I tell you about the books? They‚Äôre real. They‚Äôre ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù
‚ÄúYou told us.‚Äù We shook hands with him gravely and went back outdoors.
There was dancing now on the canvas in the garden; old men pushing young girls backward in eternal graceless circles, superior couples holding each other tortuously, fashionably, and keeping in the corners‚Äîand a great number of single girls dancing individualistically or relieving the orchestra for a moment of the burden of the banjo or the traps. By midnight the hilarity had increased. A celebrated tenor had sung in Italian, and a notorious contralto had sung in jazz, and between the numbers people were doing ‚Äústunts.‚Äù all over the garden, while happy, vacuous bursts of laughter rose toward the summer sky. A pair of stage twins, who turned out to be the girls in yellow, did a baby act in costume, and champagne was served in glasses bigger than finger-bowls. The moon had risen higher, and floating in the Sound was a triangle of silver scales, trembling a little to the stiff, tinny drip of the banjoes on the lawn.
I was still with Jordan Baker. We were sitting at a table with a man of about my age and a rowdy little girl, who gave way upon the slightest provocation to uncontrollable laughter. I was enjoying myself now. I had taken two finger-bowls of champagne, and the scene had changed before my eyes into something significant, elemental, and profound.
At a lull in the entertainment the man looked at me and smiled.
‚ÄúYour face is familiar,‚Äù he said, politely. ‚ÄúWeren‚Äôt you in the Third Division during the war?‚Äù
‚ÄúWhy, yes. I was in the Ninth Machine-gun Battalion.‚Äù
‚ÄúI was in the Seventh Infantry until June nineteen-eighteen. I knew I‚Äôd seen you somewhere before.‚Äù
We talked for a moment about some wet, gray little villages in France. Evidently he lived in this vicinity, for he told me that he had just bought a hydroplane, and was going to try it out in the morning.
‚ÄúWant to go with me, old sport? Just near the shore along the Sound.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat time?‚Äù
‚ÄúAny time that suits you best.‚Äù
It was on the tip of my tongue to ask his name when Jordan looked around and smiled.
‚ÄúHaving a gay time now?‚Äù she inquired.
‚ÄúMuch better.‚Äù I turned again to my new acquaintance. ‚ÄúThis is an unusual party for me. I haven‚Äôt even seen the host. I live over there‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù I waved my hand at the invisible hedge in the distance, ‚Äúand this man Gatsby sent over his chauffeur with an invitation.‚Äù For a moment he looked at me as if he failed to understand.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm Gatsby,‚Äù he said suddenly.
‚ÄúWhat!‚Äù I exclaimed. ‚ÄúOh, I beg your pardon.‚Äù
‚ÄúI thought you knew, old sport. I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôm not a very good host.‚Äù
He smiled understandingly‚Äîmuch more than understandingly. It was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you may come across four or five times in life. It faced‚Äîor seemed to face‚Äîthe whole external world for an instant, and then concentrated on you with an irresistible prejudice in your favor. It understood you just so far as you wanted to be understood, believed in you as you would like to believe in yourself, and assured you that it had precisely the impression of you that, at your best, you hoped to convey. Precisely at that point it vanished‚Äîand I was looking at an elegant young rough-neck, a year or two over thirty, whose elaborate formality of speech just missed being absurd. Some time before he introduced himself I‚Äôd got a strong impression that he was picking his words with care.
Almost at the moment when Mr. Gatsby identified himself, a butler hurried toward him with the information that Chicago was calling him on the wire. He excused himself with a small bow that included each of us in turn.
‚ÄúIf you want anything just ask for it, old sport,‚Äù he urged me. ‚ÄúExcuse me. I will rejoin you later.‚Äù
When he was gone I turned immediately to Jordan‚Äîconstrained to assure her of my surprise. I had expected that Mr. Gatsby would be a florid and corpulent person in his middle years.
‚ÄúWho is he?‚Äù I demanded.
‚ÄúDo you know?‚Äù
‚ÄúHe‚Äôs just a man named Gatsby.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhere is he from, I mean? And what does he do?‚Äù
‚ÄúNow YOU‚ÄôRE started on the subject,‚Äù she answered with a wan smile. ‚ÄúWell, he told me once he was an Oxford man.‚Äù A dim background started to take shape behind him, but at her next remark it faded away.
‚ÄúHowever, I don‚Äôt believe it.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù she insisted, ‚ÄúI just don‚Äôt think he went there.‚Äù
Something in her tone reminded me of the other girl‚Äôs ‚ÄúI think he killed a man,‚Äù and had the effect of stimulating my curiosity. I would have accepted without question the information that Gatsby sprang from the swamps of Louisiana or from the lower East Side of New York. That was comprehensible. But young men didn‚Äôt‚Äîat least in my provincial inexperience I believed they didn‚Äôt‚Äîdrift coolly out of nowhere and buy a palace on Long Island Sound.
‚ÄúAnyhow, he gives large parties,‚Äù said Jordan, changing the subject with an urbane distaste for the concrete. ‚ÄúAnd I like large parties. They‚Äôre so intimate. At small parties there isn‚Äôt any privacy.‚Äù
There was the boom of a bass drum, and the voice of the orchestra leader rang out suddenly above the echolalia of the garden.
‚ÄúLadies and gentlemen,‚Äù he cried. ‚ÄúAt the request of Mr. Gatsby we are going to play for you Mr. Vladimir Tostoff‚Äôs latest work, which attracted so much attention at Carnegie Hall last May. If you read the papers, you know there was a big sensation.‚Äù He smiled with jovial condescension, and added: ‚ÄúSome sensation!‚Äù Whereupon everybody laughed.
‚ÄúThe piece is known,‚Äù he concluded lustily, ‚Äúas Vladimir Tostoff‚Äôs JAZZ HISTORY OF THE WORLD.‚Äù
The nature of Mr. Tostoff‚Äôs composition eluded me, because just as it began my eyes fell on Gatsby, standing alone on the marble steps and looking from one group to another with approving eyes. His tanned skin was drawn attractively tight on his face and his short hair looked as though it were trimmed every day. I could see nothing sinister about him. I wondered if the fact that he was not drinking helped to set him off from his guests, for it seemed to me that he grew more correct as the fraternal hilarity increased. When the JAZZ HISTORY OF THE WORLD was over, girls were putting their heads on men‚Äôs shoulders in a puppyish, convivial way, girls were swooning backward playfully into men‚Äôs arms, even into groups, knowing that some one would arrest their falls‚Äîbut no one swooned backward on Gatsby, and no French bob touched Gatsby‚Äôs shoulder, and no singing quartets were formed with Gatsby‚Äôs head for one link.
‚ÄúI beg your pardon.‚Äù
Gatsby‚Äôs butler was suddenly standing beside us.
‚ÄúMiss Baker?‚Äù he inquired. ‚ÄúI beg your pardon, but Mr. Gatsby would like to speak to you alone.‚Äù
‚ÄúWith me?‚Äù she exclaimed in surprise.
‚ÄúYes, madame.‚Äù
She got up slowly, raising her eyebrows at me in astonishment, and followed the butler toward the house. I noticed that she wore her evening-dress, all her dresses, like sports clothes‚Äîthere was a jauntiness about her movements as if she had first learned to walk upon golf courses on clean, crisp mornings.
I was alone and it was almost two. For some time confused and intriguing sounds had issued from a long, many-windowed room which overhung the terrace. Eluding Jordan‚Äôs undergraduate, who was now engaged in an obstetrical conversation with two chorus girls, and who implored me to join him, I went inside.
The large room was full of people. One of the girls in yellow was playing the piano, and beside her stood a tall, red-haired young lady from a famous chorus, engaged in song. She had drunk a quantity of champagne, and during the course of her song she had decided, ineptly, that everything was very, very sad‚Äîshe was not only singing, she was weeping too. Whenever there was a pause in the song she filled it with gasping, broken sobs, and then took up the lyric again in a quavering soprano. The tears coursed down her cheeks‚Äînot freely, however, for when they came into contact with her heavily beaded eyelashes they assumed an inky color, and pursued the rest of their way in slow black rivulets. A humorous suggestion was made that she sing the notes on her face, whereupon she threw up her hands, sank into a chair, and went off into a deep vinous sleep.
‚ÄúShe had a fight with a man who says he‚Äôs her husband,‚Äù explained a girl at my elbow.
I looked around. Most of the remaining women were now having fights with men said to be their husbands. Even Jordan‚Äôs party, the quartet from East Egg, were rent asunder by dissension. One of the men was talking with curious intensity to a young actress, and his wife, after attempting to laugh at the situation in a dignified and indifferent way, broke down entirely and resorted to flank attacks‚Äîat intervals she appeared suddenly at his side like an angry diamond, and hissed: ‚ÄúYou promised!‚Äù into his ear.
The reluctance to go home was not confined to wayward men. The hall was at present occupied by two deplorably sober men and their highly indignant wives. The wives were sympathizing with each other in slightly raised voices.
‚ÄúWhenever he sees I‚Äôm having a good time he wants to go home.‚Äù
‚ÄúNever heard anything so selfish in my life.‚Äù
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre always the first ones to leave.‚Äù
‚ÄúSo are we.‚Äù
‚ÄúWell, we‚Äôre almost the last to-night,‚Äù said one of the men sheepishly. ‚ÄúThe orchestra left half an hour ago.‚Äù
In spite of the wives‚Äô agreement that such malevolence was beyond credibility, the dispute ended in a short struggle, and both wives were lifted, kicking, into the night.
As I waited for my hat in the hall the door of the library opened and Jordan Baker and Gatsby came out together. He was saying some last word to her, but the eagerness in his manner tightened abruptly into formality as several people approached him to say good-bye.
Jordan‚Äôs party were calling impatiently to her from the porch, but she lingered for a moment to shake hands.
‚ÄúI‚Äôve just heard the most amazing thing,‚Äù she whispered. ‚ÄúHow long were we in there?‚Äù
‚ÄúWhy, about an hour.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt was‚Äîsimply amazing,‚Äù she repeated abstractedly. ‚ÄúBut I swore I wouldn‚Äôt tell it and here I am tantalizing you.‚Äù She yawned gracefully in my face: ‚ÄúPlease come and see me. . . . Phone book . . . Under the name of Mrs. Sigourney Howard . . . My aunt . . .‚Äù She was hurrying off as she talked‚Äîher brown hand waved a jaunty salute as she melted into her party at the door.
Rather ashamed that on my first appearance I had stayed so late, I joined the last of Gatsby‚Äôs guests, who were clustered around him. I wanted to explain that I‚Äôd hunted for him early in the evening and to apologize for not having known him in the garden.
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt mention it,‚Äù he enjoined me eagerly. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt give it another thought, old sport.‚Äù The familiar expression held no more familiarity than the hand which reassuringly brushed my shoulder. ‚ÄúAnd don‚Äôt forget we‚Äôre going up in the hydroplane to-morrow morning, at nine o‚Äôclock.‚Äù
Then the butler, behind his shoulder: ‚ÄúPhiladelphia wants you on the ‚Äòphone, sir.‚Äù
‚ÄúAll right, in a minute. Tell them I‚Äôll be right there. . . . good night.‚Äù
‚ÄúGood night.‚Äù
‚ÄúGood night.‚Äù He smiled‚Äîand suddenly there seemed to be a pleasant significance in having been among the last to go, as if he had desired it all the time. ‚ÄúGood night, old sport. . . . good night.‚Äù
But as I walked down the steps I saw that the evening was not quite over. Fifty feet from the door a dozen headlights illuminated a bizarre and tumultuous scene. In the ditch beside the road, right side up, but violently shorn of one wheel, rested a new coupe which had left Gatsby‚Äôs drive not two minutes before. The sharp jut of a wall accounted for the detachment of the wheel, which was now getting considerable attention from half a dozen curious chauffeurs. However, as they had left their cars blocking the road, a harsh, discordant din from those in the rear had been audible for some time, and added to the already violent confusion of the scene.
A man in a long duster had dismounted from the wreck and now stood in the middle of the road, looking from the car to the tire and from the tire to the observers in a pleasant, puzzled way.
‚ÄúSee!‚Äù he explained. ‚ÄúIt went in the ditch.‚Äù
The fact was infinitely astonishing to him, and I recognized first the unusual quality of wonder, and then the man‚Äîit was the late patron of Gatsby‚Äôs library.
‚ÄúHow‚Äôd it happen?‚Äù
He shrugged his shoulders.
‚ÄúI know nothing whatever about mechanics,‚Äù he said decisively.
‚ÄúBut how did it happen? Did you run into the wall?‚Äù ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt ask me,‚Äù said Owl Eyes, washing his hands of the whole matter. ‚ÄúI know very little about driving‚Äînext to nothing. It happened, and that‚Äôs all I know.‚Äù
‚ÄúWell, if you‚Äôre a poor driver you oughtn‚Äôt to try driving at night.‚Äù
‚ÄúBut I wasn‚Äôt even trying,‚Äù he explained indignantly, ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt even trying.‚Äù
An awed hush fell upon the bystanders.
‚ÄúDo you want to commit suicide?‚Äù
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre lucky it was just a wheel! A bad driver and not even TRYing!‚Äù
‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt understand,‚Äù explained the criminal. ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt driving. There‚Äôs another man in the car.‚Äù
The shock that followed this declaration found voice in a sustained ‚ÄúAh-h-h!‚Äù as the door of the coupe swung slowly open. The crowd‚Äîit was now a crowd‚Äîstepped back involuntarily, and when the door had opened wide there was a ghostly pause. Then, very gradually, part by part, a pale, dangling individual stepped out of the wreck, pawing tentatively at the ground with a large uncertain dancing shoe.
Blinded by the glare of the headlights and confused by the incessant groaning of the horns, the apparition stood swaying for a moment before he perceived the man in the duster.
‚ÄúWha‚Äôs matter?‚Äù he inquired calmly. ‚ÄúDid we run outa gas?‚Äù
‚ÄúLook!‚Äù
Half a dozen fingers pointed at the amputated wheel‚Äîhe stared at it for a moment, and then looked upward as though he suspected that it had dropped from the sky.
‚ÄúIt came off,‚Äù some one explained.
He nodded.
‚ÄúAt first I din‚Äô notice we‚Äôd stopped.‚Äù
A pause. Then, taking a long breath and straightening his shoulders, he remarked in a determined voice:
‚ÄúWonder‚Äôff tell me where there‚Äôs a gas‚Äôline station?‚Äù
At least a dozen men, some of them little better off than he was, explained to him that wheel and car were no longer joined by any physical bond.
‚ÄúBack out,‚Äù he suggested after a moment. ‚ÄúPut her in reverse.‚Äù
‚ÄúBut the WHEEL‚ÄôS off!‚Äù
He hesitated.
‚ÄúNo harm in trying,‚Äù he said.
The caterwauling horns had reached a crescendo and I turned away and cut across the lawn toward home. I glanced back once. A wafer of a moon was shining over Gatsby‚Äôs house, making the night fine as before, and surviving the laughter and the sound of his still glowing garden. A sudden emptiness seemed to flow now from the windows and the great doors, endowing with complete isolation the figure of the host, who stood on the porch, his hand up in a formal gesture of farewell.
Reading over what I have written so far, I see I have given the impression that the events of three nights several weeks apart were all that absorbed me. On the contrary, they were merely casual events in a crowded summer, and, until much later, they absorbed me infinitely less than my personal affairs.
Most of the time I worked. In the early morning the sun threw my shadow westward as I hurried down the white chasms of lower New York to the Probity Trust. I knew the other clerks and young bond-salesmen by their first names, and lunched with them in dark, crowded restaurants on little pig sausages and mashed potatoes and coffee. I even had a short affair with a girl who lived in Jersey City and worked in the accounting department, but her brother began throwing mean looks in my direction, so when she went on her vacation in July I let it blow quietly away.
I took dinner usually at the Yale Club‚Äîfor some reason it was the gloomiest event of my day‚Äîand then I went up-stairs to the library and studied investments and securities for a conscientious hour. There were generally a few rioters around, but they never came into the library, so it was a good place to work. After that, if the night was mellow, I strolled down Madison Avenue past the old Murray Hill Hotel, and over 33rd Street to the Pennsylvania Station.
I began to like New York, the racy, adventurous feel of it at night, and the satisfaction that the constant flicker of men and women and machines gives to the restless eye. I liked to walk up Fifth Avenue and pick out romantic women from the crowd and imagine that in a few minutes I was going to enter into their lives, and no one would ever know or disapprove. Sometimes, in my mind, I followed them to their apartments on the corners of hidden streets, and they turned and smiled back at me before they faded through a door into warm darkness. At the enchanted metropolitan twilight I felt a haunting loneliness sometimes, and felt it in others‚Äîpoor young clerks who loitered in front of windows waiting until it was time for a solitary restaurant dinner‚Äîyoung clerks in the dusk, wasting the most poignant moments of night and life.
Again at eight o‚Äôclock, when the dark lanes of the Forties were five deep with throbbing taxi-cabs, bound for the theatre district, I felt a sinking in my heart. Forms leaned together in the taxis as they waited, and voices sang, and there was laughter from unheard jokes, and lighted cigarettes outlined unintelligible gestures inside. Imagining that I, too, was hurrying toward gayety and sharing their intimate excitement, I wished them well.
For a while I lost sight of Jordan Baker, and then in midsummer I found her again. At first I was flattered to go places with her, because she was a golf champion, and every one knew her name. Then it was something more. I wasn‚Äôt actually in love, but I felt a sort of tender curiosity. The bored haughty face that she turned to the world concealed something‚Äîmost affectations conceal something eventually, even though they don‚Äôt in the beginning‚Äîand one day I found what it was. When we were on a house-party together up in Warwick, she left a borrowed car out in the rain with the top down, and then lied about it‚Äîand suddenly I remembered the story about her that had eluded me that night at Daisy‚Äôs. At her first big golf tournament there was a row that nearly reached the newspapers‚Äîa suggestion that she had moved her ball from a bad lie in the semi-final round. The thing approached the proportions of a scandal‚Äîthen died away. A caddy retracted his statement, and the only other witness admitted that he might have been mistaken. The incident and the name had remained together in my mind.
Jordan Baker instinctively avoided clever, shrewd men, and now I saw that this was because she felt safer on a plane where any divergence from a code would be thought impossible. She was incurably dishonest. She wasn‚Äôt able to endure being at a disadvantage and, given this unwillingness, I suppose she had begun dealing in subterfuges when she was very young in order to keep that cool, insolent smile turned to the world and yet satisfy the demands of her hard, jaunty body.
It made no difference to me. Dishonesty in a woman is a thing you never blame deeply‚ÄîI was casually sorry, and then I forgot. It was on that same house party that we had a curious conversation about driving a car. It started because she passed so close to some workmen that our fender flicked a button on one man‚Äôs coat.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a rotten driver,‚Äù I protested. ‚ÄúEither you ought to be more careful, or you oughtn‚Äôt to drive at all.‚Äù
‚ÄúI am careful.‚Äù
‚ÄúNo, you‚Äôre not.‚Äù
‚ÄúWell, other people are,‚Äù she said lightly.
‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that got to do with it?‚Äù
‚ÄúThey‚Äôll keep out of my way,‚Äù she insisted. ‚ÄúIt takes two to make an accident.‚Äù
‚ÄúSuppose you met somebody just as careless as yourself.‚Äù
‚ÄúI hope I never will,‚Äù she answered. ‚ÄúI hate careless people. That‚Äôs why I like you.‚Äù
Her gray, sun-strained eyes stared straight ahead, but she had deliberately shifted our relations, and for a moment I thought I loved her. But I am slow-thinking and full of interior rules that act as brakes on my desires, and I knew that first I had to get myself definitely out of that tangle back home. I‚Äôd been writing letters once a week and signing them: ‚ÄúLove, Nick,‚Äù and all I could think of was how, when that certain girl played tennis, a faint mustache of perspiration appeared on her upper lip. Nevertheless there was a vague understanding that had to be tactfully broken off before I was free.
Every one suspects himself of at least one of the cardinal virtues, and this is mine: I am one of the few honest people that I have ever known.31Embed",en,LABEL_0,0.5362704992294312,LABEL_1,0.46372947096824646

One of these is the sensibility -- unmistakably modern, a variant of sophistication but hardly identical with it -- that goes by the cult name of ""Camp.""
A sensibility (as distinct from an idea) is one of the hardest things to talk about; but there are special reasons why Camp, in particular, has never been discussed. It is not a natural mode of sensibility, if there be any such. Indeed the essence of Camp is its love of the unnatural: of artifice and exaggeration. And Camp is esoteric -- something of a private code, a badge of identity even, among small urban cliques. Apart from a lazy two-page sketch in Christopher Isherwood's novel The World in the Evening (1954), it has hardly broken into print. To talk about Camp is therefore to betray it. If the betrayal can be defended, it will be for the edification it provides, or the dignity of the conflict it resolves. For myself, I plead the goal of self-edification, and the goad of a sharp conflict in my own sensibility. I am strongly drawn to Camp, and almost as strongly offended by it. That is why I want to talk about it, and why I can. For no one who wholeheartedly shares in a given sensibility can analyze it; he can only, whatever his intention, exhibit it. To name a sensibility, to draw its contours and to recount its history, requires a deep sympathy modified by revulsion.
Though I am speaking about sensibility only -- and about a sensibility that, among other things, converts the serious into the frivolous -- these are grave matters. Most people think of sensibility or taste as the realm of purely subjective preferences, those mysterious attractions, mainly sensual, that have not been brought under the sovereignty of reason. They allow that considerations of taste play a part in their reactions to people and to works of art. But this attitude is na√Øve. And even worse. To patronize the faculty of taste is to patronize oneself. For taste governs every free -- as opposed to rote -- human response. Nothing is more decisive. There is taste in people, visual taste, taste in emotion - and there is taste in acts, taste in morality. Intelligence, as well, is really a kind of taste: taste in ideas. (One of the facts to be reckoned with is that taste tends to develop very unevenly. It‚Äôs rare that the same person has good visual taste and good taste in people and taste in ideas.)
Taste has no system and no proofs. But there is something like a logic of taste: the consistent sensibility which underlies and gives rise to a certain taste. A sensibility is almost, but not quite, ineffable. Any sensibility which can be crammed into the mold of a system, or handled with the rough tools of proof, is no longer a sensibility at all. It has hardened into an idea . . .
To snare a sensibility in words, especially one that is alive and powerful,1 one must be tentative and nimble. The form of jottings, rather than an essay (with its claim to a linear, consecutive argument), seemed more appropriate for getting down something of this particular fugitive sensibility. It's embarrassing to be solemn and treatise-like about Camp. One runs the risk of having, oneself, produced a very inferior piece of Camp.
These notes are for Oscar Wilde.

- Phrases & Philosophies for the Use of the Young
1. To start very generally: Camp is a certain mode of aestheticism. It is one way of seeing the world as an aesthetic phenomenon. That way, the way of Camp, is not in terms of beauty, but in terms of the degree of artifice, of stylization.
2. To emphasize style is to slight content, or to introduce an attitude which is neutral with respect to content. It goes without saying that the Camp sensibility is disengaged, depoliticized -- or at least apolitical.
3. Not only is there a Camp vision, a Camp way of looking at things. Camp is as well a quality discoverable in objects and the behavior of persons. There are ""campy"" movies, clothes, furniture, popular songs, novels, people, buildings. . . . This distinction is important. True, the Camp eye has the power to transform experience. But not everything can be seen as Camp. It's not all in the eye of the beholder.
4. Random examples of items which are part of the canon of Camp:
Zuleika Dobson
Tiffany lamps
Scopitone films
The Brown Derby restaurant on Sunset Boulevard in LA
The Enquirer, headlines and stories
Aubrey Beardsley drawings
Swan Lake
Bellini‚Äôs operas
Visconti's direction of Salome and 'Tis Pity She's a Whore
certain turn-of-the-century picture postcards
Schoedsack's King Kong
the Cuban pop singer La Lupe
Lynn Ward's novel in woodcuts, God's Man
the old Flash Gordon comics
women's clothes of the twenties (feather boas, fringed and beaded dresses, etc.)
the novels of Ronald Firbank and Ivy Compton-Burnett
stag movies seen without lust
5. Camp taste has an affinity for certain arts rather than others. Clothes, furniture, all the elements of visual d√©cor, for instance, make up a large part of Camp. For Camp art is often decorative art, emphasizing texture, sensuous surface, and style at the expense of content. Concert music, though, because it is contentless, is rarely Camp. It offers no opportunity, say, for a contrast between silly or extravagant content and rich form. . . . Sometimes whole art forms become saturated with Camp. Classical ballet, opera, movies have seemed so for a long time. In the last two years, popular music (post rock-‚Äôn‚Äô-roll, what the French call y√© y√©) has been annexed. And movie criticism (like lists of ""The 10 Best Bad Movies I Have Seen"") is probably the greatest popularizer of Camp taste today, because most people still go to the movies in a high-spirited and unpretentious way.
6. There is a sense in which it is correct to say: ""It's too good to be Camp."" Or ""too important,"" not marginal enough. (More on this later.) Thus, the personality and many of the works of Jean Cocteau are Camp, but not those of Andr√© Gide; the operas of Richard Strauss, but not those of Wagner; concoctions of Tin Pan Alley and Liverpool, but not jazz. Many examples of Camp are things which, from a ""serious"" point of view, are either bad art or kitsch. Not all, though. Not only is Camp not necessarily bad art, but some art which can be approached as Camp (example: the major films of Louis Feuillade) merits the most serious admiration and study.
""The more we study Art, the less we care for Nature.""
- The Decay of Lying
7. All Camp objects, and persons, contain a large element of artifice. Nothing in nature can be campy . . . Rural Camp is still man-made, and most campy objects are urban. (Yet, they often have a serenity -- or a naivet√© -- which is the equivalent of pastoral. A great deal of Camp suggests Empson‚Äôs phrase, ""urban pastoral."")
8. Camp is a vision of the world in terms of style -- but a particular kind of style. It is the love of the exaggerated, the ""off,"" of things-being-what-they-are-not. The best example is in Art Nouveau, the most typical and fully developed Camp style. Art Nouveau objects, typically, convert one thing into something else: the lighting fixtures in the form of flowering plants, the living room which is really a grotto. A remarkable example: the Paris M√©tro entrances designed by Hector Guimard in the late 1890s in the shape of cast-iron orchid stalks.
9. As a taste in persons, Camp responds particularly to the markedly attenuated and to the strongly exaggerated. The androgyne is certainly one of the great images of Camp sensibility. Examples: the swooning, slim, sinuous figures of pre-Raphaelite painting and poetry; the thin, flowing, sexless bodies in Art Nouveau prints and posters, presented in relief on lamps and ashtrays; the haunting androgynous vacancy behind the perfect beauty of Greta Garbo. Here, Camp taste draws on a mostly unacknowledged truth of taste: the most refined form of sexual attractiveness (as well as the most refined form of sexual pleasure) consists in going against the grain of one's sex. What is most beautiful in virile men is something feminine; what is most beautiful in feminine women is something masculine. . . . Allied to the Camp taste for the androgynous is something that seems quite different but isn't: a relish for the exaggeration of sexual characteristics and personality mannerisms. For obvious reasons, the best examples that can be cited are movie stars. The corny flamboyant female-ness of Jayne Mansfield, Gina Lollobrigida, Jane Russell, Virginia Mayo; the exaggerated he-man-ness of Steve Reeves, Victor Mature. The great stylists of temperament and mannerism, like Bette Davis, Barbara Stanwyck, Tallulah Bankhead, Edwige Feuilli√®re.
10. Camp sees everything in quotation marks. It's not a lamp, but a ""lamp""; not a woman, but a ""woman."" To perceive Camp in objects and persons is to understand Being-as-Playing-a-Role. It is the farthest extension, in sensibility, of the metaphor of life as theater.
11. Camp is the triumph of the epicene style. (The convertibility of ""man"" and ""woman,"" ""person"" and ""thing."") But all style, that is, artifice, is, ultimately, epicene. Life is not stylish. Neither is nature.
12. The question isn‚Äôt, ""Why travesty, impersonation, theatricality?"" The question is, rather, ""When does travesty, impersonation, theatricality acquire the special flavor of Camp?"" Why is the atmosphere of Shakespeare's comedies (As You Like It, etc.) not epicene, while that of Der Rosenkavalier is?
13. The dividing line seems to fall in the 18th century; there the origins of Camp taste are to be found (Gothic novels, Chinoiserie, caricature, artificial ruins, and so forth.) But the relation to nature was quite different then. In the 18th century, people of taste either patronized nature (Strawberry Hill) or attempted to remake it into something artificial (Versailles). They also indefatigably patronized the past. Today's Camp taste effaces nature, or else contradicts it outright. And the relation of Camp taste to the past is extremely sentimental.
14. A pocket history of Camp might, of course, begin farther back -- with the mannerist artists like Pontormo, Rosso, and Caravaggio, or the extraordinarily theatrical painting of Georges de La Tour, or Euphuism (Lyly, etc.) in literature. Still, the soundest starting point seems to be the late 17th and early 18th century, because of that period's extraordinary feeling for artifice, for surface, for symmetry; its taste for the picturesque and the thrilling, its elegant conventions for representing instant feeling and the total presence of character -- the epigram and the rhymed couplet (in words), the flourish (in gesture and in music). The late 17th and early 18th century is the great period of Camp: Pope, Congreve, Walpole, etc, but not Swift; les pr√©cieux in France; the rococo churches of Munich; Pergolesi. Somewhat later: much of Mozart. But in the 19th century, what had been distributed throughout all of high culture now becomes a special taste; it takes on overtones of the acute, the esoteric, the perverse. Confining the story to England alone, we see Camp continuing wanly through 19th century aestheticism (Bume-Jones, Pater, Ruskin, Tennyson), emerging full-blown with the Art Nouveau movement in the visual and decorative arts, and finding its conscious ideologists in such ""wits"" as Wilde and Firbank.
15. Of course, to say all these things are Camp is not to argue they are simply that. A full analysis of Art Nouveau, for instance, would scarcely equate it with Camp. But such an analysis cannot ignore what in Art Nouveau allows it to be experienced as Camp. Art Nouveau is full of ""content,"" even of a political-moral sort; it was a revolutionary movement in the arts, spurred on by a Utopian vision (somewhere between William Morris and the Bauhaus group) of an organic politics and taste. Yet there is also a feature of the Art Nouveau objects which suggests a disengaged, unserious, ""aesthete's"" vision. This tells us something important about Art Nouveau -- and about what the lens of Camp, which blocks out content, is.
16. Thus, the Camp sensibility is one that is alive to a double sense in which some things can be taken. But this is not the familiar split-level construction of a literal meaning, on the one hand, and a symbolic meaning, on the other. It is the difference, rather, between the thing as meaning something, anything, and the thing as pure artifice.
17. This comes out clearly in the vulgar use of the word Camp as a verb, ""to camp,"" something that people do. To camp is a mode of seduction -- one which employs flamboyant mannerisms susceptible of a double interpretation; gestures full of duplicity, with a witty meaning for cognoscenti and another, more impersonal, for outsiders. Equally and by extension, when the word becomes a noun, when a person or a thing is ""a camp,"" a duplicity is involved. Behind the ""straight"" public sense in which something can be taken, one has found a private zany experience of the thing.
""To be natural is such a very difficult pose to keep up.""
- An Ideal Husband
18. One must distinguish between na√Øve and deliberate Camp. Pure Camp is always naive. Camp which knows itself to be Camp (""camping"") is usually less satisfying.
19. The pure examples of Camp are unintentional; they are dead serious. The Art Nouveau craftsman who makes a lamp with a snake coiled around it is not kidding, nor is he trying to be charming. He is saying, in all earnestness: Voil√†! the Orient! Genuine Camp -- for instance, the numbers devised for the Warner Brothers musicals of the early thirties (42nd Street; The Golddiggers of 1933; ... of 1935; ... of 1937; etc.) by Busby Berkeley -- does not mean to be funny. Camping -- say, the plays of Noel Coward -- does. It seems unlikely that much of the traditional opera repertoire could be such satisfying Camp if the melodramatic absurdities of most opera plots had not been taken seriously by their composers. One doesn't need to know the artist's private intentions. The work tells all. (Compare a typical 19th century opera with Samuel Barber's Vanessa, a piece of manufactured, calculated Camp, and the difference is clear.)
20. Probably, intending to be campy is always harmful. The perfection of Trouble in Paradise and The Maltese Falcon, among the greatest Camp movies ever made, comes from the effortless smooth way in which tone is maintained. This is not so with such famous would-be Camp films of the fifties as All About Eve and Beat the Devil. These more recent movies have their fine moments, but the first is so slick and the second so hysterical; they want so badly to be campy that they're continually losing the beat. . . . Perhaps, though, it is not so much a question of the unintended effect versus the conscious intention, as of the delicate relation between parody and self-parody in Camp. The films of Hitchcock are a showcase for this problem. When self-parody lacks ebullience but instead reveals (even sporadically) a contempt for one's themes and one's materials - as in To Catch a Thief, Rear Window, North by Northwest -- the results are forced and heavy-handed, rarely Camp. Successful Camp -- a movie like Carn√©'s Dr√¥le de Drame; the film performances of Mae West and Edward Everett Horton; portions of the Goon Show -- even when it reveals self-parody, reeks of self-love.
21. So, again, Camp rests on innocence. That means Camp discloses innocence, but also, when it can, corrupts it. Objects, being objects, don't change when they are singled out by the Camp vision. Persons, however, respond to their audiences. Persons begin ""camping"": Mae West, Bea Lillie, La Lupe, Tallulah Bankhead in Lifeboat, Bette Davis in All About Eve. (Persons can even be induced to camp without their knowing it. Consider the way Fellini got Anita Ekberg to parody herself in La Dolce Vita.)
22. Considered a little less strictly, Camp is either completely naive or else wholly conscious (when one plays at being campy). An example of the latter: Wilde's epigrams themselves.
""It's absurd to divide people into good and bad. People are either charming or tedious.""
- Lady Windemere's Fan
23. In na√Øve, or pure, Camp, the essential element is seriousness, a seriousness that fails. Of course, not all seriousness that fails can be redeemed as Camp. Only that which has the proper mixture of the exaggerated, the fantastic, the passionate, and the na√Øve.
24. When something is just bad (rather than Camp), it's often because it is too mediocre in its ambition. The artist hasn't attempted to do anything really outlandish. (""It's too much,"" ""It's too fantastic,"" ""It's not to be believed,"" are standard phrases of Camp enthusiasm.)
25. The hallmark of Camp is the spirit of extravagance. Camp is a woman walking around in a dress made of three million feathers. Camp is the paintings of Carlo Crivelli, with their real jewels and trompe-l'oeil insects and cracks in the masonry. Camp is the outrageous aestheticism of Steinberg's six American movies with Dietrich, all six, but especially the last, The Devil Is a Woman. . . . In Camp there is often something d√©mesur√© in the quality of the ambition, not only in the style of the work itself. Gaud√≠'s lurid and beautiful buildings in Barcelona are Camp not only because of their style but because they reveal -- most notably in the Cathedral of the Sagrada Familia -- the ambition on the part of one man to do what it takes a generation, a whole culture to accomplish.
26. Camp is art that proposes itself seriously, but cannot be taken altogether seriously because it is ""too much."" Titus Andronicus and Strange Interlude are almost Camp, or could be played as Camp. The public manner and rhetoric of de Gaulle, often, are pure Camp.
27. A work can come close to Camp, but not make it, because it succeeds. Eisenstein's films are seldom Camp because, despite all exaggeration, they do succeed (dramatically) without surplus. If they were a little more ""off,"" they could be great Camp - particularly Ivan the Terrible I & II. The same for Blake's drawings and paintings, weird and mannered as they are. They aren't Camp; though Art Nouveau, influenced by Blake, is.
What is extravagant in an inconsistent or an unpassionate way is not Camp. Neither can anything be Camp that does not seem to spring from an irrepressible, a virtually uncontrolled sensibility. Without passion, one gets pseudo-Camp -- what is merely decorative, safe, in a word, chic. On the barren edge of Camp lie a number of attractive things: the sleek fantasies of Dali, the haute couture preciosity of Albicocco's The Girl with the Golden Eyes. But the two things - Camp and preciosity - must not be confused.
28. Again, Camp is the attempt to do something extraordinary. But extraordinary in the sense, often, of being special, glamorous. (The curved line, the extravagant gesture.) Not extraordinary merely in the sense of effort. Ripley's Believe-It-Or-Not items are rarely campy. These items, either natural oddities (the two-headed rooster, the eggplant in the shape of a cross) or else the products of immense labor (the man who walked from here to China on his hands, the woman who engraved the New Testament on the head of a pin), lack the visual reward - the glamour, the theatricality - that marks off certain extravagances as Camp.
29. The reason a movie like On the Beach, books like Winesburg, Ohio and For Whom the Bell Tolls are bad to the point of being laughable, but not bad to the point of being enjoyable, is that they are too dogged and pretentious. They lack fantasy. There is Camp in such bad movies as The Prodigal and Samson and Delilah, the series of Italian color spectacles featuring the super-hero Maciste, numerous Japanese science fiction films (Rodan, The Mysterians, The H-Man) because, in their relative unpretentiousness and vulgarity, they are more extreme and irresponsible in their fantasy - and therefore touching and quite enjoyable.
30. Of course, the canon of Camp can change. Time has a great deal to do with it. Time may enhance what seems simply dogged or lacking in fantasy now because we are too close to it, because it resembles too closely our own everyday fantasies, the fantastic nature of which we don't perceive. We are better able to enjoy a fantasy as fantasy when it is not our own.
31. This is why so many of the objects prized by Camp taste are old-fashioned, out-of-date, d√©mod√©. It's not a love of the old as such. It's simply that the process of aging or deterioration provides the necessary detachment -- or arouses a necessary sympathy. When the theme is important, and contemporary, the failure of a work of art may make us indignant. Time can change that. Time liberates the work of art from moral relevance, delivering it over to the Camp sensibility. . . . Another effect: time contracts the sphere of banality. (Banality is, strictly speaking, always a category of the contemporary.) What was banal can, with the passage of time, become fantastic. Many people who listen with delight to the style of Rudy Vallee revived by the English pop group, The Temperance Seven, would have been driven up the wall by Rudy Vallee in his heyday.
Thus, things are campy, not when they become old - but when we become less involved in them, and can enjoy, instead of be frustrated by, the failure of the attempt. But the effect of time is unpredictable. Maybe Method acting (James Dean, Rod Steiger, Warren Beatty) will seem as Camp some day as Ruby Keeler's does now - or as Sarah Bernhardt's does, in the films she made at the end of her career. And maybe not.
32. Camp is the glorification of ""character."" The statement is of no importance - except, of course, to the person (Loie Fuller, Gaud√≠, Cecil B. De Mille, Crivelli, de Gaulle, etc.) who makes it. What the Camp eye appreciates is the unity, the force of the person. In every move the aging Martha Graham makes she's being Martha Graham, etc., etc. . . . This is clear in the case of the great serious idol of Camp taste, Greta Garbo. Garbo's incompetence (at the least, lack of depth) as an actress enhances her beauty. She's always herself.
33. What Camp taste responds to is ""instant character"" (this is, of course, very 18th century); and, conversely, what it is not stirred by is the sense of the development of character. Character is understood as a state of continual incandescence - a person being one, very intense thing. This attitude toward character is a key element of the theatricalization of experience embodied in the Camp sensibility. And it helps account for the fact that opera and ballet are experienced as such rich treasures of Camp, for neither of these forms can easily do justice to the complexity of human nature. Wherever there is development of character, Camp is reduced. Among operas, for example, La Traviata (which has some small development of character) is less campy than Il Trovatore (which has none).

34. Camp taste turns its back on the good-bad axis of ordinary aesthetic judgment. Camp doesn't reverse things. It doesn't argue that the good is bad, or the bad is good. What it does is to offer for art (and life) a different -- a supplementary -- set of standards.
35. Ordinarily we value a work of art because of the seriousness and dignity of what it achieves. We value it because it succeeds - in being what it is and, presumably, in fulfilling the intention that lies behind it. We assume a proper, that is to say, straightforward relation between intention and performance. By such standards, we appraise The Iliad, Aristophanes' plays, The Art of the Fugue, Middlemarch, the paintings of Rembrandt, Chartres, the poetry of Donne, The Divine Comedy, Beethoven's quartets, and - among people - Socrates, Jesus, St. Francis, Napoleon, Savonarola. In short, the pantheon of high culture: truth, beauty, and seriousness.
36. But there are other creative sensibilities besides the seriousness (both tragic and comic) of high culture and of the high style of evaluating people. And one cheats oneself, as a human being, if one has respect only for the style of high culture, whatever else one may do or feel on the sly.
For instance, there is the kind of seriousness whose trademark is anguish, cruelty, derangement. Here we do accept a disparity between intention and result. I am speaking, obviously, of a style of personal existence as well as of a style in art; but the examples had best come from art. Think of Bosch, Sade, Rimbaud, Jarry, Kafka, Artaud, think of most of the important works of art of the 20th century, that is, art whose goal is not that of creating harmonies but of overstraining the medium and introducing more and more violent, and unresolvable, subject-matter. This sensibility also insists on the principle that an oeuvre in the old sense (again, in art, but also in life) is not possible. Only ""fragments"" are possible. . . . Clearly, different standards apply here than to traditional high culture. Something is good not because it is achieved, but because another kind of truth about the human situation, another experience of what it is to be human - in short, another valid sensibility -- is being revealed.
And third among the great creative sensibilities is Camp: the sensibility of failed seriousness, of the theatricalization of experience. Camp refuses both the harmonies of traditional seriousness, and the risks of fully identifying with extreme states of feeling.
37. The first sensibility, that of high culture, is basically moralistic. The second sensibility, that of extreme states of feeling, represented in much contemporary ""avant-garde"" art, gains power by a tension between moral and aesthetic passion. The third, Camp, is wholly aesthetic.
38. Camp is the consistently aesthetic experience of the world. It incarnates a victory of ""style"" over ""content,"" ""aesthetics"" over ""morality,"" of irony over tragedy.
39. Camp and tragedy are antitheses. There is seriousness in Camp (seriousness in the degree of the artist's involvement) and, often, pathos. The excruciating is also one of the tonalities of Camp; it is the quality of excruciation in much of Henry James (for instance, The Europeans, The Awkward Age, The Wings of the Dove) that is responsible for the large element of Camp in his writings. But there is never, never tragedy.
40. Style is everything. Genet's ideas, for instance, are very Camp. Genet's statement that ""the only criterion of an act is its elegance""2 is virtually interchangeable, as a statement, with Wilde's ""in matters of great importance, the vital element is not sincerity, but style."" But what counts, finally, is the style in which ideas are held. The ideas about morality and politics in, say, Lady Windemere's Fan and in Major Barbara are Camp, but not just because of the nature of the ideas themselves. It is those ideas, held in a special playful way. The Camp ideas in Our Lady of the Flowers are maintained too grimly, and the writing itself is too successfully elevated and serious, for Genet's books to be Camp.
41. The whole point of Camp is to dethrone the serious. Camp is playful, anti-serious. More precisely, Camp involves a new, more complex relation to ""the serious."" One can be serious about the frivolous, frivolous about the serious.
42. One is drawn to Camp when one realizes that ""sincerity"" is not enough. Sincerity can be simple philistinism, intellectual narrowness.
43. The traditional means for going beyond straight seriousness - irony, satire - seem feeble today, inadequate to the culturally oversaturated medium in which contemporary sensibility is schooled. Camp introduces a new standard: artifice as an ideal, theatricality.
44. Camp proposes a comic vision of the world. But not a bitter or polemical comedy. If tragedy is an experience of hyperinvolvement, comedy is an experience of underinvolvement, of detachment.

45. Detachment is the prerogative of an elite; and as the dandy is the 19th century's surrogate for the aristocrat in matters of culture, so Camp is the modern dandyism. Camp is the answer to the problem: how to be a dandy in the age of mass culture.
46. The dandy was overbred. His posture was disdain, or else ennui. He sought rare sensations, undefiled by mass appreciation. (Models: Des Esseintes in Huysmans' √Ä Rebours, Marius the Epicurean, Val√©ry's Monsieur Teste.) He was dedicated to ""good taste.""
The connoisseur of Camp has found more ingenious pleasures. Not in Latin poetry and rare wines and velvet jackets, but in the coarsest, commonest pleasures, in the arts of the masses. Mere use does not defile the objects of his pleasure, since he learns to possess them in a rare way. Camp -- Dandyism in the age of mass culture -- makes no distinction between the unique object and the mass-produced object. Camp taste transcends the nausea of the replica.
47. Wilde himself is a transitional figure. The man who, when he first came to London, sported a velvet beret, lace shirts, velveteen knee-breeches and black silk stockings, could never depart too far in his life from the pleasures of the old-style dandy; this conservatism is reflected in The Picture of Dorian Gray. But many of his attitudes suggest something more modern. It was Wilde who formulated an important element of the Camp sensibility -- the equivalence of all objects -- when he announced his intention of ""living up"" to his blue-and-white china, or declared that a doorknob could be as admirable as a painting. When he proclaimed the importance of the necktie, the boutonniere, the chair, Wilde was anticipating the democratic esprit of Camp.
48. The old-style dandy hated vulgarity. The new-style dandy, the lover of Camp, appreciates vulgarity. Where the dandy would be continually offended or bored, the connoisseur of Camp is continually amused, delighted. The dandy held a perfumed handkerchief to his nostrils and was liable to swoon; the connoisseur of Camp sniffs the stink and prides himself on his strong nerves.
49. It is a feat, of course. A feat goaded on, in the last analysis, by the threat of boredom. The relation between boredom and Camp taste cannot be overestimated. Camp taste is by its nature possible only in affluent societies, in societies or circles capable of experiencing the psychopathology of affluence.

50. Aristocracy is a position vis-√†-vis culture (as well as vis-√†-vis power), and the history of Camp taste is part of the history of snob taste. But since no authentic aristocrats in the old sense exist today to sponsor special tastes, who is the bearer of this taste? Answer: an improvised self-elected class, mainly homosexuals, who constitute themselves as aristocrats of taste.
51. The peculiar relation between Camp taste and homosexuality has to be explained. While it's not true that Camp taste is homosexual taste, there is no doubt a peculiar affinity and overlap. Not all liberals are Jews, but Jews have shown a peculiar affinity for liberal and reformist causes. So, not all homosexuals have Camp taste. But homosexuals, by and large, constitute the vanguard -- and the most articulate audience -- of Camp. (The analogy is not frivolously chosen. Jews and homosexuals are the outstanding creative minorities in contemporary urban culture. Creative, that is, in the truest sense: they are creators of sensibilities. The two pioneering forces of modern sensibility are Jewish moral seriousness and homosexual aestheticism and irony.)
52. The reason for the flourishing of the aristocratic posture among homosexuals also seems to parallel the Jewish case. For every sensibility is self-serving to the group that promotes it. Jewish liberalism is a gesture of self-legitimization. So is Camp taste, which definitely has something propagandistic about it. Needless to say, the propaganda operates in exactly the opposite direction. The Jews pinned their hopes for integrating into modern society on promoting the moral sense. Homosexuals have pinned their integration into society on promoting the aesthetic sense. Camp is a solvent of morality. It neutralizes moral indignation, sponsors playfulness.
53. Nevertheless, even though homosexuals have been its vanguard, Camp taste is much more than homosexual taste. Obviously, its metaphor of life as ",en,LABEL_0,0.5238968729972839,LABEL_1,0.47610312700271606

In his blue gardens men and girls came and went like moths among the whisperings and the champagne and the stars. At high tide in the afternoon I watched his guests diving from the tower of his raft, or taking the sun on the hot sand of his beach while his two motor-boats slit the waters of the Sound, drawing aquaplanes over cataracts of foam. On week-ends his Rolls-Royce became an omnibus, bearing parties to and from the city between nine in the morning and long past midnight, while his station wagon scampered like a brisk yellow bug to meet all trains. And on Mondays eight servants, including an extra gardener, toiled all day with mops and scrubbing-brushes and hammers and garden-shears, repairing the ravages of the night before.
Every Friday five crates of oranges and lemons arrived from a fruiterer in New York ‚Äî every Monday these same oranges and lemons left his back door in a pyramid of pulpless halves. There was a machine in the kitchen which could extract the juice of two hundred oranges in half an hour if a little button was pressed two hundred times by a butler‚Äôs thumb.
At least once a fortnight a corps of caterers came down with several hundred feet of canvas and enough colored lights to make a Christmas tree of Gatsby‚Äôs enormous garden. On buffet tables, garnished with glistening hors-d‚Äôoeuvre, spiced baked hams crowded against salads of harlequin designs and pastry pigs and turkeys bewitched to a dark gold. In the main hall a bar with a real brass rail was set up, and stocked with gins and liquors and with cordials so long forgotten that most of his female guests were too young to know one from another.
By seven o‚Äôclock the orchestra has arrived, no thin five-piece affair, but a whole pitful of oboes and trombones and saxophones and viols and cornets and piccolos, and low and high drums. The last swimmers have come in from the beach now and are dressing up-stairs; the cars from New York are parked five deep in the drive, and already the halls and salons and verandas are gaudy with primary colors, and hair shorn in strange new ways, and shawls beyond the dreams of Castile. The bar is in full swing, and floating rounds of cocktails permeate the garden outside, until the air is alive with chatter and laughter, and casual innuendo and introductions forgotten on the spot, and enthusiastic meetings between women who never knew each other‚Äôs names.
The lights grow brighter as the earth lurches away from the sun, and now the orchestra is playing yellow cocktail music, and the opera of voices pitches a key higher. Laughter is easier minute by minute, spilled with prodigality, tipped out at a cheerful word. The groups change more swiftly, swell with new arrivals, dissolve and form in the same breath; already there are wanderers, confident girls who weave here and there among the stouter and more stable, become for a sharp, joyous moment the centre of a group, and then, excited with triumph, glide on through the sea-change of faces and voices and color under the constantly changing light.
Suddenly one of the gypsies, in trembling opal, seizes a cocktail out of the air, dumps it down for courage and, moving her hands like Frisco, dances out alone on the canvas platform. A momentary hush; the orchestra leader varies his rhythm obligingly for her, and there is a burst of chatter as the erroneous news goes around that she is Gilda Gray‚Äôs understudy from the Follies. The party has begun.
I believe that on the first night I went to Gatsby‚Äôs house I was one of the few guests who had actually been invited. People were not invited ‚Äî they went there. They got into automobiles which bore them out to Long Island, and somehow they ended up at Gatsby‚Äôs door. Once there they were introduced by somebody who knew Gatsby, and after that they conducted themselves according to the rules of behavior associated with amusement parks. Sometimes they came and went without having met Gatsby at all, came for the party with a simplicity of heart that was its own ticket of admission.
I had been actually invited. A chauffeur in a uniform of robin‚Äôs-egg blue crossed my lawn early that Saturday morning with a surprisingly formal note from his employer: the honor would be entirely Gatsby‚Äôs, it said, if I would attend his ‚Äúlittle party‚Äù that night. He had seen me several times, and had intended to call on me long before, but a peculiar combination of circumstances had prevented it ‚Äî signed Jay Gatsby, in a majestic hand.
Dressed up in white flannels I went over to his lawn a little after seven, and wandered around rather ill at ease among swirls and eddies of people I didn‚Äôt know‚Äîthough here and there was a face I had noticed on the commuting train. I was immediately struck by the number of young Englishmen dotted about; all well dressed, all looking a little hungry, and all talking in low, earnest voices to solid and prosperous Americans. I was sure that they were selling something: bonds or insurance or automobiles. They were at least agonizingly aware of the easy money in the vicinity and convinced that it was theirs for a few words in the right key.
As soon as I arrived I made an attempt to find my host, but the two or three people of whom I asked his whereabouts stared at me in such an amazed way, and denied so vehemently any knowledge of his movements, that I slunk off in the direction of the cocktail table‚Äîthe only place in the garden where a single man could linger without looking purposeless and alone.
I was on my way to get roaring drunk from sheer embarrassment when Jordan Baker came out of the house and stood at the head of the marble steps, leaning a little backward and looking with contemptuous interest down into the garden.
Welcome or not, I found it necessary to attach myself to some one before I should begin to address cordial remarks to the passers-by.
‚ÄúHello!‚Äù I roared, advancing toward her. My voice seemed unnaturally loud across the garden.
‚ÄúI thought you might be here,‚Äù she responded absently as I came up. ‚ÄúI remembered you lived next door to‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù She held my hand impersonally, as a promise that she‚Äôd take care of me in a minute, and gave ear to two girls in twin yellow dresses, who stopped at the foot of the steps.
‚ÄúHello!‚Äù they cried together. ‚ÄúSorry you didn‚Äôt win.‚Äù
That was for the golf tournament. She had lost in the finals the week before.
‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know who we are,‚Äù said one of the girls in yellow, ‚Äúbut we met you here about a month ago.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou‚Äôve dyed your hair since then,‚Äù remarked Jordan, and I started, but the girls had moved casually on and her remark was addressed to the premature moon, produced like the supper, no doubt, out of a caterer‚Äôs basket. With Jordan‚Äôs slender golden arm resting in mine, we descended the steps and sauntered about the garden. A tray of cocktails floated at us through the twilight, and we sat down at a table with the two girls in yellow and three men, each one introduced to us as Mr. Mumble.
‚ÄúDo you come to these parties often?‚Äù inquired Jordan of the girl beside her.
‚ÄúThe last one was the one I met you at,‚Äù answered the girl, in an alert confident voice. She turned to her companion: ‚ÄúWasn‚Äôt it for you, Lucille?‚Äù
It was for Lucille, too.
‚ÄúI like to come,‚Äù Lucille said. ‚ÄúI never care what I do, so I always have a good time. When I was here last I tore my gown on a chair, and he asked me my name and address‚Äîinside of a week I got a package from Croirier‚Äôs with a new evening gown in it.‚Äù
‚ÄúDid you keep it?‚Äù asked Jordan.
‚ÄúSure I did. I was going to wear it to-night, but it was too big in the bust and had to be altered. It was gas blue with lavender beads. Two hundred and sixty-five dollars.‚Äù
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs something funny about a fellow that‚Äôll do a thing like that,‚Äù said the other girl eagerly. ‚ÄúHe doesn‚Äôt want any trouble with ANYbody.‚Äù
‚ÄúWho doesn‚Äôt?‚Äù I inquired.
‚ÄúGatsby. Somebody told me‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù
The two girls and Jordan leaned together confidentially.
‚ÄúSomebody told me they thought he killed a man once.‚Äù
A thrill passed over all of us. The three Mr. Mumbles bent forward and listened eagerly.
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs so much THAT,‚Äù argued Lucille sceptically; ‚Äúit‚Äôs more that he was a German spy during the war.‚Äù
One of the men nodded in confirmation.
‚ÄúI heard that from a man who knew all about him, grew up with him in Germany,‚Äù he assured us positively.
‚ÄúOh, no,‚Äù said the first girl, ‚Äúit couldn‚Äôt be that, because he was in the American army during the war.‚Äù As our credulity switched back to her she leaned forward with enthusiasm. ‚ÄúYou look at him sometimes when he thinks nobody‚Äôs looking at him. I‚Äôll bet he killed a man.‚Äù
She narrowed her eyes and shivered. Lucille shivered. We all turned and looked around for Gatsby. It was testimony to the romantic speculation he inspired that there were whispers about him from those who found little that it was necessary to whisper about in this world.
The first supper‚Äîthere would be another one after midnight‚Äîwas now being served, and Jordan invited me to join her own party, who were spread around a table on the other side of the garden. There were three married couples and Jordan‚Äôs escort, a persistent undergraduate given to violent innuendo, and obviously under the impression that sooner or later Jordan was going to yield him up her person to a greater or lesser degree. Instead of rambling, this party had preserved a dignified homogeneity, and assumed to itself the function of representing the staid nobility of the country-side‚ÄîEast Egg condescending to West Egg, and carefully on guard against its spectroscopic gayety.
‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get out,‚Äù whispered Jordan, after a somehow wasteful and inappropriate half-hour. ‚ÄúThis is much too polite for me.‚Äù
We got up, and she explained that we were going to find the host: I had never met him, she said, and it was making me uneasy. The undergraduate nodded in a cynical, melancholy way.
The bar, where we glanced first, was crowded, but Gatsby was not there. She couldn‚Äôt find him from the top of the steps, and he wasn‚Äôt on the veranda. On a chance we tried an important-looking door, and walked into a high Gothic library, panelled with carved English oak, and probably transported complete from some ruin overseas
A stout, middle-aged man, with enormous owl-eyed spectacles, was sitting somewhat drunk on the edge of a great table, staring with unsteady concentration at the shelves of books. As we entered he wheeled excitedly around and examined Jordan from head to foot
‚ÄúWhat do you think?‚Äù he demanded impetuously
‚ÄúAbout what?‚Äù He waved his hand toward the book-shelves
‚ÄúAbout that. As a matter of fact you needn‚Äôt bother to ascertain. I ascertained. They‚Äôre real.‚Äù
‚ÄúThe books?‚Äù
He nodded
‚ÄúAbsolutely real ‚Äî have pages and everything. I thought they‚Äôd be a nice durable cardboard. Matter of fact, they‚Äôre absolutely real. Pages and ‚Äî Here! Lemme show you.‚Äù
Taking our scepticism for granted, he rushed to the bookcases and returned with Volume One of the ‚ÄúStoddard Lectures.‚Äù
‚ÄúSee!‚Äù he cried triumphantly. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a bona-fide piece of printed matter. It fooled me. This fella‚Äôs a regular Belasco. It‚Äôs a triumph. What thoroughness! What realism! Knew when to stop, too ‚Äî didn‚Äôt cut the pages. But what do you want? What do you expect?‚Äù
He snatched the book from me and replaced it hastily on its shelf, muttering that if one brick was removed the whole library was liable to collapse
‚ÄúWho brought you?‚Äù he demanded. ‚ÄúOr did you just come? I was brought. Most people were brought.‚Äù
Jordan looked at him alertly, cheerfully, without answering
‚ÄúI was brought by a woman named Roosevelt,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúMrs. Claud Roosevelt. Do you know her? I met her somewhere last night. I‚Äôve been drunk for about a week now, and I thought it might sober me up to sit in a library.‚Äù
‚ÄúHas it?‚Äù
‚ÄúA little bit, I think. I can‚Äôt tell yet. I‚Äôve only been here an hour. Did I tell you about the books? They‚Äôre real. They‚Äôre ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù
‚ÄúYou told us.‚Äù We shook hands with him gravely and went back outdoors.
There was dancing now on the canvas in the garden; old men pushing young girls backward in eternal graceless circles, superior couples holding each other tortuously, fashionably, and keeping in the corners‚Äîand a great number of single girls dancing individualistically or relieving the orchestra for a moment of the burden of the banjo or the traps. By midnight the hilarity had increased. A celebrated tenor had sung in Italian, and a notorious contralto had sung in jazz, and between the numbers people were doing ‚Äústunts.‚Äù all over the garden, while happy, vacuous bursts of laughter rose toward the summer sky. A pair of stage twins, who turned out to be the girls in yellow, did a baby act in costume, and champagne was served in glasses bigger than finger-bowls. The moon had risen higher, and floating in the Sound was a triangle of silver scales, trembling a little to the stiff, tinny drip of the banjoes on the lawn.
I was still with Jordan Baker. We were sitting at a table with a man of about my age and a rowdy little girl, who gave way upon the slightest provocation to uncontrollable laughter. I was enjoying myself now. I had taken two finger-bowls of champagne, and the scene had changed before my eyes into something significant, elemental, and profound.
At a lull in the entertainment the man looked at me and smiled.
‚ÄúYour face is familiar,‚Äù he said, politely. ‚ÄúWeren‚Äôt you in the Third Division during the war?‚Äù
‚ÄúWhy, yes. I was in the Ninth Machine-gun Battalion.‚Äù
‚ÄúI was in the Seventh Infantry until June nineteen-eighteen. I knew I‚Äôd seen you somewhere before.‚Äù
We talked for a moment about some wet, gray little villages in France. Evidently he lived in this vicinity, for he told me that he had just bought a hydroplane, and was going to try it out in the morning.
‚ÄúWant to go with me, old sport? Just near the shore along the Sound.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat time?‚Äù
‚ÄúAny time that suits you best.‚Äù
It was on the tip of my tongue to ask his name when Jordan looked around and smiled.
‚ÄúHaving a gay time now?‚Äù she inquired.
‚ÄúMuch better.‚Äù I turned again to my new acquaintance. ‚ÄúThis is an unusual party for me. I haven‚Äôt even seen the host. I live over there‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù I waved my hand at the invisible hedge in the distance, ‚Äúand this man Gatsby sent over his chauffeur with an invitation.‚Äù For a moment he looked at me as if he failed to understand.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm Gatsby,‚Äù he said suddenly.
‚ÄúWhat!‚Äù I exclaimed. ‚ÄúOh, I beg your pardon.‚Äù
‚ÄúI thought you knew, old sport. I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôm not a very good host.‚Äù
He smiled understandingly‚Äîmuch more than understandingly. It was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you may come across four or five times in life. It faced‚Äîor seemed to face‚Äîthe whole external world for an instant, and then concentrated on you with an irresistible prejudice in your favor. It understood you just so far as you wanted to be understood, believed in you as you would like to believe in yourself, and assured you that it had precisely the impression of you that, at your best, you hoped to convey. Precisely at that point it vanished‚Äîand I was looking at an elegant young rough-neck, a year or two over thirty, whose elaborate formality of speech just missed being absurd. Some time before he introduced himself I‚Äôd got a strong impression that he was picking his words with care.
Almost at the moment when Mr. Gatsby identified himself, a butler hurried toward him with the information that Chicago was calling him on the wire. He excused himself with a small bow that included each of us in turn.
‚ÄúIf you want anything just ask for it, old sport,‚Äù he urged me. ‚ÄúExcuse me. I will rejoin you later.‚Äù
When he was gone I turned immediately to Jordan‚Äîconstrained to assure her of my surprise. I had expected that Mr. Gatsby would be a florid and corpulent person in his middle years.
‚ÄúWho is he?‚Äù I demanded.
‚ÄúDo you know?‚Äù
‚ÄúHe‚Äôs just a man named Gatsby.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhere is he from, I mean? And what does he do?‚Äù
‚ÄúNow YOU‚ÄôRE started on the subject,‚Äù she answered with a wan smile. ‚ÄúWell, he told me once he was an Oxford man.‚Äù A dim background started to take shape behind him, but at her next remark it faded away.
‚ÄúHowever, I don‚Äôt believe it.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù she insisted, ‚ÄúI just don‚Äôt think he went there.‚Äù
Something in her tone reminded me of the other girl‚Äôs ‚ÄúI think he killed a man,‚Äù and had the effect of stimulating my curiosity. I would have accepted without question the information that Gatsby sprang from the swamps of Louisiana or from the lower East Side of New York. That was comprehensible. But young men didn‚Äôt‚Äîat least in my provincial inexperience I believed they didn‚Äôt‚Äîdrift coolly out of nowhere and buy a palace on Long Island Sound.
‚ÄúAnyhow, he gives large parties,‚Äù said Jordan, changing the subject with an urbane distaste for the concrete. ‚ÄúAnd I like large parties. They‚Äôre so intimate. At small parties there isn‚Äôt any privacy.‚Äù
There was the boom of a bass drum, and the voice of the orchestra leader rang out suddenly above the echolalia of the garden.
‚ÄúLadies and gentlemen,‚Äù he cried. ‚ÄúAt the request of Mr. Gatsby we are going to play for you Mr. Vladimir Tostoff‚Äôs latest work, which attracted so much attention at Carnegie Hall last May. If you read the papers, you know there was a big sensation.‚Äù He smiled with jovial condescension, and added: ‚ÄúSome sensation!‚Äù Whereupon everybody laughed.
‚ÄúThe piece is known,‚Äù he concluded lustily, ‚Äúas Vladimir Tostoff‚Äôs JAZZ HISTORY OF THE WORLD.‚Äù
The nature of Mr. Tostoff‚Äôs composition eluded me, because just as it began my eyes fell on Gatsby, standing alone on the marble steps and looking from one group to another with approving eyes. His tanned skin was drawn attractively tight on his face and his short hair looked as though it were trimmed every day. I could see nothing sinister about him. I wondered if the fact that he was not drinking helped to set him off from his guests, for it seemed to me that he grew more correct as the fraternal hilarity increased. When the JAZZ HISTORY OF THE WORLD was over, girls were putting their heads on men‚Äôs shoulders in a puppyish, convivial way, girls were swooning backward playfully into men‚Äôs arms, even into groups, knowing that some one would arrest their falls‚Äîbut no one swooned backward on Gatsby, and no French bob touched Gatsby‚Äôs shoulder, and no singing quartets were formed with Gatsby‚Äôs head for one link.
‚ÄúI beg your pardon.‚Äù
Gatsby‚Äôs butler was suddenly standing beside us.
‚ÄúMiss Baker?‚Äù he inquired. ‚ÄúI beg your pardon, but Mr. Gatsby would like to speak to you alone.‚Äù
‚ÄúWith me?‚Äù she exclaimed in surprise.
‚ÄúYes, madame.‚Äù
She got up slowly, raising her eyebrows at me in astonishment, and followed the butler toward the house. I noticed that she wore her evening-dress, all her dresses, like sports clothes‚Äîthere was a jauntiness about her movements as if she had first learned to walk upon golf courses on clean, crisp mornings.
I was alone and it was almost two. For some time confused and intriguing sounds had issued from a long, many-windowed room which overhung the terrace. Eluding Jordan‚Äôs undergraduate, who was now engaged in an obstetrical conversation with two chorus girls, and who implored me to join him, I went inside.
The large room was full of people. One of the girls in yellow was playing the piano, and beside her stood a tall, red-haired young lady from a famous chorus, engaged in song. She had drunk a quantity of champagne, and during the course of her song she had decided, ineptly, that everything was very, very sad‚Äîshe was not only singing, she was weeping too. Whenever there was a pause in the song she filled it with gasping, broken sobs, and then took up the lyric again in a quavering soprano. The tears coursed down her cheeks‚Äînot freely, however, for when they came into contact with her heavily beaded eyelashes they assumed an inky color, and pursued the rest of their way in slow black rivulets. A humorous suggestion was made that she sing the notes on her face, whereupon she threw up her hands, sank into a chair, and went off into a deep vinous sleep.
‚ÄúShe had a fight with a man who says he‚Äôs her husband,‚Äù explained a girl at my elbow.
I looked around. Most of the remaining women were now having fights with men said to be their husbands. Even Jordan‚Äôs party, the quartet from East Egg, were rent asunder by dissension. One of the men was talking with curious intensity to a young actress, and his wife, after attempting to laugh at the situation in a dignified and indifferent way, broke down entirely and resorted to flank attacks‚Äîat intervals she appeared suddenly at his side like an angry diamond, and hissed: ‚ÄúYou promised!‚Äù into his ear.
The reluctance to go home was not confined to wayward men. The hall was at present occupied by two deplorably sober men and their highly indignant wives. The wives were sympathizing with each other in slightly raised voices.
‚ÄúWhenever he sees I‚Äôm having a good time he wants to go home.‚Äù
‚ÄúNever heard anything so selfish in my life.‚Äù
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre always the first ones to leave.‚Äù
‚ÄúSo are we.‚Äù
‚ÄúWell, we‚Äôre almost the last to-night,‚Äù said one of the men sheepishly. ‚ÄúThe orchestra left half an hour ago.‚Äù
In spite of the wives‚Äô agreement that such malevolence was beyond credibility, the dispute ended in a short struggle, and both wives were lifted, kicking, into the night.
As I waited for my hat in the hall the door of the library opened and Jordan Baker and Gatsby came out together. He was saying some last word to her, but the eagerness in his manner tightened abruptly into formality as several people approached him to say good-bye.
Jordan‚Äôs party were calling impatiently to her from the porch, but she lingered for a moment to shake hands.
‚ÄúI‚Äôve just heard the most amazing thing,‚Äù she whispered. ‚ÄúHow long were we in there?‚Äù
‚ÄúWhy, about an hour.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt was‚Äîsimply amazing,‚Äù she repeated abstractedly. ‚ÄúBut I swore I wouldn‚Äôt tell it and here I am tantalizing you.‚Äù She yawned gracefully in my face: ‚ÄúPlease come and see me. . . . Phone book . . . Under the name of Mrs. Sigourney Howard . . . My aunt . . .‚Äù She was hurrying off as she talked‚Äîher brown hand waved a jaunty salute as she melted into her party at the door.
Rather ashamed that on my first appearance I had stayed so late, I joined the last of Gatsby‚Äôs guests, who were clustered around him. I wanted to explain that I‚Äôd hunted for him early in the evening and to apologize for not having known him in the garden.
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt mention it,‚Äù he enjoined me eagerly. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt give it another thought, old sport.‚Äù The familiar expression held no more familiarity than the hand which reassuringly brushed my shoulder. ‚ÄúAnd don‚Äôt forget we‚Äôre going up in the hydroplane to-morrow morning, at nine o‚Äôclock.‚Äù
Then the butler, behind his shoulder: ‚ÄúPhiladelphia wants you on the ‚Äòphone, sir.‚Äù
‚ÄúAll right, in a minute. Tell them I‚Äôll be right there. . . . good night.‚Äù
‚ÄúGood night.‚Äù
‚ÄúGood night.‚Äù He smiled‚Äîand suddenly there seemed to be a pleasant significance in having been among the last to go, as if he had desired it all the time. ‚ÄúGood night, old sport. . . . good night.‚Äù
But as I walked down the steps I saw that the evening was not quite over. Fifty feet from the door a dozen headlights illuminated a bizarre and tumultuous scene. In the ditch beside the road, right side up, but violently shorn of one wheel, rested a new coupe which had left Gatsby‚Äôs drive not two minutes before. The sharp jut of a wall accounted for the detachment of the wheel, which was now getting considerable attention from half a dozen curious chauffeurs. However, as they had left their cars blocking the road, a harsh, discordant din from those in the rear had been audible for some time, and added to the already violent confusion of the scene.
A man in a long duster had dismounted from the wreck and now stood in the middle of the road, looking from the car to the tire and from the tire to the observers in a pleasant, puzzled way.
‚ÄúSee!‚Äù he explained. ‚ÄúIt went in the ditch.‚Äù
The fact was infinitely astonishing to him, and I recognized first the unusual quality of wonder, and then the man‚Äîit was the late patron of Gatsby‚Äôs library.
‚ÄúHow‚Äôd it happen?‚Äù
He shrugged his shoulders.
‚ÄúI know nothing whatever about mechanics,‚Äù he said decisively.
‚ÄúBut how did it happen? Did you run into the wall?‚Äù ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt ask me,‚Äù said Owl Eyes, washing his hands of the whole matter. ‚ÄúI know very little about driving‚Äînext to nothing. It happened, and that‚Äôs all I know.‚Äù
‚ÄúWell, if you‚Äôre a poor driver you oughtn‚Äôt to try driving at night.‚Äù
‚ÄúBut I wasn‚Äôt even trying,‚Äù he explained indignantly, ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt even trying.‚Äù
An awed hush fell upon the bystanders.
‚ÄúDo you want to commit suicide?‚Äù
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre lucky it was just a wheel! A bad driver and not even TRYing!‚Äù
‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt understand,‚Äù explained the criminal. ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt driving. There‚Äôs another man in the car.‚Äù
The shock that followed this declaration found voice in a sustained ‚ÄúAh-h-h!‚Äù as the door of the coupe swung slowly open. The crowd‚Äîit was now a crowd‚Äîstepped back involuntarily, and when the door had opened wide there was a ghostly pause. Then, very gradually, part by part, a pale, dangling individual stepped out of the wreck, pawing tentatively at the ground with a large uncertain dancing shoe.
Blinded by the glare of the headlights and confused by the incessant groaning of the horns, the apparition stood swaying for a moment before he perceived the man in the duster.
‚ÄúWha‚Äôs matter?‚Äù he inquired calmly. ‚ÄúDid we run outa gas?‚Äù
‚ÄúLook!‚Äù
Half a dozen fingers pointed at the amputated wheel‚Äîhe stared at it for a moment, and then looked upward as though he suspected that it had dropped from the sky.
‚ÄúIt came off,‚Äù some one explained.
He nodded.
‚ÄúAt first I din‚Äô notice we‚Äôd stopped.‚Äù
A pause. Then, taking a long breath and straightening his shoulders, he remarked in a determined voice:
‚ÄúWonder‚Äôff tell me where there‚Äôs a gas‚Äôline station?‚Äù
At least a dozen men, some of them little better off than he was, explained to him that wheel and car were no longer joined by any physical bond.
‚ÄúBack out,‚Äù he suggested after a moment. ‚ÄúPut her in reverse.‚Äù
‚ÄúBut the WHEEL‚ÄôS off!‚Äù
He hesitated.
‚ÄúNo harm in trying,‚Äù he said.
The caterwauling horns had reached a crescendo and I turned away and cut across the lawn toward home. I glanced back once. A wafer of a moon was shining over Gatsby‚Äôs house, making the night fine as before, and surviving the laughter and the sound of his still glowing garden. A sudden emptiness seemed to flow now from the windows and the great doors, endowing with complete isolation the figure of the host, who stood on the porch, his hand up in a formal gesture of farewell.
Reading over what I have written so far, I see I have given the impression that the events of three nights several weeks apart were all that absorbed me. On the contrary, they were merely casual events in a crowded summer, and, until much later, they absorbed me infinitely less than my personal affairs.
Most of the time I worked. In the early morning the sun threw my shadow westward as I hurried down the white chasms of lower New York to the Probity Trust. I knew the other clerks and young bond-salesmen by their first names, and lunched with them in dark, crowded restaurants on little pig sausages and mashed potatoes and coffee. I even had a short affair with a girl who lived in Jersey City and worked in the accounting department, but her brother began throwing mean looks in my direction, so when she went on her vacation in July I let it blow quietly away.
I took dinner usually at the Yale Club‚Äîfor some reason it was the gloomiest event of my day‚Äîand then I went up-stairs to the library and studied investments and securities for a conscientious hour. There were generally a few rioters around, but they never came into the library, so it was a good place to work. After that, if the night was mellow, I strolled down Madison Avenue past the old Murray Hill Hotel, and over 33rd Street to the Pennsylvania Station.
I began to like New York, the racy, adventurous feel of it at night, and the satisfaction that the constant flicker of men and women and machines gives to the restless eye. I liked to walk up Fifth Avenue and pick out romantic women from the crowd and imagine that in a few minutes I was going to enter into their lives, and no one would ever know or disapprove. Sometimes, in my mind, I followed them to their apartments on the corners of hidden streets, and they turned and smiled back at me before they faded through a door into warm darkness. At the enchanted metropolitan twilight I felt a haunting loneliness sometimes, and felt it in others‚Äîpoor young clerks who loitered in front of windows waiting until it was time for a solitary restaurant dinner‚Äîyoung clerks in the dusk, wasting the most poignant moments of night and life.
Again at eight o‚Äôclock, when the dark lanes of the Forties were five deep with throbbing taxi-cabs, bound for the theatre district, I felt a sinking in my heart. Forms leaned together in the taxis as they waited, and voices sang, and there was laughter from unheard jokes, and lighted cigarettes outlined unintelligible gestures inside. Imagining that I, too, was hurrying toward gayety and sharing their intimate excitement, I wished them well.
For a while I lost sight of Jordan Baker, and then in midsummer I found her again. At first I was flattered to go places with her, because she was a golf champion, and every one knew her name. Then it was something more. I wasn‚Äôt actually in love, but I felt a sort of tender curiosity. The bored haughty face that she turned to the world concealed something‚Äîmost affectations conceal something eventually, even though they don‚Äôt in the beginning‚Äîand one day I found what it was. When we were on a house-party together up in Warwick, she left a borrowed car out in the rain with the top down, and then lied about it‚Äîand suddenly I remembered the story about her that had eluded me that night at Daisy‚Äôs. At her first big golf tournament there was a row that nearly reached the newspapers‚Äîa suggestion that she had moved her ball from a bad lie in the semi-final round. The thing approached the proportions of a scandal‚Äîthen died away. A caddy retracted his statement, and the only other witness admitted that he might have been mistaken. The incident and the name had remained together in my mind.
Jordan Baker instinctively avoided clever, shrewd men, and now I saw that this was because she felt safer on a plane where any divergence from a code would be thought impossible. She was incurably dishonest. She wasn‚Äôt able to endure being at a disadvantage and, given this unwillingness, I suppose she had begun dealing in subterfuges when she was very young in order to keep that cool, insolent smile turned to the world and yet satisfy the demands of her hard, jaunty body.
It made no difference to me. Dishonesty in a woman is a thing you never blame deeply‚ÄîI was casually sorry, and then I forgot. It was on that same house party that we had a curious conversation about driving a car. It started because she passed so close to some workmen that our fender flicked a button on one man‚Äôs coat.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a rotten driver,‚Äù I protested. ‚ÄúEither you ought to be more careful, or you oughtn‚Äôt to drive at all.‚Äù
‚ÄúI am careful.‚Äù
‚ÄúNo, you‚Äôre not.‚Äù
‚ÄúWell, other people are,‚Äù she said lightly.
‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that got to do with it?‚Äù
‚ÄúThey‚Äôll keep out of my way,‚Äù she insisted. ‚ÄúIt takes two to make an accident.‚Äù
‚ÄúSuppose you met somebody just as careless as yourself.‚Äù
‚ÄúI hope I never will,‚Äù she answered. ‚ÄúI hate careless people. That‚Äôs why I like you.‚Äù
Her gray, sun-strained eyes stared straight ahead, but she had deliberately shifted our relations, and for a moment I thought I loved her. But I am slow-thinking and full of interior rules that act as brakes on my desires, and I knew that first I had to get myself definitely out of that tangle back home. I‚Äôd been writing letters once a week and signing them: ‚ÄúLove, Nick,‚Äù and all I could think of was how, when that certain girl played tennis, a faint mustache of perspiration appeared on her upper lip. Nevertheless there was a vague understanding that had to be tactfully broken off before I was free.
Every one suspects himself of at least one of the cardinal virtues, and this is mine: I am one of the few honest people that I have ever known.31Embed",en,LABEL_0,0.5141640901565552,LABEL_1,0.4858359098434448

I found myself dreaming in silver and gold
Like a scene from a movie
That every broken heart knows
We were walking on moonlight
When you pulled me close
Split second and you disappeared
And I was all alone
I woke up in tears
With you by my side
A breath of relief
And I realized
No, we're not promised tomorrow

So I'm gonna love you
Like I'm gonna lose you
I'm gonna hold you
Like I'm saying goodbye
Wherever we're standing
I won't take you for granted
Cause we'll never know when
When we'll run out of time
So I'm gonna love you

In the blink of an eye
Just a whisper of smoke
You could lose everything
The truth is, you never know
So I'll kiss you longer, baby
Any chance that I get
I'll make the most of the minutes
And love with no regret
Let's take our time to say what we want
Use what we got before it's all gone

In Paris and Rome, but I wanna go home, mmm
May be surrounded by a million people, I
Still feel all alone
I just wanna go home

And I've been keeping all the letters that I wrote to you
Each one a line or two
I'm fine, baby, how are you?
Well, I would send them, but I know that it's just not enough
My words were cold and flat
And you deserve more than that
Another aeroplane, another sunny place
I'm lucky, I know, but I wanna go home
Mmm, I got to go home

Let me go home
I'm just too far from where you are
I wanna come home

And I feel just like I'm living someone else's life
It's like I just stepped outside
When everything was going right
And I know just why you could not come along with me
That this was not your dream
But you always believed in me

There are a few people we need to thank tonight for bringing about this grand event. Neil Portnow, Dana Tamarkin, Rob Light, Brian Greenbaum, Don Was. And also want to thank President Carter for coming. It‚Äôs been a long night, and I don‚Äôt want to talk too much, but I‚Äôll say a few things. I'm glad for my songs to be honored like this. But you know, they didn't get here by themselves. It's been a long road and it's taken a lot of doing. These songs of mine, I think of as mystery plays, the kind that Shakespeare saw when he was growing up. I think you could trace what I do back that far. They were on the fringes then, and I think they're on the fringes now. And they sound like they've been traveling on hard ground. I need to mention a few people along the way who brought this about. I know I should mention John Hammond, the great talent scout, who way back when brought me to Columbia Records. He signed me to that label when I was nobody. It took a lot of faith to do that, and he took a lot of ridicule, but he was his own man and he was courageous. And for that, I'm eternally grateful. The last person he discovered before me was Aretha Franklin, and before that Count Basie, Billie Holiday and a whole lot of other artists. All non-commercial artists. Trends did not interest John, and I was very noncommercial but he stayed with me. He believed in my talent and that's all that mattered. I can't thank him enough for that. Lou Levy ran Leeds Music, and they published my earliest songs, but I didn't stay there too long. Levy himself, he went back a long ways. He signed me to that company and recorded my songs and I sang them into a tape recorder. He told me outright, there was no precedent for what I was doing, that I was either before my time or behind it. And if I brought him a song like ""Stardust,"" he'd turn it down because it would be too late. He told me that if I was before my time -- and he didn't really know that for sure -- but if it was happening and if it was true, the public would usually take three to five years to catch up -- so be prepared. And that did happen. The trouble was, when the public did catch up I was already three to five years beyond that, so it kind of complicated it. But he was encouraging, and he didn't judge me, and I'll always remember him for that. Artie Mogull at Witmark Music signed me next to his company, and he told me to just keep writing songs no matter what, that I might be on to something. Well, he too stood behind me, and he could never wait to see what I'd give him next. I didn't even think of myself as a songwriter before then. I'll always be grateful for him also for that attitude.I also have to mention some of the early artists who recorded my songs very, very early, without having to be asked. Just something they felt about them that was right for them. I've got to say thank you to Peter, Paul and Mary, who I knew all separately before they ever became a group. I didn't even think of myself as writing songs for others to sing but it was starting to happen and it couldn't have happened to, or with, a better group. They took a song of mine that had been recorded before that was buried on one of my records and turned it into a hit song. Not the way I would have done it -- they straightened it out. But since then hundreds of people have recorded it and I don't think that would have happened if it wasn't for them. They definitely started something for me. The Byrds, the Turtles, Sonny & Cher -- they made some of my songs Top 10 hits but I wasn't a pop songwriter and I really didn't want to be that, but it was good that it happened. Their versions of my songs were like commercials, but I didn't really mind that because 50 years later my songs were being used in the commercials. So that was good too. I was glad it happened, and I was glad they'd done it. Pervis Staples and the Staple Singers -- long before they were on Stax they were on Epic and they were one of my favorite groups of all time. I met them all in '62 or '63. They heard my songs live and Pervis wanted to record three or four of them and he did with the Staples Singers. They were the type of artists that I wanted recording my songs, if anybody was going to do it. Nina Simone. I used to cross paths with her in New York City in the Village Gate nightclub. She was an artist a definitely looked up to. She recorded some of my songs that she learned directly from me, sitting in a dressing room. She was an overwhelming artist, piano player and singer. Very strong woman, very outspoken and dynamite to see perform. That she was recording my songs validated everything that I was about. Nina was the kind of artist that I loved and admired. Oh, and can't forget Jimi Hendrix. I actually saw Jimi Hendrix perform when he was in a band called Jimmy James and the Blue Flames -- something like that. And Jimi didn't even sing. He was just the guitar player. After he became famous, he took some small songs of mine that nobody paid any attention to and pumped them up into the outer limits of the stratosphere and turned them all into classics. I have to thank Jimi, too. I wish he was here. Johnny Cash recorded some of my songs early on, too, I met him in about '63, when he was all skin and bones. He traveled long, he traveled hard, but he was a hero of mine. I heard many of his songs growing up. I knew them better than I knew my own. ""Big River,"" ""I Walk the Line."" ""How High‚Äôs The Water, Mama?"" I wrote ""It's Alright Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)"" with that song reverberating inside my head. I still ask, ""How high is the water, mama?"" Johnny was an intense character. And he saw that people were putting me down playing electric music, and he posted letters to magazines scolding people, telling them to shut up and let him sing. In Johnny Cash's world -- hardcore Southern drama -- that kind of thing didn't exist. Nobody told anybody what to sing or do. They just didn't do that kind of thing where he came from. I'm always going to thank him for that. Johnny Cash was a giant of a man, the man in black. And I'll always cherish the friendship we had until the day there is no more days. Oh, and I'd be remiss if I didn't mention Joan Baez. She was the queen of folk music then and now. She took a liking to my songs and brought me with her to play concerts, where she had crowds of thousands of people enthralled with her beauty and voice. People would say, ""What are you doing with that ragtag scrubby looking waif?"" And she'd tell everybody in no uncertain terms, ""Now you better be quiet and listen to the songs."" We even played a few of them together. Joan Baez is as tough-minded as they come. Loyal, free minded and fiercely independent. Nobody can tell her what to do if she doesn't want to do it. I learned a lot of things from her. A woman of devastating honesty. And for her kind of love and devotion, I could never pay that back. These songs didn't come out of thin air. I didn't just make them up out of whole cloth. Contrary to what Lou Levy said, there was a precedent. It all came out of traditional music: traditional folk music, traditional rock 'n' roll and traditional big-band swing orchestra music. I learned lyrics and how to write them from listening to folk songs. And I played them, and I met other people that played them, back when nobody was doing it. Sang nothing but these folk songs, and they gave me the code for everything that's fair game, that everything belongs to everyone. For three or four years all I listened to were folk standards. I went to sleep singing folk songs. I sang them everywhere, clubs, parties, bars, coffeehouses, fields, festivals. And I met other singers along the way who did the same thing and we just learned songs from each other. I could learn one song and sing it next in an hour if I'd heard it just once. If you sang ""John Henry"" as many times as me -- ""John Henry was a steel-driving man / Died with a hammer in his hand / John Henry said a man ain't nothin' but a man / Before I let that steam drill drive me down / I'll die with that hammer in my hand.""If you had sung that song as many times as I did, you'd have written ""How many roads must a man walk down?"" too. Big Bill Broonzy had a song called ""Key to the Highway."" ""I've got a key to the highway / I'm booked and I'm bound to go / Gonna leave here runnin' because walking is most too slow."" I sang that a lot. If you sing that a lot, you just might write, Georgia Sam he had a bloody nose Welfare Department they wouldn‚Äôt give him no clothes He asked poor Howard where can I go Howard said there‚Äôs only one place I know Sam said tell me quick man I got to run Howard just pointed with his gun And said that way down on Highway 61 You'd have written that too if you'd sang ""Key to the Highway"" as much as me. ""Ain't no use sit 'n cry / You'll be an angel by and by / Sail away, ladies, sail away."" ""I'm sailing away my own true love."" ""Boots of Spanish Leather"" -- Sheryl Crow just sung that. ""Roll the cotton down, aw, yeah, roll the cotton down / Ten dollars a day is a white man's pay / Roll the cotton down/A dollar a day is the black man's pay / Roll the cotton down."" If you sang that song as many times as me, you'd be writing ""I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more,"" too. If you‚Äôd had listened to the Robert Johnson singing, ‚ÄúBetter come in my kitchen, ‚Äòcause it‚Äôs gonna be raining out doors,‚Äù as many time as I listened to it, sometime later you just might write, ‚ÄúA Hard Rain‚Äôs a-Gonna Fall.‚Äù I sang a lot of ""come all you"" songs. There's plenty of them. There's way too many to be counted. ""Come along boys and listen to my tale / Tell you of my troubles on the old Chisholm Trail."" Or, ""Come all ye good people, listen while I tell / the fate of Floyd Collins, a lad we all know well.‚Äù ""Come all ye fair and tender ladies / Take warning how you court your men / They're like a star on a summer morning / They first appear and then they're gone again."" And then there‚Äôs this one, ""Gather 'round, people / A story I will tell / 'Bout Pretty Boy Floyd, the outlaw / Oklahoma knew him well.""If you sung all these ""come all ye"" songs all the time like I did, you'd be writing, ""Come gather 'round people where ever you roam, admit that the waters around you have grown / Accept that soon you'll be drenched to the bone / If your time to you is worth saving / And you better start swimming or you'll sink like a stone / The times they are achanging."" You'd have written that too. There's nothing secret about it. You just do it subliminally and unconsciously, because that's all enough, and that's all you know. That was all that was dear to me. They were the only kinds of songs that made sense. ""When you go down to Deep Ellum keep your money in your socks / Women on Deep Ellum put you on the rocks."" Sing that song for a while and you just might come up with, ""When you're lost in the rain in Juarez and it's Easter time too / And your gravity‚Äôs down and negativity don't pull you through / Don‚Äôt put on any airs / When you‚Äôre down on Rue Morgue Avenue / They got some hungry women there / And they really make a mess outta you."" All these songs are connected. Don't be fooled. I just opened up a different door in a different kind of way. It's just different, saying the same thing. I didn't think it was anything out of the ordinary. Well you know, I just thought I was doing something natural, but right from the start, my songs were divisive for some reason. They divided people. I never knew why. Some got angered, others loved them. Didn't know why my songs had detractors and supporters. A strange environment to have to throw your songs into, but I did it anyway. Last thing I thought of was who cared about what song I was writing. I was just writing them. I didn't think I was doing anything different. I thought I was just extending the line. Maybe a little bit unruly, but I was just elaborating on situations. Maybe hard to pin down, but so what? A lot of people are hard to pin down and you‚Äôve just got to bear it. In a sense everything evened itself out. Leiber and Stoller didn‚Äôt think much of my songs. They didn't like 'em, but Doc Pomus did. That was all right that they didn't like 'em, because I never liked their songs either. ""Yakety yak, don't talk back."" ""Charlie Brown is a clown,"" ""Baby I'm a hog for you."" Novelty songs, not serious. Doc's songs, they were better. ""This Magic Moment."" ""Lonely Avenue."" ‚ÄúSave the Last Dance for Me.‚Äù Those songs broke my heart. I figured I'd rather have his blessings any day than theirs. Ahmet Ertegun didn't think much of my songs, but Sam Phillips did. Ahmet founded Atlantic Records. He produced some great records: Ray Charles, Ruth Brown, LaVerne Baker, just to name a few. There were some great records in there, no doubt about it. But Sam Phillips, he recorded Elvis and Jerry Lee, Carl Perkins and Johnny Cash. Radical artists that shook the very essence of humanity. Revolutionaries with vision and foresight. Fearless and sensitive at the same time. Revolution in style and scope. Radical to the bone. Songs that cut you to the bone. Renegades in all degrees, doing songs that would never decay, and still resound to this day. Oh, yeah, I'd rather have Sam Phillips' blessing any day. Merle Haggard didn't think much of my songs, but Buck Owens did, and Buck even recorded some of my early songs. Now I admire Merle -- ""Mama Tried,"" ""Tonight The Bottle Let Me Down,"" ""I'm a Lonesome Fugitive."" I understand all that but I can't imagine Waylon Jennings singing ""The Bottle Let Me Down."" I love Merle but he‚Äôs not Buck. Buck Owens wrote ""Together Again"" and that song trumps anything that ever came out of Bakersfield. Buck Owens and Merle Haggard? If you have to have somebody's blessing -- you figure it out. What I‚Äôm saying here is that my songs seem to divide people. Even people in the music community. People in the critical world too. Critics have always been on my tail since day one. Seems like they‚Äôve always given me special treatment. Some of the music critics say I can't sing. I croak. Sound like a frog. Why don't these same critics say similar things about Tom Waits? They say my voice is shot. That I have no voice. Why don't they say those things about Leonard Cohen? Why do I get special treatment? Critics say I can't carry a tune and I talk my way through a song. Really? I've never heard that said about Lou Reed. Why does he get to go scot-free? What have I done to deserve this special treatment? Why me lord? No vocal range? When's the last time you‚Äôve read that about Dr. John? You‚Äôve never read that about Dr John. Why don't they say that about him? Slur my words, got no diction. You have to wonder if these critics have ever heard Charley Patton or Son House or Wolf. Talk about slurred words and no diction. Why don‚Äôt they say those same things about them. ""Why me, Lord?"" Critics say I mangle my melodies, render my songs unrecognizable. Oh, really? Let me tell you something. I was at a boxing match a few years ago seeing Floyd Mayweather fight a Puerto Rican guy. And the Puerto Rican national anthem, somebody sang it and it was beautiful. It was heartfelt and it was moving. After that it was time for our national anthem. And a very popular soul-singing sister was chosen to sing. She sang every note - - that exists, and some that don't exist. Talk about mangling a melody. You take a onesyllable word and make it last for 15 minutes? She was doing vocal gymnastics like she was a trapeze act. But to me it was not funny.Where were the critics? Mangling lyrics? Mangling a melody? Mangling a treasured song? No, I get the blame. But I don't really think I do that. I just think critics say I do. Sam Cooke said this when told he had a beautiful voice: He said, ""Well that's very kind of you, but voices ought not to be measured by how pretty they are. Instead they matter only if they convince you that they are telling the truth."" Think about that the next time you are listening to a singer. Times always change. They really do. And you have to always be ready for something that's coming along and you never expected it. Way back when, I was in Nashville making some records and I read this article, a Tom T. Hall interview. Tom T. Hall, he was bitching about some kind of new song, and he couldn't understand what these new kinds of songs that were coming in were about. Now Tom, he was one of the most preeminent songwriters of the time in Nashville. A lot of people were recording his songs and he himself even did it. But he was all in a fuss about James Taylor, a song James had called ""Country Road."" Tom was going off in this interview -- ""But James don't say nothing about a country road. He's just says how you can feel it on the country road. I don't understand that."" Now some might say Tom is a great songwriter. I'm not going to doubt that. At the time he was doing this interview I was actually listening to a song of his on the radio. It was called ""I Love."" I was listening to it in a recording studio, and he was talking about all the things he loves, an everyman kind of song, trying to connect with people. Trying to make you think that he's just like you and you're just like him. We all love the same things, and we're all in this together. Tom loves little baby ducks, slow-moving trains and rain. He loves old pickup trucks and little country streams. Sleep without dreams. Bourbon in a glass. Coffee in a cup. Tomatoes on the vine, and onions. Now listen, I'm not ever going to disparage another songwriter. I'm not going to do that. I'm not saying it's a bad song. I'm just saying it might be a little overcooked. But, you know, it was in the top 10 anyway. Tom and a few other writers had the whole Nashville scene sewed up in a box. If you wanted to record a song and get it in the top 10 you had to go to them, and Tom was one of the top guys. They were all very comfortable, doing their thing. This was about the time that Willie Nelson picked up and moved to Texas. About the same time. He's still in Texas. Everything was very copacetic. Everything was all right until -- until -- Kristofferson came to town. Oh, they ain't seen anybody like him. He came into town like a wildcat that he was, flew a helicopter into Johnny Cash'sbackyard, not your typical songwriter. And he went for the throat. ""Sunday Morning Coming Down."" Well, I woke up Sunday morning With no way to hold my head that didn't hurt. And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't bad So I had one more for dessert Then I fumbled through my closet Found my cleanest dirty shirt Then I washed my face and combed my hair And stumbled down the stairs to meet the day. You can look at Nashville pre-Kris and post-Kris, because he changed everything. That one song blew ol‚Äô Tom T. Hall's world apart. He couldn‚Äôt see it coming. It might have sent him to the mad house. God forbid he ever heard any of my songs. You walk into the room With your pencil in your hand You see somebody naked You say, ‚ÄúWho is that man?‚Äù You try so hard But you don‚Äôt understand Just what you're gonna say When you get home But you don‚Äôt know what it is Do you, Mister Jones? If ""Sunday Morning Coming Down"" rattled Tom's cage, sent him into the loony bin, my song surely would have made him blow his brains out, right there in the loony bin. Hopefully he didn't hear it.I just released an album of standards, all the songs usually done by Michael Buble, Harry Connick Jr., maybe Brian Wilson's done a couple, Linda Ronstadt done 'em. Rod of course, even Paul has done some of this kind of material. But the reviews of their records aren‚Äôt like mine. In their reviews no one says anything. In my reviews, they've got to look under every stone and report about it. In the review they get, you seldom see any of the songwriters names. Unlike mine. They've got to mention all the songwriters' names. Well that's OK with me. After all, they're great songwriters and these are standards. I've seen the reviews come in, and they'll mention all the songwriters in half the review, as if everybody knows them. Nobody's heard of them, not in this time, anyway. Buddy Kaye, Cy Coleman, Carolyn Leigh, to name a few. But, you know, I'm glad they mention their names, and you know what? I'm glad they got their names in the press. It might have taken some time to do it, but they're finally there with importance and dignity. I can only wonder why it took so long. My only regret is that they're not here to see it. Traditional rock 'n' roll, we're talking about that. It's all about rhythm. Johnny Cash said it best: ""Get rhythm. Get rhythm when you get the blues."" Very few rock 'n' roll bands today play with rhythm. They don't know what it is. Rock 'n' roll is a combination of blues, and it's a strange thing made up of two parts. A lot of people don't know this, but the blues, which is an American music, is not what you think it is. It's a combination of Arabic violins and Strauss waltzes working it out. But it's true. The other half of rock 'n' roll has got to be hillbilly. And that's a derogatory term, but it ought not to be. That's a term that includes the Delmore Bros., Stanley Bros., Roscoe Holcomb, Git Tanner and the Skillet Lickers ... groups like that. Moonshine gone berserk. Fast cars on dirt roads. That's the kind of combination that makes up rock 'n' roll, and it can't be cooked up in a science laboratory or a studio. You have to have the right kind of rhythm to play this kind of music. If you can't hardly play the blues, and you don‚Äôt have the hillbilly feeling, you‚Äôre not really playing Rock n Roll. It might be something else but it‚Äôs not that. You can fake it, but you can't make it. Critics have said that I‚Äôve made a career out of confounding expectations. Really? Because that's all I do? That's how I think about it. Confounding expectations. Like I stay up late at night thinking about how to do it. ""What do you do for a living, man?"" ""Oh, I confound expectations."" You're going to get a job, the man says, ""What do you do?"" ""Oh, confound expectations.: And the man says, ""Well, we already have that spot filled. Call us back. Or don't call us, we'll call you."" Confounding expectations. I don‚Äôt even know what that means or who has time for it.‚ÄòWhy me, Lord? My work confounds them obviously, but I really don't know how I do it. The Blackwood Bros. have been talking to me about making a record together. That might confound expectations, but it shouldn't. Of course it would be a gospel album. I don't think it would be anything out of the ordinary for me. Not a bit. One of the songs I'm thinking about singing is ""Stand By Me"" with the Blackwood Brothers. Not ""Stand By Me"" the pop song. No. The real ""Stand By Me."" The real one goes like this: When the storm of life is raging / Stand by me / When the storm of life is raging / Stand by me / When the world is tossing me / Like a ship upon the sea / Thou who rulest wind and water / Stand by me In the midst of tribulation / Stand by me / In the midst of tribulation / Stand by me / When the hosts of hell assail / And my strength begins to fail / Thou whomever lost a battle / Stand by me In the midst of faults and failures / Stand by me / In the midst of faults and failures / Stand by me / When I do the best I can / And my friends don't understand/ Thou who knowest all about me / Stand by me That's the song. I like it better than the pop song. If I record one by that name, that's going to be the one. I'm also thinking of recording a song, not for that album, though ‚Äì a song called ""Oh Lord, Please Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood."" But I don‚Äôt know, it might be good on the gospel album too. Anyway, I'm proud to be here tonight for MusiCares. I'm honored to have all these artists singing my songs. There's nothing like that. Great artists. Who all know how to sing the truth, and you can hear it in their voices. I'm proud to be here tonight for MusiCares. I think a lot of this organization. They've helped many people. Many musicians who have contributed a lot to our culture. I'd like to personally thank them for what they did for a friend of mine, Billy Lee Riley. A friend of mine who they helped for six years when he was down and couldn't work. Billy was a Sun rock 'n' roll artist. He was a true original. He did it all; played, sang and wrote. He would have been a bigger star but Jerry Lee came along. And you know what happens when someone like that comes along. You kind of have to take a step back. You just don't stand a chance. So Billy became what is known in the industry -- a condescending term, by the way -- as a one-hit wonder. But sometimes, just sometimes, once in a while, a one hit wonder can make a more powerful impact than a recording star who's got 20 or 30 hits behind him. And Billy's hit song was called ""Red Hot,"" and it was red hot. It could blast you out of your skull and make you feel happy about it. Change your life. He did it with power and style and grace. You won't find him in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. He's not there. Metallica is. Abba is. Mamas and the Papas -- I know they're in there. Jefferson Airplane, Alice Cooper, Steely Dan -- I've got nothing against Metal, Soft Rock, Hard Rock, Psychedelic Pop. I got nothing against any of that stuff. But after all, it is called the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Billy Lee Riley is not there. Yet. And it‚Äôs taking too long. I'd see him a couple times a year and we'd always spent time together and he was on a rockabilly festival nostalgia circuit, and we'd cross paths now and again. We'd always spend time together. He was a hero of mine. I'd heard ""Red Hot."" I must have been only 15 or 16 when I did and it's impressed me to this day. I never grow tired of listening to it. Never got tired of watching Billy Lee perform, either. We spent time together just talking and playing into the night. He was a deep, truthful man. He wasn't bitter or nostalgic. He just accepted it. He knew where he had come from and he was content with who he was. And then one day he got sick. And like my friend John Mellencamp would sing -- because John sang some truth today -- one day you get sick and you don't get better. That's from a song of his called ""Life is Short Even on Its Longest Days."" It's one of the better songs of the last few years, actually. I ain't lying. And I ain't lying when I tell you that MusiCares paid for my friend's doctor bills, mortgage and gave him spending money. They were able to at least make his life comfortable, tolerable to the end. That is something that can't be repaid. Any organization that would do that would have to have my blessing. I'm going to get out of here now. I'm going to put an egg in my shoe and beat it. I probably left out a lot of people and said too much about some. But that's OK. Like the spiritual song, 'I'm still just crossing over Jordan too.' Let's hope we meet again. Sometime. And we will, if, like Hank Williams says, ""the good Lord willing and the creek don't rise.‚ÄùSee Bob Dylan LiveGet tickets as low as $38You might also likeEmbed",en,LABEL_0,0.4873955547809601,LABEL_1,0.5126044154167175

Je ferai nos bagages
Pour d'infinies vendanges
Les formules magiques
Des marabouts d'Afrique
J'les dirai sans remords
Pour que tu m'aimes encore
Je m'inventerai reine
Pour que tu me retiennes
Je me ferai nouvelle
Pour que le feu reprenne
Je deviendrai ces autres
Qui te donnent du plaisir
Vos jeux seront les n√¥tres

I understood all the words, I well understood, thanks
Reasonable and new, that's the way here
Things have changed, that flowers get fade
That the time before, was the time before
If all zap and tire, loves also go by
You must know

I'll go get your heart if you take it somewhere else
Even if in your dances others dance your hours
I'll go get your soul in the colds in the flammes
I'll cast a spell on you for you to still love me

Shouldn't begin tease me touch me
Shouldn't give so much I don't know how to play
They say that today, they say others do so
I'm not the others
Before we attach to the other, before we spoil each other
Je veux que tu saches
I want you to know

I'll go get your heart if you take it somewhere else
Even if in your dances others dance your hours
I'll go get your soul in the colds in the flammes
I'll cast a spell on you for you to still love me

I'll find languages to sing your praises
I'll make my luggage‚Äôs for infinite vintages
Magic spells from African priests
I'll say them without remorse for you to still love me

I'll name myself queen for you to hold me
I'll make myself new to let the fire restart
I'll become these others who give you pleasure
Your games will be ours if that's your wish
More brilliant more beautiful for another spark
I'll change myself into gold for you to still love me9Embed",fr,1 star,0.020815571770071983,2 stars,0.03749466314911842

Qu'importe, les mots n'ont plus la moindre importance
Car le ballet
Ah a commenc√©
Il met ses plus beaux atours et du miel sur sa voix

Il te dit po√®mes et r√™ves et lointains voyages

Va s'animer
Il a su les codes et donner les bons mots de passe
Encore un peu d'alcool et que tombent les cuirasses
Livr√©es les cl√©s des corps, enfin les peaux s'embrassent
Et le temps s'arr√™te tant que dure la gr√¢ce

Pendant que l'ennemi r√©vise des r√©pliques de Cindy Crawford
Le ciel s'assombrit, j'ram√®ne dix milles corbeaux √† ta fiesta
J'roule le miel gras et j'passe le cierge √† ton fils, et ouais
Quand il est tard, les grands XXX d√©barquent
Brandissent des sbars et remplissent les pages comme personne
Vente ill√©gale de vraies proses, j'r√©colte des belles sommes
Et je m'offre de l'herbe forte puis j'd√©veloppe ma glande pin√©ale
J'maitrise troisi√®me ≈ìil d'Horus et XXX
Mon rap te botte, c'est une chose sure, au-dessus, c'est l'Soleil
Voila c'qui s'passe quand des insectes de merde
Croisent des baleines, √ßa fait...

Un 16, deux 16, trois 16, quatre 16
Fixpen Singe, Nova, on fait la paire
Un 16, deux 16, trois 16, quatre 16
Fixpen Singe, Gr√ºnt, on fait la paire

J'parle comme un gosse malpoli, (Pute!), ruisseau lyrical
J'suis l'original, les autres sont des Lomepal-copies
Le cuisto dirige √ßa, confonds pas boire
Une vodka tonique et s'prendre une cuite au minibar
Flingue verbal, le crash s'amorce en douce
Leurs noms, leurs √¢ges, pas d'importance
J'leur rentre dedans √† la Code Quantum
Ils repartent le bassin flottant
Tu fais du boucan, pi√®tre morveux
Mais ton temps sur l'ring ne dure pas un tour entier de trotteuse
Te-tar express, le jeu s'av√®re sec
Mais ce rap me colle au pelage comme une grenade semtex
Le voil√† corrosif, je t'avoue que comme deux-trois accrocs
Au micro, j'me sens pris d'un devoir rapologique
Et j'assume ce r√¥le, j'suis sinc√®re, mes neurones cuisent
Et j'ai la formule pour te cr√©er ce produit

Un 16, deux 16, trois 16, quatre 16
Fixpen Singe, Nova, on fait la paire
Un 16, deux 16, trois 16, quatre 16
Fixpen Singe, Gr√ºnt, on fait la paire

√áa fait un bail, je m'installe, prise du micro imm√©diate
J'prie afin d'r√©unir les conditions id√©ales
J'mets en place un casting d'actrices de cin√©ma juste pour un film
O√π on d√Æne sans habits sur un parking 'vec du Heavy Metal
K.E.K.E.R¬†! Le Do muni d'une batte en bois
J'exploite ma cadence verbale et bats le fer
Taille dans le vercor, prend ma retraite, j'fais l'mort
Dans ma recette, j'bosse, rare les rimes qui correspondent √† ma requ√™te
Lequel de tes potes en fera le test, dis moi
J'parle de technique, quoi, mon esprit ne prend pas de ch√®que
J'reste droit, mon intellect est propre, je m'√©fforce d'√™tre vif
Afin que t'aies l'air √©tonn√©, j'vais te donner de l'or en seize rimes
On s'int√©resse des fois au reste mais c'est rare, j'ai des phases
Qui viennent, la civi√®re est l√† pour les tra√Ætres et les l√¢ches
Mes textes d√©m√©nagent, mes phases datent d'hier
J'porjette les flammes d'un briquet pour faire cramer tes sapes
Do¬†!

Un 16, deux 16, trois 16, quatre 16
Fixpen Singe, Gr√ºnt, on fait la paire
Un 16, deux 16, trois 16, quatre 16
Fixpen Singe et Nova on fait la paire

Un 16, deux, je t'en mets plein les yeux
What else¬†? J'trouve que rien n'est mieux qu'moi-m√™me
√áa vient d'en face, on en est qu'aux pr√©sentations, toutes vos amies
Ont des sensations dans les jambes d√®s que j'entame un nouveau chapitre
√áa tourne au drame si tu redoutes nos agents, sache
Qu'on conna√Æt tous nos classiques sur le bout d'nos phalanges
J'envoie des phases qui couchent du flow comme Jacques-Yves Cousteau
Nombreux sont ceux qui parmi nous s'dopent
Mais font le boulot √† temps
T'as la trempe de Dany Boon, je manie full crom'
Repars en moonwalk sans qu'le tapis bouge
Tu choures nos grammes, j'esp√®re que t'as les parties souples
Un paquet d'couches neuves, une blouse pour quelques jours au calme
On fait pas d'photographie, l'avalanche t'ait pass√© dessus
Jette-moi cette arme automatique, sa cadence n'est pas r√©guli√®re
On reste souples et agiles, transformation Jackie Choun
Comme un porte-avion, j'arrive lourd
Et tactique comme un pari d'football
 2
Un 16, deux 16, trois 16, quatre 16
Fixpen Singe, Gr√ºnt, on fait la paire
Un 16, deux 16, trois 16, quatre 16
Fixpen Singe et Nova on fait la paire

On br√ªle toutes vos b√™tes phases, c'est gratuit
Un classique voit le jour m√™me si le bail se fait la nuit
Des restes de putes sous nos AirMax, j'arrive bient√¥t pour tout fumer
Comme si j'√©tait dans un bus pour Rotterdam
J'ai ce truc New-Yorkais, aight ! Et la suite
Logique des choses, c'est que les concurrents prennent la fuite
Philly-Phaal monte quand je bouge pas √† Paris
Le sable sous la gabardine, fusion des Super Sayan Jin
L'union de l'agilit√© du gu√©pard, la force du lion
On est la cr√®me, pas besoin qu'nous te le jurions
Pulsions meurtri√®res, pour me calmer, roule un blunt direct
Met toute la beuh qui reste, motherfucker

Tu peux m'voir rue de Tobiac, Nike air
Aux pieds, quand j'gratte j'crache des balles comme Dorian Tyrell
J'fais mes trucs tout seul
Aussi vrai que √ßa te d√©mange de taper ""Dorian Tyrell"" sur Google
Bref, j'ai du style, mais ils veulent plus de pirouettes
Ils ne savent pas que ma plume de jeune loup
Vaut le prix d'un snuff movie sur le deep web
Un singe ou une perle sur le torse
J'r√©aliserai mes r√™ves purs de gosse
D'ailleurs j'compte bien r√©volutionner l'jeudi soir
J'ai le pouvoir de refaire l'histoire
J'suis venu br√ªler vos t√™tes, levez vos extincteurs √† la Bellevilloise
Y'a de moins en moins de s√©rieux bosseurs
Les emcee baclent leurs √©critures comme de vieux docteurs
Mais nos mixtapes flinguent
Les autres flippent c'est simple
Ils ne sont pas pr√™t pour l'impact qu'aura le Fixpen Singe
Vidji, K√©rou√©, Caba, Meyso
Sous les couleurs de Gr√ºnt, pour les soupeurs
On pr√©pare le miel des abeilles jaunes

C'est pas l'sentiment d'intrusion qui rongent la France
Ni les textes Fillon mais les r√™ves de millions
Pris la main dans l'sac de ceux qui n'font qu'la tendre
Face aux forces adverses, on traverse l'apocalypse
Mais qu'il faille √™tre brave ou martyr, je n'serai pas votre homme car
J'ai mes propres limites mes propres taches
Si rien ne sort de Vidji, rien ne remplira ses poches
La musique joue un air d'√©poque en fond d'toile
Me rappelle quand j'me demandais encore
Pourquoi faire des gosses dans c'monde froid
La vie, c'est absurde, y'a pas de responsable
Ces rimes sont la chronique d'un damn√© d'ailleurs c'est mon patronyme
J'recherche un id√©al pur, √† charge de revanche car
Ce n'sera gr√¢ce et √† leu 'sness qu'on fera notre bille
Oui, j'r√™ve d'une victoire √©clatante avec la mention styl√©e
Quand j'rappe, j'ai jamais besoin d'r√©clamer l'attention, qui sait
C'qui peut arriver donc j'veux pas ramer dix piges, d√®s
Que j'empoche le cash des petits certs-con, j'repars avec Easy Jet
C'est vite aif', aucun style de forme
Le vice de Tom Selleck
OK, j'me suis cass√© la gueule mais c'est pas grave
Pour m'rattraper, j'envoie une disquette simple
C'est Gr√ºnt, Nova avec Fixpen Singe

J'me ferai une joie de devoir te caner mais j'crois qu'ce soir
J'ai la flemme de faire quoi que ce soit, pas de choix de th√®mes
A toi d'voir, j'm‚Äôassois deux fois sur ta t√™te, je pr√©pare la mixture
Qui br√ªle, promis jur√©, croix de bois, croix de fer
La force centrifuge te broie le cerveau, je m'explose
Il serait temps qu'j'diffuse de belles proses m√™me si c'est sans issue
Ambiance de f√™te foraine, pauvre merde, on va t'brosser
Crosser tes pommettes avec du velcro, garde tes probl√®mes
J'm'en contre balance, t'as pas une once de talent
Avec ta tronche de quarantenaire, tu comptes me battre ?
Renseigne-toi, tu t'trompes de gars, nan ?
Un tour de cadran √† ma montre
Je fonce sans cons√©quence, j'te plombe le bas-ventre
...la louche est pr√™te
Un couplet de plus, √ßa vous √©nerve, tant pis
...c'est de vous faire grandir, sans rire
L'album d√©boule √† grande foul√©e, j'ai laiss√© la porte entrouverte
J'remets l'couvert donc soupez avant d'couler
Soupez !

Tu voulais qu'j'parte mais j'reste l√†, dans l'fond, t'aimes √ßa
D√®s qu'j'passe √† l'action, j'fais l'taff
J'me plonge dans mes cahiers pour sortir la t√™te de l'eau
T'sais pas qu'ma passion c'est d'la natation¬†?
Putain, qu'est-ce que j'ai ce soir, je sais pas
C'est pas grave, j'ai fum√© un peu trop de wax
Tout √ßa, √ßa s'passe √† Bruxelles, c'est abus√©
Tu sais bien que j'fais que carburer
On m'appelle Method Cab
Tu sais bien, j'fais qu'du Ralph Lauren
Pas d'probl√®me, salet√© d'p√©tasse
J'suis un pro en impro, j'fais des ABBA
Imp√©n√©trable, j'me suis rattrap√©
Cavalier est l√† donc tu vas cavaler

On est tous obs√©d√©s par la vengeance et les repr√©sailles
Merde, ce n'√©tait pas le v≈ìu d'mes a√Øeux
Plus l'temps d'pleurer, √ßa y est, les plus nerveux d√©raillent, quoi
C'est partout comme √ßa, il n'y aura pas moins de querelles ailleurs
La raison a foutu l'camp et les plus forts perdent
La boule juste en bousculant les faibles sous le tramway
Quoi, hein¬†? Parce que tout l'monde aime le go√ªt du sang
Seulement personne n'est assez honn√™te pour se l'avouer
J'compte plus les d√©fauts des hommes, en manque de sexe
Les fils de pute emmagasinent trop de testost√©rone
Probl√®me d'√©go et d'honneur mais qu'est-ce qu'tu veux¬†?
L'√™tre humain avait appris a faire du mal avant de faire du feu
J'essaie d'vibrer mais j'te jure que c'est stressant
De perdre son temps alors que son futur r√©tr√©cit
J'crains plus l'd√©ces, nan, j'ai juste peur de pas
Avoir le temps d'tout faire en seulement une d√©cennie
Tous mes frangins l'savent, rien qu'depuis hier
Moult dents ont √©t√© ramass√©es √† la petite cuill√®re
J'ai d√©j√† √©t√© soudainement plein d'rage mais j'suis fier
De jamais avoir eu l'inconscience de shooter dans un cr√¢ne
Mieux vaut esquiver ses ennemis comme √† Mario-
Land, reste discret, reste peace
Mais, s'il le faut, combats la violence par la violence
M√™me si c'est loin d'√™tre une √©tape passionnante

V'l√† un hymne national, attends que je t'explique le truc
Les plus na√Øfs se prostituent, parle moi du prestige de l'uniforme
Un truc si rare qu'ils en ont presque le cul qui transpire
Avertissement ultime avant qu'on ach√®ve les survivants
Parle moi de lexique, de multi, bon, excuse-moi mais
C'qui excite le public, je m'en tape les couilles avec une raquette
J'aime pas les starlettes hautaines, me parlez pas d'mes probl√®mes
On aurait plus vite fait l'tour en Jeep qu'en reliant Mars et Beauvais
Parle moi d'un syst√®me o√π les valeurs sont les bonnes
N'aie pas peur, on t'escortera jusqu'au bal Cendrillon
Mais reste lucide quant √† ceux qui changent de marque selon les codes
Car ils savent se fondre et forment un cadre o√π l'argent triomphe
Paw¬†! Dis moi que t'aimerais donner des cours d'art abstrait
Continue d'jacasser histoire que j'me foute par la fen√™tre
Et j'ai pas la fin d'ce texte et j'aurais d√ª l'pr√©m√©diter
Mais c'est pas grave, au mic, j'vais les exterminer
C'est ouf, ma voix s'harmonise au son d'la basse
√âcoute, j'rappe pour parer les coups d'battes
Tel un moine shaolin, j'carbonise ma proie
Fa√ßon Stakhanov, m'raconte pas ta love story coquine
Ou alors ta carotide sera froide
Prie, car t'agonies, √ßa s'voit
A chaque shoot, j'humilie le pivot
Switch, tu piges vite le niveau
Aussi vrai qu'un alcoolique a soif
Ou qu'un commissaire s'assoit
Sur des jolies bavures commise par la police chaque soir
Frappe √† 10 m√®tres, t'es mort dans l'√©pisode comme Trivet
A coups d'lames de Gilette Mach 3, toujours en finesse
J'tire sec les ficelles qui dirigent les pin-ups
Une pichenette sur l'deagle, le business s‚Äôaccro√Æt, efface l'ardoise en vitesse
Sanguinaire, l'instinct primaire en disette
T'es intrigu√© mais tu t'es pris des chiquettes narquoise
La gentillesse est parfois un vilain d√©faut
Si l'un des n√¥tres est impliqu√©, j'm'invite, presse la d√©tente
C'est sans l'bruit des sir√®nes que j'm'enfuirai par l'toit
Y'a quoi¬†?

Ma victoire, ma victoire
J'y crois parce que j'ai foi en Dieu mais surtout parce que
Toi, on dirait moi en vieux et qu'moi on dirait toi en mieux
La finesse dans chaque prose, t'es peut-√™tre dans l'building
Mais depuis il pue l'caca et c'est pas un probl√®me de chasse d'eau
J'les chambre, j'les terrasse deux fois plus, j'vaux l'prix d'un ch√¢teau
Je suis deux fois plus le boss comme un chameau
Les grands me tirent leurs chapeaux car c'est vrai
Qu'il y a plus que des cons maintenant et sans pr√©tention
J'rends ce Rap de merde beaucoup plus convaincant
Chut, gros...
Est-ce que t'entends la m√©lodie du changement ?
Bruyante et instoppable comme une chute d'eau
La famille du Hip-Hop je m'en branle, ils pensent franchement
√ätre mes jumeaux mais ce sont mes enfants, han han
Ouais, Caba vous l'a dit, appelez-le Papa ou Daddy
J'ai toujours pas d'tatoos qui tapissent ma face
J'ai toujours pas d'amour pour les sales
Pouffes comme ta petite nana
Dans tes r√™ves t'es Chris Brown, tu t'tapes Rihanna
Dans mes r√™ves j'fais comme Chris Brown, je tape Rihanna

Le temps presse, il m'faut l'pouvoir de Piper avec le peu que j'ai
Je m'entraine sans cesse √† faire d'grands textes
C'est comme un gros tournoi de Fight Club
'vec des placements d'ma√Ætres dont les rimes
Ne sont que la forme sournoise de l'iceberg
En bref, une science sacr√©e, le genre d'merde qui les rend faibles
En scred et les enterre √† l'usure comme de l'amiante cach√©e
J'√©cris, d√©cide et cette vie durable m'a l'air pr√©cieuse
Pr√©cis, j'aiguiserai mes rimes jusqu'√† c'que √ßa cr√®ve les yeux
A l'√©cart, j'me cache au calme pour esquiver les esprits vider
J'attendrais cal√© l√† qu'ces salauds s'crachent
J'suis pas m√©chant mais j'ai milles id√©es
Et j'rentrerai dans la l√©gende, quitte √† passer par l'√©chafaudage
Le style de vie des pires givr√©s
J'gratte avant qu'ces f√™l√©s m'arrache le r√™ve de rimer puis d'briller
Ent√™t√©, j'ai la rage de perdre mais j'essaie d'√©viter mes ennemis
J'veux pas finir enterr√© avec la hache de guerre

J'suis puissant dans mes textes, diligent dans mes ffaires-a
Je m'introduis bri√®vement, j'taffe pr√©cis mais j'encaisse cash
J'ai pas des milliers d'plans, fr√®re, √ßa d√©pend qui les demande
Mais s'il s'agit de billets d'cent, l√†, t'es pri√© de m'en faire part
La technique est ancestrale, les outils modernes
On √©tourdit vos t√™tes, suivez-nous, c'est rect-di et sans escale
Han ! Ta tape c'est de l'eau d'Javel
T'es pas un d√©mon sur la piste, l'ami, arr√™te les Vodka-Get's
J'ai jamais serr√© d'orvaltaise mais faudra p't√™t, c'est l'occas'
Tu crois qu'tu t'sors d'affaire mais votre Altesse est loquace
Trop tard on a p√©t√© votre starters, accepte les choses, la perte est totale
Y'a pas d‚Äôex-√¶quo avec les clones, ta merde est trop d√©modable
On va pas baisser les bras ni t'prouver par A plus B qu'c'est l√©gal
Quand j'rappe, tu vois le D.A r√©ajuster ses Ray Ban
Dans l'sas, on met des droites comme Cassius Clay
On pr√©pare une attaque muscl√©e, on a su rester en place

Chaque verset, c'est pile dans l'mille, j‚Äôexerce ma force et file tranquille
Dans les hautes sph√®res, les autres se perdent car j'les distance vite
Atmosph√®re propice √† l‚Äôaust√©rit√©, pourtant nous prosp√©rons
Les faux s'prosternent, sans gros ch√®ques nous op√©rons
J'profite pas trop des clich√©s, j'ai pas ma t√™te sur des prospectus
J'cogite car trop d'v√©rit√©s se sont cach√©es dans des proc√©dures
Nos √©tudes s'r√©sument √† penser √† des phases qui butent
Le Rap s'diffuse partout, j'y rajoute juste un peu d'attitude
C'est concluant d√®s le premier essai car
Je vise la coupe, la louche d'or pr√©sent√©e sur un r√©ceptacle
La concurrence essaie d'cacher nos comp√©tences, on
Gratte sans complaisance sur des cahiers, du papier Canson
Donc j'parle, constate qu'on a encore d'la route √† faire
Toute la semaine dans c'Rap jusqu‚Äô√† m'en foutre la gerbe, c'est comme √ßa
Je pense √† tout l√¢cher mais l'doute am√®ne de bonnes basses
Pour vous la mettre, j'attendrai pas que tout √ßa vienne de votre part

Ont-ils fait de moi un t√©n√©breux barjot ?
Imagine deux √©p√©es de Dark Maul √† chaque extr√©mit√©s de l'√©p√©e de Dark Maul
Crampons sous la plante du pied, mitraillettes aux bras !
L'√¢me d'un aventurier, les r√©flexes d'un super soldat
Lomepal est un dr√¥le d'oiseau, sortit de la foire aux monstres
Quoi d'autre? Je me d√©voile au monde, tu veux me voir mort?
Compte la-dessus et bois de l'eau, tout mes ennemis flanchent et perdent
J'ai un arc qui lance des fl√®ches pleines de guano
Ne tremblez pas, mesdames messieurs
Je suis gentil m√™me si je lance des lasers par les yeux
Mon corps peut canaliser trente piles emmagasin√©es
Dents de tigres et branchies, j'agrandis mes capacit√©s
Vous pensiez percer tout les myst√®res, mince!
La Nasa vous a cach√© le Fixpen Singe
Ras-le-bol, nique la flotte, je bois que des 16
Je viens peut-√™tre du futur comme Arnold, hein!

T'as peut-√™tre pass√© dix piges √† m'espionner
Mais dans l'fond, connais-tu vraiment Caaab?
L'hybride am√©lior√©, issu des codes g√©n√©tiques de Morpheus et de Gandalf
Hein, ouvrez vos esgourdes, ou je vais finir par les violer
Slurp slurp, allez venez go√ªter nos belles soupes
Bien chaudes, donc faites gaffe au br√ªlures
Pur jus et volupt√©, je ne fait qu'√©voluer, priez pour que je ne mute plus
Jamais le spliff s‚Äô√©teint, stylo et micro chrom√©
Regarde comment ils brillent, mes flingues
Vos idoles on les verra plus, les boss vont en virer plein
La Nasa vous a cach√© le putain de Fixpen Singe !
Qui vole trop haut, qui est dans le ciel, qui dirige l'avion?
Qui d√©tient le savoir des anciennes civilisations ?
Hein? Qui, hein? C'est bien l'oozaru qui fume son blunt
Oublie la cig' et son petit singe

Hein, je suis un MC cr√©√© de toute pi√®ces
Issu d'un croisement interdit entre un Y√©ti et douze hy√®nes
Je ne m'inqui√®te ni des poules qui mordent, ni des imb√©ciles
Rajoute une pinc√©e de shit, des clous de girofle
Et vient servir cette soupe ti√®de
La tienne est la plus insipide et fade de l'ann√©e, je garde
Les yeux tourn√©s vers l'infini, les astres m'appellent
Ce que voudrait bien Vidji, c'est le plein de phillies blunt
Une petite meuf, des disques et un flingue qui tire des tasses de caf√©
Le style est simple et file des migraines dingues
On l'a dit la Nasa vous a cach√© le Fixpen Singe
Je suis la fusion entre une √©toile et de l'orange bud
J'ai vu se d√©ployer notre empire quand tu nettoies les chiottes en pleurant
Plus fort qu'Harry Po-tter
Je fais des petits tours de magie quand je transforme tes bijoux de famille en Knacki ball
Trunks m'arrive √† la cheville gauche
En guerre faut d√©penser sans compter le cash
Venez dans notre agence, on fait le taff'

Je sors du labo rafistol√© comme Frankenstein
Ils chopent la gangr√®ne mais me sortent encore la m√™me rengaine, je taille
Des couplets troubles, tout ceux qui poussent et qui s'empressent trop
Les tirs-au-flanc fuient au loin, j'ai mis au point de rites ancestraux
Courez tous, j'√©coute et fous par terre ta collec' de CD de merde
√áa fait des semaines que j‚Äôattendais de r√©gler ce di√®se
J'ai les yeux verts mais parfois, ils deviennent rouges
Le ciel se couvre, dans le noir √ßa reste impossible de d√©celer le pi√®ge
Fuuusion! Pulsion meurtri√®re
Toujours au m√™me endroit que la veille, √† la m√™me heure qu'hier
Fuuusion! La mutation s‚Äôamorce
Bouff√©e de chaleur tous les quarts d'heure
Tes pulsations s'accordent au compte √† rebours de ma bombe chimique
La Nasa vous a cach√© le Fixpen Singe
Plus d'actions √† quatre, √† jeun avec mes condisciples
En d√©calage par rapport aux artistes mesquins

Vous verrez bient√¥t notre alliance plomber le tas
On est n√©s par la science, c'est par la science qu'on cr√®vera
La fusion de cinq gagnants, tous brulants d'impatience
Venus d√©pecer les hommes, c'est de la viande qu'on laissera
Fuyez, vous verrez bient√¥t notre alliance plomber le tas
On est n√©s par la science, c'est par la science qu'on cr√®vera
La fusion de cinq gagnants, tous brulants d'impatience
Venus d√©pecer les hommes, c'est de la viande qu'on laissera
Fuyez!

Primero ! Leur travail est b√¢cl√©, g√¢ch√©
Mais leurs clients ne sont pas lass√©s, j'suis f√¢ch√©
Donc j'√©veille leurs √¢mes, allez, on est des seigneurs, sachez
Qu'on d√©tient la meilleure came que tu peux acheter sur le march√©, putain
Segundo ! Dans mon sweat propre, je m√¢che un chewing-gum
En sachant qu'le jus qu'on cuisine vaudra quelques beaux milliards
Brillants comme des louis d'or, admirez notre filiale
Cuisine de rimes aphrodisiaques, les auditeurs vont jouir fort
Tercero ! On tient leur jeu dans les mains, c'est pli√©
Le nom c'est Fixpen Singe, au cas o√π on vous demanderait d'synth√©tiser
Maintenant l'terrain est min√©, oui, on bosse dur
La concurrence reviendra un 31 f√©vrier
Laisse le bail se faire, j'suis ailleurs, certes
Mais j'ai des projets ambitieux comme Heisenberg
Gildas... Mes √©quipiers traduiront
Personne ne sais ce qu'on va devenir mais je m'inqui√®te pas/
Puisqu'on fournit cette merde en gros ou au d√©tail
Les concurrents font demi-tour et rentrent au bercail
Fixpen Singe, la poule aux ≈ìufs d'or, cr√©ateur du nouveau jeu
Le boulot sera fait avant la deadline

On s'introduit par toutes les failles, on fait l'bail
Manigance avant la deadline, verre d'Hei-
-neken et gros p√®t, aight !
Pour √™tre rempli de Force comme les couilles d'un Jedi
Gonfl√© √† bloc comme ma bulle d'air, pr√™t √† pr√©parer l'produit
Mes neurones puisent dans mon stock de vocabulaire
Il n'y a qu'de l'or au bout d'la cha√Æne de montage
Oui, quelle bonne alchimie entre les quatre bijoutiers, ach√®te ce bon Rap
Il te sera d√©livr√© par l'un d'nos dix coursiers, on d√©pose des cadeaux
Dans tes petits souliers comme le P√®re No√´l, en gros...
On t'am√®ne le son rare en √©change d'un ch√®que
Est-ce que tu acceptes le contrat ?
Fly comme une descente en skyfall
L'entreprise fonctionne toute la nuit comme un night shop
Quelle horrible chaleur, la manufacture surchauffe
Une fois pr√™t, les colis seront livr√©s pile √† l'heure
On fournit cette merde en gros ou au d√©tail
Les concurrents font demi-tour et rentrent au bercail
Fixpen Singe, la poule aux ≈ìufs d'or, cr√©ateur du nouveau jeu
Le boulot sera fait avant la deadline

R√©ellement efficace, cach√© dans le maquis avec mes potes
Pr√®s du grand canyon, je prend le calibre dans mes vir√©es en bagnole
J'organise un effet de mode bien avant que t‚Äôarrive
Manie l‚Äôaisance, la rime, pour ne pas d√©filer quand √ßa cogne
L'aisance m'anime, je dois me mettre √† couvert
Les s√©quences de ma vie gravitent en abritant des tas de soucis
C'est marche ou cr√®ve, le cr√¢ne se bousille √† la vitesse des balles
Tous les gars rabougris je les canne √† coup de rimes pour ta gouverne
J'avoue je perd mes nerfs, j'efface mes souvenirs
Je me met √©chec et mat seul, c'est la que/
Je me rend compte que je ne peux pas courir, c'est ce que ces garces veulent
Je me met √† sourire, c'est pendant que tu roupilles que l'√©cart se creuse
Et je ne peux pas me soumettre, j'ai assouvi mes envies sans √ßa
Dans le silence je pratique ma mise en place
Et je ne sais pas, je pourrais me tromper sur les songes qui m'angoissent
C'est long, j'ai oubli√© le d√©compte mais bon, quoi qu'il en soit...

Hennebeau s‚Äô√©tait mis devant la fen√™tre de son cabinet, pour voir partir la cal√®che qui emmenait sa femme d√©jeuner √† Marchiennes. Il avait suivi un instant N√©grel trottant pr√®s de la porti√®re ; puis, il √©tait revenu tranquillement s‚Äôasseoir √† son bureau. Quand ni sa femme ni son neveu ne l‚Äôanimaient du bruit de leur existence, la maison semblait vide. Justement, ce jour-l√†, le cocher conduisait madame ; Rose, la nouvelle femme de chambre, avait cong√© jusqu‚Äô√† cinq heures ; et il ne restait qu‚ÄôHippolyte, le valet de chambre, se tra√Ænant en pantoufles par les pi√®ces, et que la cuisini√®re, occup√©e depuis l‚Äôaube √† se battre avec ses casseroles, tout enti√®re au d√Æner que ses ma√Ætres donnaient le soir. Aussi, M. Hennebeau se promettait-il une journ√©e de gros travail, dans ce grand calme de la maison d√©serte.
Vers neuf heures, bien qu‚Äôil e√ªt re√ßu l‚Äôordre de renvoyer tout le monde, Hippolyte se permit d‚Äôannoncer Dansaert, qui apportait des nouvelles. Le directeur apprit seulement alors la r√©union tenue la veille, dans la for√™t ; et les d√©tails √©taient d‚Äôune telle nettet√©, qu‚Äôil l‚Äô√©coutait en songeant aux amours avec la Pierronne, si connus, que deux ou trois lettres anonymes par semaine d√©non√ßaient les d√©bordements du ma√Ætre-porion : √©videmment, le mari avait caus√©, cette police-l√† sentait le traversin. Il saisit m√™me l‚Äôoccasion, il laissa entendre qu‚Äôil savait tout, et se contenta de recommander la prudence, dans la crainte d‚Äôun scandale. Effar√© de ces reproches, au travers de son rapport, Dansaert niait, b√©gayait des excuses, tandis que son grand nez avouait le crime, par sa rougeur subite. Du reste, il n‚Äôinsista pas, heureux d‚Äôen √™tre quitte √† si bon compte ; car, d‚Äôordinaire, le directeur se montrait d‚Äôune s√©v√©rit√© implacable d‚Äôhomme pur, d√®s qu‚Äôun employ√© se passait le r√©gal d‚Äôune jolie fille, dans une fosse. L‚Äôentretien continua sur la gr√®ve, cette r√©union de la for√™t n‚Äô√©tait encore qu‚Äôune fanfaronnade de braillards, n‚Äôen ne mena√ßait s√©rieusement. En tout cas, les corons ne bougeraient s√ªrement pas de quelques jours, sous l‚Äôimpression de peur respectueuse que la promenade militaire du matin devait avoir produite.
Lorsque M. Hennebeau se retrouva seul, il fut pourtant sur le point d‚Äôenvoyer une d√©p√™che au pr√©fet. La crainte de donner inutilement cette preuve d‚Äôinqui√©tude le retint. Il ne se pardonnait d√©j√† pas d‚Äôavoir manqu√© de flair, au point de dire partout, d‚Äô√©crire m√™me √† la R√©gie, que la gr√®ve durerait au plus une quinzaine. Elle s‚Äô√©ternisait depuis pr√®s de deux mois, √† sa grande surprise ; et il s‚Äôen d√©sesp√©rait, il se sentait chaque jour diminu√©, compromis, forc√© d‚Äôimaginer un coup d‚Äô√©clat, s‚Äôil voulait rentrer en gr√¢ce pr√®s des r√©gisseurs. Il leur avait justement demand√© des ordres, dans l‚Äô√©ventualit√© d‚Äôune bagarre. La r√©ponse tardait, il l‚Äôattendait par le courrier de l‚Äôapr√®s-midi. Et il se disait qu‚Äôil serait temps alors de lancer des t√©l√©grammes, pour faire occuper militairement les fosses, si telle √©tait l‚Äôopinion de ces messieurs. Selon lui, ce serait la bataille, du sang et des morts, √† coup s√ªr. Une responsabilit√© pareille le troublait, malgr√© son √©nergie habituelle.
Jusqu‚Äô√† onze heures, il travailla paisiblement, sans autre bruit, dans la maison morte, que le b√¢ton √† cirer d‚ÄôHippolyte, qui, tr√®s loin, au premier √©tage, frottait une pi√®ce. Puis, coup sur coup, il re√ßut deux d√©p√™ches, la premi√®re annon√ßant l‚Äôenvahissement de Jean-Bart par la bande de Montsou, la seconde racontant les c√¢bles coup√©s, les feux renvers√©s, tout le ravage. Il ne comprit pas. Qu‚Äôest-ce que les gr√©vistes √©taient all√©s faire chez Deneulin, au lieu de s‚Äôattaquer √† une fosse de la Compagnie ? Du reste, ils pouvaient bien saccager Vandame, cela m√ªrissait le plan de conqu√™te qu‚Äôil m√©ditait. Et, √† midi, il d√©jeuna, seul dans la vaste salle, servi en silence par le domestique, dont il n‚Äôentendait m√™me pas les pantoufles. Cette solitude assombrissait encore ses pr√©occupations, il se sentait froid au c≈ìur, lorsqu‚Äôun porion, venu au pas de course, fut introduit et lui conta la marche de la bande sur Mirou. Presque aussit√¥t, comme il achevait son caf√©, un t√©l√©gramme lui apprit que Madeleine et Cr√®vec≈ìur √©taient menac√©s √† leur tour. Alors, sa perplexit√© devint extr√™me. Il attendait le courrier √† deux heures : devait-il tout de suite demander des troupes ? valait-il mieux patienter, de fa√ßon √† ne pas agir avant de conna√Ætre les ordres de la R√©gie ? Il retourna dans son cabinet, il voulut lire une note qu‚Äôil avait pri√© N√©grel de r√©diger la veille pour le pr√©fet. Mais il ne put mettre la main dessus, il r√©fl√©chit que peut-√™tre le jeune homme l‚Äôavait laiss√©e dans sa chambre, o√π il √©crivait souvent la nuit. Et, sans prendre de d√©cision, poursuivi par l‚Äôid√©e de cette note, il monta vivement la chercher, dans la chambre.
En entrant, M. Hennebeau eut une surprise : la chambre n‚Äô√©tait pas faite, sans doute un oubli ou une paresse d‚ÄôHippolyte. Il r√©gnait l√† une chaleur moite, la chaleur enferm√©e de toute une nuit, alourdie par la bouche du calorif√®re, rest√©e ouverte ; et il fut pris aux narines, il suffoqua dans un parfum p√©n√©trant, qu‚Äôil crut √™tre l‚Äôodeur des eaux de toilette, dont la cuvette se trouvait pleine. Un grand d√©sordre encombrait la pi√®ce, des v√™tements √©pars, des serviettes mouill√©es jet√©es aux dossiers des si√®ges, le lit b√©ant, un drap arrach√©, tra√Ænant jusque sur le tapis. D‚Äôailleurs, il n‚Äôeut d‚Äôabord qu‚Äôun regard distrait, il s‚Äô√©tait dirig√© vers une table couverte de papiers, et il y cherchait la note introuvable. Deux fois, il examina les papiers un √† un, elle n‚Äôy √©tait d√©cid√©ment pas. O√π diable cet √©cervel√© de Paul avait-il bien pu la fourrer ?
Et, comme M. Hennebeau revenait au milieu de la chambre en donnant un coup d‚Äô≈ìil sur chaque meuble, il aper√ßut, dans le lit ouvert, un point vif, qui luisait pareil √† une √©tincelle. Il s‚Äôapprocha machinalement, envoya la main. C‚Äô√©tait, entre deux plis du drap, un petit flacon d‚Äôor. Tout de suite, il avait reconnu un flacon de madame Hennebeau, le flacon d‚Äô√©ther qui ne la quittait jamais. Mais il ne s‚Äôexpliquait pas la pr√©sence de cet objet : comment pouvait-il √™tre dans le lit de Paul ? Et, soudain, il bl√™mit affreusement. Sa femme avait couch√© l√†.
- Pardon, murmura la voix d‚ÄôHippolyte au travers de la porte, j‚Äôai vu monter monsieur‚Ä¶
Le domestique √©tait entr√©, le d√©sordre de la chambre le consterna.
- Mon Dieu ! c‚Äôest vrai, la chambre qui n‚Äôest pas faite ! Aussi Rose est sortie en me l√¢chant tout le m√©nage sur le dos !
Hennebeau avait cach√© le flacon dans sa main, et il le serrait √† le briser.
- Que voulez-vous ?
- Monsieur, c‚Äôest encore un homme‚Ä¶ Il arrive de Cr√®vec≈ìur, il a une lettre.
- Bien ! laissez-moi, dites-lui d‚Äôattendre.
Sa femme avait couch√© l√† ! Quand il eut pouss√© le verrou, il rouvrit la main, il regarda le flacon, qui s‚Äô√©tait marqu√© en rouge dans sa chair. Brusquement, il voyait, il entendait, cette ordure se passait chez lui depuis des mois. Il se rappelait son ancien soup√ßon, les fr√¥lements contre les portes, les pieds nus s‚Äôen allant la nuit par la maison silencieuse. Oui, c‚Äô√©tait sa femme qui montait coucher l√† !
Tomb√© sur une chaise, en face du lit qu‚Äôil contemplait fixement, il demeura de longues minutes comme assomm√©. Un bruit le r√©veilla, on frappait √† la porte, on essayait d‚Äôouvrir. Il reconnut la voix du domestique.
- Monsieur‚Ä¶ Ah ! monsieur s‚Äôest enferm√©‚Ä¶
- Quoi encore ?
- Il para√Æt que √ßa presse, les ouvriers cassent tout. Deux autres hommes sont en bas. Il y a aussi des d√©p√™ches.
- Fichez-moi la paix ! dans un instant !
L‚Äôid√©e qu‚ÄôHippolyte aurait d√©couvert lui-m√™me le flacon, s‚Äôil avait fait la chambre le matin, venait de le glacer. Et, d‚Äôailleurs, ce domestique devait savoir, il avait trouv√© vingt fois le lit chaud encore de l‚Äôadult√®re, des cheveux de madame tra√Ænant sur l‚Äôoreiller, des traces abominables souillant les linges. S‚Äôil s‚Äôacharnait √† le d√©ranger, c‚Äô√©tait m√©chamment. Peut-√™tre √©tait-il demeur√© l‚Äôoreille coll√© √† la porte, excit√© par la d√©bauche de ses ma√Ætres.
Alors, M. Hennebeau ne bougea plus. Il regardait toujours le lit. Le long pass√© de souffrance se d√©roulait, son mariage avec cette femme, leur malentendu imm√©diat de c≈ìur et de chair, les amants qu‚Äôelle avait eus sans qu‚Äôil s‚Äôen dout√¢t, celui qu‚Äôil lui avait tol√©r√© pendant dix ans, comme on tol√®re un go√ªt immonde √† une malade. Puis, c‚Äô√©tait leur arriv√©e √† Montsou, un espoir fou de la gu√©rir, des mois d‚Äôalanguissement, d‚Äôexil ensommeill√©, l‚Äôapproche de la vieillesse qui allait enfin la lui rendre. Puis, leur neveu d√©barquait, ce Paul dont elle devenait la m√®re, auquel elle parlait de son c≈ìur mort, enterr√© sous la cendre √† jamais. Et, mari imb√©cile, il ne pr√©voyait rien, il adorait cette femme qui √©tait la sienne, que des hommes avaient eue, que lui seul ne pouvait avoir ! Il l‚Äôadorait d‚Äôune passion honteuse, au point de tomber √† genoux, si elle avait bien voulu lui donner le reste des autres ! Le reste des autres, elle le donnait √† cet enfant.
Un coup de timbre lointain, √† ce moment, fit tressaillir M. Hennebeau. Il le reconnut, c‚Äô√©tait le coup que l‚Äôon frappait, d‚Äôapr√®s ses ordres, lorsque arrivait le facteur. Il se leva, il parla √† voix haute, dans un flot de grossi√®ret√©, dont sa gorge douloureuse crevait malgr√© lui.
- Ah ! je m‚Äôen fous ! ah ! je m‚Äôen fous, de leurs d√©p√™ches et de leurs lettres !
Maintenant, une rage l‚Äôenvahissait, le besoin d‚Äôun cloaque, pour y enfoncer de telles salet√©s √† coups de talon. Cette femme √©tait une salope, il cherchait des mots crus, il en souffletait son image. L‚Äôid√©e brusque du mariage qu‚Äôelle poursuivait d‚Äôun sourire si tranquille entre C√©cile et Paul, acheva de l‚Äôexasp√©rer. Il n‚Äôy avait donc m√™me plus de passion, plus de jalousie, au fond de cette sensualit√© vivace ? Ce n‚Äô√©tait √† cette heure qu‚Äôun joujou pervers, l‚Äôhabitude de l‚Äôhomme, une r√©cr√©ation prise comme un dessert accoutum√©. Et il l‚Äôaccusait de tout, il innocentait presque l‚Äôenfant, auquel elle avait mordu, dans ce r√©veil d‚Äôapp√©tit, ainsi qu‚Äôon mord au premier fruit vert, vol√© sur la route. Qui mangerait-elle, jusqu‚Äôo√π tomberait-elle, quand elle n‚Äôaurait plus des neveux complaisants, assez pratiques pour accepter, dans leur famille, la table, le lit et la femme ?
On gratta timidement √† la porte, la voix d‚ÄôHippolyte se permit de souffler par le trou de la serrure :
- Monsieur, le courrier‚Ä¶ Et il y a aussi monsieur Dansaert qui est revenu, en disant qu‚Äôon s‚Äô√©gorge‚Ä¶
- Je descends, nom de Dieu !
Qu‚Äôallait-il leur faire ? les chasser √† leur retour de Marchiennes, comme des b√™tes puantes dont il ne voulait plus sous son toit. Il prendrait une trique, il leur crierait de porter ailleurs le poison de leur accouplement. C‚Äô√©tait de leurs soupirs, de leurs haleines confondues, dont s‚Äôalourdissait la ti√©deur moite de cette chambre ; l‚Äôodeur p√©n√©trante qui l‚Äôavait suffoqu√©, c‚Äô√©tait l‚Äôodeur de musc que la peau de sa femme exhalait, un autre go√ªt pervers, un besoin charnel de parfums violents ; et il retrouvait ainsi la chaleur, l‚Äôodeur de la fornication, l‚Äôadult√®re vivant, dans les pots qui tra√Ænaient, dans les cuvettes encore pleines, dans le d√©sordre des linges, des meubles, de la pi√®ce enti√®re, empest√©e de vice. Une fureur d‚Äôimpuissance le jeta sur le lit √† coups de poing, et il le massacra, et il laboura les places o√π il voyait l‚Äôempreinte de leurs deux corps, enrag√© des couvertures arrach√©es, des draps froiss√©s, mous et inertes sous ses coups, comme √©reint√©s eux-m√™mes des amours de toute la nuit.
Mais, brusquement, il crut entendre Hippolyte remonter. Une honte l‚Äôarr√™ta. Il resta un instant encore, haletant, √† s‚Äôessuyer le front, √† calmer les bonds de son c≈ìur. Debout devant une glace, il contemplait son visage, si d√©compos√©, qu‚Äôil ne le reconnaissait pas. Puis, quand il l‚Äôeut regard√© s‚Äôapaiser peu √† peu, par un effort de volont√© supr√™me, il descendit.
En bas, cinq messagers √©taient debout, sans compter Dansaert. Tous lui apportaient des nouvelles d‚Äôune gravit√© croissante sur la marche des gr√©vistes √† travers les fosses ; et le ma√Ætre-porion lui conta longuement ce qui s‚Äô√©tait pass√© √† Mirou, sauv√© par la belle conduite du p√®re Quandieu. Il √©coutait, hochait la t√™te ; mais il n‚Äôentendait pas, son esprit √©tait demeur√© l√†-haut, dans la chambre. Enfin, il les cong√©dia, il dit qu‚Äôil allait prendre des mesures. Lorsqu‚Äôil se retrouva seul, assis devant son bureau, il parut s‚Äôy assoupir, la t√™te entre les mains, les yeux couverts. Son courrier √©tait l√†, il se d√©cida √† y chercher la lettre attendue, la r√©ponse de la R√©gie, dont les lignes dans√®rent d‚Äôabord. Pourtant, il finit par comprendre que ces messieurs souhaitaient quelque bagarre : certes, ils ne lui commandaient pas d‚Äôempirer les choses ; mais ils laissaient percer que des troubles h√¢teraient le d√©nouement de la gr√®ve, en provoquant une r√©pression √©nergique. D√®s lors, il n‚Äôh√©sita plus, il lan√ßa des d√©p√™ches de tous c√¥t√©s, au pr√©fet de Lille, au corps de troupe de Douai, √† la gendarmerie de Marchiennes. C‚Äô√©tait un soulagement, il n‚Äôavait qu‚Äô√† s‚Äôenfermer, m√™me il fit r√©pandre la rumeur qu‚Äôil souffrait de la goutte. Et, toute l‚Äôapr√®s-midi, il se cacha au fond de son cabinet, ne recevant personne, se contentant de lire les d√©p√™ches et les lettres qui continuaient de pleuvoir. Il suivit ainsi de loin la bande, de Madeleine √† Cr√®vec≈ìur, de Cr√®vec≈ìur √† la Victoire, de la Victoire √† Gaston-Marie. D‚Äôautre part, des renseignements lui arrivaient sur l‚Äôeffarement des gendarmes et des dragons, √©gar√©s en route, tournant sans cesse le dos aux fosses attaqu√©es. On pouvait s‚Äô√©gorger et tout d√©truire, il avait remis la t√™te entre ses mains, les doigts sur les yeux, et il s‚Äôab√Æmait dans le grand silence de la maison vide, o√π il ne surprenait, par moments, que le bruit des casseroles de la cuisini√®re, en plein coup de feu, pour son d√Æner du soir.
Le cr√©puscule assombrissait d√©j√† la pi√®ce, il √©tait cinq heures, lorsqu‚Äôun vacarme fit sursauter M. Hennebeau, √©tourdi, inerte, les coudes toujours dans ses papiers. Il pensa que les deux mis√©rables rentraient. Mais le tumulte augmentait, un cri √©clata, terrible, √† l‚Äôinstant o√π il s‚Äôapprochait de la fen√™tre.
- Du pain ! du pain ! du pain !
C‚Äô√©taient les gr√©vistes qui envahissaient Montsou, pendant que les gendarmes, croyant √† une attaque sur le Voreux, galopaient, le dos tourn√©, pour occuper cette fosse.
Justement, √† deux kilom√®tres des premi√®res maisons, un peu en dessous du carrefour o√π se coupaient la grande route et le chemin de Vandame, madame Hennebeau et ces demoiselles venaient d‚Äôassister au d√©fil√© de la bande. La journ√©e √† Marchiennes s‚Äô√©tait pass√©e gaiement, un d√©jeuner aimable chez le directeur des Forges, puis une int√©ressante visite aux ateliers et √† une verrerie du voisinage, pour occuper l‚Äôapr√®s-midi ; et, comme on rentrait enfin, par ce d√©clin limpide d‚Äôun beau jour d‚Äôhiver, C√©cile avait eu la fantaisie de boire une tasse de lait, en apercevant une petite ferme, qui bordait la route. Toutes alors √©taient descendues de la cal√®che, N√©grel avait galamment saut√© de cheval ; pendant que la paysanne, effar√©e de ce beau monde, se pr√©cipitait, parlait de mettre une nappe, avant de servir. Mais Lucie et Jeanne voulaient voir traire le lait, on √©tait all√© dans l‚Äô√©table m√™me avec les tasses, on en avait fait une partie champ√™tre, riant beaucoup de la liti√®re o√π l‚Äôon enfon√ßait.
Madame Hennebeau, de son air de maternit√© complaisante, buvait du bout des l√®vres, lorsqu‚Äôun bruit √©trange, ronflant au dehors, l‚Äôinqui√©ta.
- Qu‚Äôest-ce donc ?
L‚Äô√©table, b√¢tie au bord de la route, avait une large porte charreti√®re, car elle servait en m√™me temps de grenier √† foin. D√©j√†, les jeunes filles, allongeant la t√™te, s‚Äô√©tonnaient de ce qu‚Äôelles distinguaient √† gauche, un flot noir, une cohue qui d√©bouchait en hurlant du chemin de Vandame.
- Diable ! murmura N√©grel, √©galement sorti, est-ce que nos braillards finiraient par se f√¢cher ?
- C‚Äôest peut-√™tre encore les charbonniers, dit la paysanne. Voil√† deux fois qu‚Äôils passent. Para√Æt que √ßa ne va pas bien, ils sont les ma√Ætres du pays.
Elle l√¢chait chaque mot avec prudence, elle en guettait l‚Äôeffet sur les visages ; et, quand elle remarqua l‚Äôeffroi de tous, la profonde anxi√©t√© o√π la rencontre les jetait, elle se h√¢ta de conclure :
- Oh ! les gueux, oh ! les gueux !
N√©grel, voyant qu‚Äôil √©tait trop tard pour remonter en voiture et gagner Montsou, donna l‚Äôordre au cocher de rentrer vivement la cal√®che dans la cour de la ferme, o√π l‚Äôattelage resta cach√© derri√®re un hangar. Lui-m√™me attacha sous ce hangar son cheval, dont un galopin avait tenu la bride. Lorsqu‚Äôil revint, il trouva sa tante et les jeunes filles √©perdues, pr√™tes √† suivre la paysanne, qui leur proposait de se r√©fugier chez elle. Mais il fut d‚Äôavis qu‚Äôon √©tait l√† plus en s√ªret√©, personne ne viendrait certainement les chercher dans ce foin. La porte charreti√®re, pourtant, fermait tr√®s mal, et elle avait de telles fentes, qu‚Äôon apercevait la route entre ses bois vermoulus.
- Allons, du courage ! dit-il. Nous vendrons notre vie ch√®rement.
Cette plaisanterie augmenta la peur. Le bruit grandissait, on ne voyait rien encore, et sur la route vide un vent de temp√™te semblait souffler, pareil √† ces rafales brusques qui pr√©c√®dent les grands orages.
- Non, non, je ne veux pas regarder, dit C√©cile en allant se blottir dans le foin.
Madame Hennebeau, tr√®s p√¢le, prise d‚Äôune col√®re contre ces gens qui g√¢taient un de ses plaisirs, se tenait en arri√®re, avec un regard oblique et r√©pugn√© ; tandis que Lucie et Jeanne, malgr√© leur tremblement, avaient mis un ≈ìil √† une fente, d√©sireuses de ne rien perdre du spectacle.
Le roulement de tonnerre approchait, la terre fut √©branl√©e, et Jeanlin galopa le premier, soufflant dans sa corne.
- Prenez vos flacons, la sueur du peuple qui passe ! murmura N√©grel, qui, malgr√© ses convictions r√©publicaines, aimait √† plaisanter la canaille avec les dames.
Mais son mot spirituel fut emport√© dans l‚Äôouragan des gestes et des cris. Les femmes avaient paru, pr√®s d‚Äôun millier de femmes, aux cheveux √©pars, d√©peign√©s par la course, aux guenilles montrant la peau nue, des nudit√©s de femelles lasses d‚Äôenfanter des meurt-de-faim. Quelques-unes tenaient leur petit entre les bras, le soulevaient, l‚Äôagitaient, ainsi qu‚Äôun drapeau de deuil et de vengeance. D‚Äôautres, plus jeunes, avec des gorges gonfl√©es de guerri√®res, brandissaient des b√¢tons ; tandis que les vieilles, affreuses, hurlaient si fort, que les cordes de leurs cous d√©charn√©s semblaient se rompre. Et les hommes d√©boul√®rent ensuite, deux mille furieux, des galibots, des haveurs, des raccommodeurs, une masse compacte qui roulait d‚Äôun seul bloc, serr√©e, confondue, au point qu‚Äôon ne distinguait ni les culottes d√©teintes, ni les tricots de laine en loques, effac√©s dans la m√™me uniformit√© terreuse. Les yeux br√ªlaient, on voyait seulement les trous des bouches noires, chantant la Marseillaise, dont les strophes se perdaient en un mugissement confus, accompagn√© par le claquement des sabots sur la terre dure. Au-dessus des t√™tes, parmi le h√©rissement des barres de fer, une hache passa, port√©e toute droite ; et cette hache unique, qui √©tait comme l‚Äô√©tendard de la bande, avait, dans le ciel clair, le profil aigu d‚Äôun couperet de guillotine.
- Quels visages atroces ! balbutia madame Hennebeau.
N√©grel dit entre ses dents :
- Le diable m‚Äôemporte si j‚Äôen reconnais un seul ! D‚Äôo√π sortent-ils donc, ces bandits-l√† ?
Et, en effet, la col√®re, la faim, ces deux mois de souffrance et cette d√©bandade enrag√©e au travers des fosses, avaient allong√© en m√¢choires de b√™tes fauves les faces placides des houilleurs de Montsou. √Ä ce moment, le soleil se couchait, les derniers rayons, d‚Äôun pourpre sombre, ensanglantaient la plaine. Alors, la route sembla charrier du sang, les femmes, les hommes continuaient √† galoper, saignants comme des bouchers en pleine tuerie.
- Oh ! Superbe ! dirent √† demi-voix Lucie et Jeanne, remu√©es dans leur go√ªt d‚Äôartistes par cette belle horreur.
Elles s‚Äôeffrayaient pourtant, elles recul√®rent pr√®s de madame Hennebeau, qui s‚Äô√©tait appuy√©e sur une auge. L‚Äôid√©e qu‚Äôil suffisait d‚Äôun regard, entre les planches de cette porte disjointe, pour qu‚Äôon les massacr√¢t, la gla√ßait. N√©grel se sentait bl√™mir, lui aussi, tr√®s brave d‚Äôordinaire, saisi l√† d‚Äôune √©pouvante sup√©rieure √† sa volont√©, une de ces √©pouvantes qui soufflent de l‚Äôinconnu. Dans le foin, C√©cile ne bougeait plus. Et les autres, malgr√© leur d√©sir de d√©tourner les yeux, ne le pouvaient pas, regardaient quand m√™me.
C‚Äô√©tait la vision rouge de la r√©volution qui les emporterait tous, fatalement, par une soir√©e sanglante de cette fin de si√®cle. Oui, un soir, le peuple l√¢ch√©, d√©brid√©, galoperait ainsi sur les chemins ; et il ruissellerait du sang des bourgeois. Il prom√®nerait des t√™tes, il s√®merait l‚Äôor des coffres √©ventr√©s. Les femmes hurleraient, les hommes auraient ces m√¢choires de loups, ouvertes pour mordre. Oui, ce seraient les m√™mes guenilles, le m√™me tonnerre de gros sabots, la m√™me cohue effroyable, de peau sale, d‚Äôhaleine empest√©e, balayant le vieux monde, sous leur pouss√©e d√©bordante de barbares. Des incendies flamberaient, on ne laisserait pas debout une pierre des villes, on retournerait √† la vie sauvage dans les bois, apr√®s le grand rut, la grande ripaille, o√π les pauvres, en une nuit, efflanqueraient les femmes et videraient les caves des riches. Il n‚Äôy aurait plus rien, plus un sou des fortunes, plus un titre des situations acquises, jusqu‚Äôau jour o√π une nouvelle terre repousserait peut-√™tre. Oui, c‚Äô√©taient ces choses qui passaient sur la route, comme une force de la nature, et ils en recevaient le vent terrible au visage.
Un grand cri s‚Äô√©leva, domina la Marseillaise :
- Du pain ! du pain ! du pain !
Lucie et Jeanne se serr√®rent contre madame Hennebeau, d√©faillante ; tandis que N√©grel se mettait devant elles, comme pour les prot√©ger de son corps. √âtait-ce donc ce soir m√™me que l‚Äôantique soci√©t√© craquait ? Et ce qu‚Äôils virent, alors, acheva de les h√©b√©ter. La bande s‚Äô√©coulait, il n‚Äôy avait plus que la queue des tra√Ænards, lorsque la Mouquette d√©boucha. Elle s‚Äôattardait, elle guettait les bourgeois, sur les portes de leurs jardins, aux fen√™tres de leurs maisons ; et, quand elle en d√©couvrait, ne pouvant leur cracher au nez, elle leur montrait ce qui √©tait pour elle le comble de son m√©pris. Sans doute elle en aper√ßut un, car brusquement elle releva ses jupes, tendit les fesses, montra son derri√®re √©norme, nu dans un dernier flamboiement du soleil. Il n‚Äôavait rien d‚Äôobsc√®ne, ce derri√®re, et ne faisait pas rire, farouche.
Tout disparut, le flot roulait sur Montsou, le long des lacets de la route, entre les maisons basses, bariol√©es de couleurs vives. On fit sortir la cal√®che de la cour, mais le cocher n‚Äôosait prendre sur lui de ramener madame et ces demoiselles sans encombre, si les gr√©vistes tenaient le pav√©. Et le pis √©tait qu‚Äôil n‚Äôy avait pas d‚Äôautre chemin.
- Il faut pourtant que nous rentrions, le d√Æner nous attend, dit madame Hennebeau, hors d‚Äôelle, exasp√©r√©e par la peur. Ces sales ouvriers ont encore choisi un jour o√π j‚Äôai du monde. Allez donc faire du bien √† √ßa !
Lucie et Jeanne s‚Äôoccupaient √† retirer du foin C√©cile, qui se d√©battait, croyant que ces sauvages d√©filaient sans cesse, et r√©p√©tant qu‚Äôelle ne voulait pas voir. Enfin, toutes reprirent place dans la voiture. N√©grel, remont√© √† cheval, eut alors l‚Äôid√©e de passer par les ruelles de R√©quillart.
- Marchez doucement, dit-il au cocher, car le chemin est atroce. Si des groupes vous emp√™chent de revenir √† la route, l√†-bas, vous vous arr√™terez derri√®re la vieille fosse, et nous rentrerons √† pied par la petite porte du jardin, tandis que vous remiserez la voiture et les chevaux n‚Äôimporte o√π, sous le hangar d‚Äôune auberge.
Ils partirent. La bande, au loin, ruisselait dans Montsou. Depuis qu‚Äôils avaient vu, √† deux reprises, des gendarmes et des dragons, les habitants s‚Äôagitaient, affol√©s de panique. Il circulait des histoires abominables, on parlait d‚Äôaffiches manuscrites, mena√ßant les bourgeois de leur crever le ventre ; personne ne les avait lues, on n‚Äôen citait pas moins des phrases textuelles. Chez le notaire surtout, la terreur √©tait √† son comble, car il venait de recevoir par la poste une lettre anonyme, o√π on l‚Äôavertissait qu‚Äôun baril de poudre se trouvait enterr√© dans sa cave, pr√™t √† le faire sauter, s‚Äôil ne se d√©clarait pas en faveur du peuple.
Justement, les Gr√©goire, attard√©s dans leur visite par l‚Äôarriv√©e de cette lettre, la discutaient, la devinaient l‚Äô≈ìuvre d‚Äôun farceur, lorsque l‚Äôinvasion de la bande acheva d‚Äô√©pouvanter la maison. Eux, souriaient. Ils regardaient, en √©cartant le coin d‚Äôun rideau, et se refusaient √† admettre un danger quelconque, certains, disaient-ils, que tout finirait √† l‚Äôamiable. Cinq heures sonnaient, ils avaient le temps d‚Äôattendre que le pav√© f√ªt libre pour aller, en face, d√Æner chez les Hennebeau, o√π C√©cile, rentr√©e s√ªrement, devait les attendre. Mais, dans Montsou, personne ne semblait partager leur confiance : des gens √©perdus couraient, les portes et les fen√™tres se fermaient violemment. Ils aper√ßurent Maigrat, de l‚Äôautre c√¥t√© de la route, qui barricadait son magasin, √† grand renfort de barres de fer, si p√¢le et si tremblant, que sa petite femme ch√©tive √©tait forc√©e de serrer les √©crous.
La bande avait fait halte devant l‚Äôh√¥tel du directeur, le cri retentissait :
- Du pain ! du pain ! du pain !
M. Hennebeau √©tait debout √† la fen√™tre, lorsque Hippolyte entra fermer les volets, de peur que les vitres ne fussent cass√©es √† coups de pierre. Il ferma de m√™me tous ceux du rez-de-chauss√©e ; puis, il passa au premier √©tage, on entendit les grincements des espagnolettes, les claquements des persiennes, un √† un. Par malheur, on ne pouvait clore de m√™me la baie de la cuisine, dans le sous-sol, une baie inqui√©tante o√π rougeoyaient les feux des casseroles et de la broche.
Machinalement, M. Hennebeau, qui voulait voir, remonta au second √©tage, dans la chambre de Paul : c‚Äô√©tait la mieux plac√©e, √† gauche, car elle permettait d‚Äôenfiler la route, jusqu‚Äôaux Chantiers de la Compagnie. Et il se tint derri√®re la persienne, dominant la foule. Mais cette chambre l‚Äôavait saisi de nouveau, la table de toilette √©pong√©e et en ordre, le lit froid, aux draps nets et bien tir√©s. Toute sa rage de l‚Äôapr√®s-midi, cette furieuse bataille au fond du grand silence de sa solitude, aboutissait maintenant √† une immense fatigue. Son √™tre √©tait d√©j√† comme cette chambre, refroidi, balay√© des ordures du matin, rentr√© dans la correction d‚Äôusage. √Ä quoi bon un scandale ? est-ce que rien √©tait chang√© chez lui ? Sa femme avait simplement un amant de plus, cela aggravait √† peine le fait, qu‚Äôelle l‚Äôe√ªt choisi dans la famille ; et peut-√™tre m√™me y avait-il avantage, car elle sauvegardait ainsi les apparences. Il se prenait en piti√©, au souvenir de sa folie jalouse. Quel ridicule, d‚Äôavoir assomm√© ce lit √† coups de poing ! Puisqu‚Äôil avait tol√©r√© un autre homme, il tol√©rerait bien celui-l√†. Ce ne serait que l‚Äôaffaire d‚Äôun peu de m√©pris encore. Une amertume affreuse lui empoisonnait la bouche, l‚Äôinutilit√© de tout, l‚Äô√©ternelle douleur de l‚Äôexistence, la honte de lui-m√™me, qui adorait et d√©sirait toujours cette femme, dans la salet√© o√π il l‚Äôabandonnait.
Sous la fen√™tre, les hurlements √©clat√®rent avec un redoublement de violence.
- Du pain ! du pain ! du pain !
- Imb√©ciles ! dit M. Hennebeau entre ses dents serr√©es.
Il les entendait l‚Äôinjurier √† propos de ses gros appointements, le traiter de fain√©ant et de ventru, de sale cochon qui se foutait des indigestions de bonnes choses, quand l‚Äôouvrier crevait la faim. Les femmes avaient aper√ßu la cuisine, et c‚Äô√©tait une temp√™te d‚Äôimpr√©cations contre le faisan qui r√¥tissait, contre les sauces dont l‚Äôodeur grasse ravageait leurs estomacs vides. Ah ! ces salauds de bourgeois, on leur en collerait du champagne et des truffes, pour se faire p√©ter les tripes.
- Du pain ! du pain ! du pain !
- Imb√©ciles ! r√©p√©ta M. Hennebeau, est-ce que je suis heureux ?
Une col√®re le soulevait contre ces gens qui ne comprenaient pas. Il leur en aurait fait cadeau volontiers, de ses gros appointements, pour avoir, comme eux, le cuir dur, l‚Äôaccouplement facile et sans regret. Que ne pouvait-il les asseoir √† sa table, les emp√¢ter de son faisan, tandis qu‚Äôil s‚Äôen irait forniquer derri√®re les haies, culbuter des filles, en se moquant de ceux qui les avaient culbut√©es avant lui ! Il aurait tout donn√©, son √©ducation, son bien-√™tre, son luxe, sa puissance de directeur, s‚Äôil avait pu √™tre, une journ√©e, le dernier des mis√©rables qui lui ob√©issaient, libre de sa chair, assez goujat pour gifler sa femme et prendre du plaisir sur les voisines. Et il souhaitait aussi de crever la faim, d‚Äôavoir le ventre vide, l‚Äôestomac tordu de crampes √©branlant le cerveau d‚Äôun vertige : peut-√™tre cela aurait-il tu√© l‚Äô√©ternelle douleur. Ah ! vivre en brute, ne rien poss√©der √† soi, battre les bl√©s avec la herscheuse la plus laide, la plus sale, et √™tre capable de s‚Äôen contenter !
- Du pain ! du pain ! du pain !
Alors, il se f√¢cha, il cria furieusement dans le vacarme :
- Du pain ! est-ce que √ßa suffit, imb√©ciles ?
Il mangeait, lui, et il n‚Äôen r√¢lait pas moins de souffrance. Son m√©nage ravag√©, sa vie enti√®re endolorie, lui remontaient √† la gorge, en un hoquet de mort. Tout n‚Äôallait pas pour le mieux parce qu‚Äôon avait du pain. Quel √©tait l‚Äôidiot qui mettait le bonheur de ce monde dans le partage de la richesse ? Ces songe-creux de r√©volutionnaires pouvaient bien d√©molir la soci√©t√© et en reb√¢tir une autre, ils n‚Äôajouteraient pas une joie √† l‚Äôhumanit√©, ils ne lui retireraient pas une peine, en coupant √† chacun sa tartine. M√™me ils √©largiraient le malheur de la terre, ils feraient un jour hurler jusqu‚Äôaux chiens de d√©sespoir, lorsqu‚Äôils les auraient sortis de la tranquille satisfaction des instincts, pour les hausser √† la souffrance inassouvie des passions. Non, le seul bien √©tait de ne pas √™tre, et, si l‚Äôon √©tait, d‚Äô√™tre l‚Äôarbre, d‚Äô√™tre la pierre, moins encore, le grain de sable, qui ne peut saigner sous le talon des passants.
Et, dans cette exasp√©ration de son tourment, des larmes gonfl√®rent les yeux de M. Hennebeau, crev√®rent en gouttes br√ªlantes le long de ses joues. Le cr√©puscule noyait la route, lorsque des pierres commenc√®rent √† cribler la fa√ßade de l‚Äôh√¥tel. Sans col√®re maintenant contre ces affam√©s, enrag√© seulement par la plaie cuisante de son c≈ìur, il continuait √† b√©gayer au milieu de ses larmes :
- Les imb√©ciles ! les imb√©ciles !
Mais le cri du ventre domina, un hurlement souffla en temp√™te, balayant tout.
- Du pain ! du pain ! du pain !Embed",fr,1 star,0.10211113840341568,2 stars,0.19046013057231903

Les bistros bourdonnent
L'assenceur qui brumme
Mais je m'en fou pas mal des choses de la rue
Donne moi plut√¥t un savon qui mousse

Someday, when I'm awfully low
When the world is cold
I will feel a glow just thinking of you
And the way you look tonight

Oh, but you're lovely with your smile so warm
And your cheek so soft
There is nothing for me but to love you
Just the way you look tonight

With each word, your tenderness grows
Tearing my fear apart
And that laugh that wrinkles your nose
Touches my foolish heart

Lovely, never, never change
Keep that breathless charm

Bluegrass and String Band Music
Bluegrass and string band music has one of the most fiercely loyal audiences in American music.  Followers don't look at it so much as entertainment as they do a way of life.  You'll frequently see the makeup of these bands are family members, and many make it their life's work.  That kind of devotion says a lot about the values they see in the music. Whether it's history and tradition they hear, or that they hear it as a true expression of Americana, the performers and their audiences are passionate. You'll find a great presentation of this in a thesis by Leslie Blake Price entitled Bluegrass Nation: A Historical and Cultural Analysis of America's Truest Music.
Any discussion of country or bluegrass music must acknow-ledge the contributions of the Carter Family.  They were one of the most influential groups in country music history, and they moved the emphasis from hillbilly instrumentals to ""folk stories in song"".  The original group consisted of A.P., his wife Sara, and her sister Maybelle.  They influenced all that followed in country and folk music, from Woody Guthrie, Pete Seeger and Doc Watson all the way up to Bob Dylan, Emmylou Harris and Ketch Secor.
It's unlikely that bluegrass music would exist today without the Carter Family's contributions. A.P. collected hundreds of Appalachian folk songs and rearranged them into the classics we have today.  They recorded hundreds of songs. but ""Will the Circle Be Unbroken"", ""Wildwood Flower"", and ""Keep on the Sunny Side"" will give you a good sense of what their music did to build the folk tradition in country music.
That foundation work was built-up by those who followed.  In bluegrass, there are no better examples of where we are today today than Earl Skruggs' ""Foggy Mountain Breakdown"", the Foggy Mountain Boys' ""Rollin' in My Sweet Baby's Arms"" or the Osborne Brothers' ""Rocky Top"", but here is a short list of more recent (and also great) examples of bluegrass and string music:Old Crow Medicine Show's ""Sweet Amarillo""The SteelDrivers' ""Wearin' a Hole""The Grascals' ""Old Friend of Mine""Dailey & Vincent's ""Take Me Back (And Leave Me There)""Aly Bain, Jerry Douglas and Russ Barenberg's
""St. Anne's Reel""Wilson Banjo Company's ""95 Years""Yonder Mountain String Band's ""Alison""Top Ten Music Shrines in Tennessee

Far far, there was this little girl
She was praying for something to happen to her
Everyday she writes words and more words
Just to speak out the thoughts that keep floating inside
And she's strong when the dreams come
Cause they take her, cover her, they are all over
The reality looks far now, but don't go

How can you stay outside?
There's a beautiful mess inside
How can you stay outside?
There's a beautiful mess inside, oh

Far, far there was this little girl
She was praying for something good to happen to her
From time to time there are colors and shapes
Dazzling her eyes, tickling her hands
They invent her a new world with
Oil skies and aquarel rivers
But don't you run away already
Please don't go

How can you stay outside?
There's a beautiful mess inside
How can you stay outside?
There's a beautiful mess inside
Take a deep breath and dive
There's a beautiful mess inside
How can you stay outside?
There's a beautiful mess, beautiful mess inside
Beautiful, beautiful

Far far, there was this little girl
She was praying for something big to happen to her
Every night she hears beautiful strange music
It's everywhere, there's nowhere to hide
But if it fades she begs, ""Oh Lord, don't take it from me
Don't take it yourselves""
I guess I'll have to give it birth, to give it birth
I guess, I guess I have to give it birth
I guess I have to, have to give it birth
There's a beautiful mess inside and it's everywhere
So shake it yourself now deep inside
Deeper than you ever dared

The loveliness of Paris seems somehow sadly gay
The glory that was Rome is of another day
I've been terribly alone and forgotten in Manhattan
I'm going home to my city by the Bay

I left my heart in San Francisco
High on a hill, it calls to me
To be where little cable cars climb halfway to the stars
The morning fog may chill the air, I don't care

My love waits there in San Francisco
Above the blue and windy sea

Got as far as the door
They have asked me about you

But nevertheless, why stir up memories?

Been invited on dates
Might have gone, but what for?
Awfully different without you

Madame with you

My heart won't let my feet
Do things they should do
You know what? You're lovely
And so what? I'm lovely
But, oh, what'd you do to me?
I'm like an ocean wave that's bumped on the shore
I feel so absolutely stumped on the floor

When you dance
You're charming and you're gentle
Especially when we do the continental
But this feeling isn't purely mental
For heaven rest us
We're not asbestos
And that's why

They all laughed at Christopher Columbus
When he said the world was round
They all laughed when Edison recorded sound
They all laughed at Wilbur and his brother
When they said, man could fly
They told Marconi wireless was a phony
It's the same old cry

They laughed at me wanting you
Said I was reaching for the moon
But, oh, you came through
Now they'll have to change their tune

They all said we never could happy
They laughed at us and how
Ho, ho, ho
Who's got the last laugh now?

They all laughed at Rockefeller Center

They all laughed at Whitney and his cotton gin

I used to visit all the very gay places
Those come what may places
Where one relaxes on the axis of the wheel of life
To get the feel of life
From jazz and cocktails
The girls I knew had sad and sullen gray faces
With distingu√© traces
That used to be there you could see where
They'd been washed away
By too many through the day
Twelve o'clock tales

Then you came along with your siren song
To tempt me to madness
I thought for a while that your poignant smile
Was tinged with the sadness
Of a great love for me
Ah, yes, I was wrong
Again I was wrong

Life is lonely again
And only last year
Everything seemed so sure
Now life is awful again
A troughful of hearts
Could only be a bore

A week in Paris could ease the bite of it
All I care is to smile in spite of it
I'll forget you I will
And yet you are still
Burning inside my brain
Romance is mush
Stifling those who strive
I'll live a lush
Life in some small dive

And there I'll be
While I rot with the rest

They say into your early life, romance came
And in this heart of yours, burned a flame
A flame that flickered one day
And died away

Then with disillusion deep in your eyes
You learned that fools in love soon grow wise
The years have changed you somehow
I see you now

Smoking, drinking, never thinking of tomorrow
Nonchalant, diamonds shining, dancing, dining
With some man in a restaurant
Is that all you really want?

Sophisticated lady
I know you miss the love you lost long ago
And when nobody is nigh, you cry, mm

Love is funny, or it's sad
Or it's quiet, or it's mad
It's a good thing, or it's bad
But beautiful, beautiful
To take a chance and if you fall, you fall
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all

Love is tearful, or it's gay
It's a problem, or it's play
It's a heartache either way
But beautiful
And I'm thinking if you were my mine I'd never let you go

I got bored with 4 beats to the measure
Professor Speech Compressor terminated his tenure to explore more rewarding adventure
Take a closer look at the bars
You'll see I'm not behind them or in front of them, I'm one of them
Started with a 100, the Game spit 3, I said, ""Fuck it
I'ma have to show these niggas something""
Too easy, who'd believe me if I said that it wasn't?
The rhyme is a weapon, I bust it, the Brotherhood got me covered
OP Orders with coordinates where to drop mortars
I drive forward, sandstorms make my eyes water
Skull is a submarine hull
Dolphin phones screen calls from places as far away as A.G.C.R
The rhymes are raw, deeper than yours
You crawled before you walked but didn't think about your thoughts before you talked
We spit for sport, I won you lost
But you paid them off to nail my corpse to a cross
This is 'The Greatest Rhyme of All Time' supposedly
1000 Bars it will probably always be
Mentally top heavy, not many can rock with me
Hip Hop could not bench me so they plot to suspend me
I said, ""Nobody benefits, everyone perishes""
I tell them this, they say, ""Here, it's time for your medicine""
Imagine being fined over a rhyme for stepping over the line
When I inspired Hova and Nas
I listened to 44 4's 22 times
I Gave You Power, God stop my heart if I'm lying
You like red or white wine? Let's talk about it I'm buying
Let's talk about the Children of Zion, excuse me if I start crying
The art of rhyming? I've mastered it certainly, surely
I'll celebrate capturing it for my taxidermy
From the streets of New Jersey to Germany
To the jungles of Angola where most the meat poachers heard of me
The Ice Truck Killer will be observing me perform surgery
Ritual widow murder, searching for her urgently
Mix the blood so it don't coagulate
The sex magik won't work if the bitch masturbates
I put her on Cloud 9, look at her face
A cumulus lenticularis, a capsule in space
You will become acquainted with my cryptic language
And my mystic manners, Rip spit bananas
Systematic global geographic systemic neosynapsis
Reload the graphics, notice I spit it rapid
Advanced Step in Innovative Mobility
Most MCs try to clone me lyrically
My cell chemistry is a mirror of who I am physically
But my true symmetry is energy
The Will of Claude Ashur
The skill of Germaine Father Author Poor Pauper Pastor, more than a rapper
My body is a human machine, my dreams filter in between
Just wait until I build my machine
Kill you with weed vapour, then a taser, then a laser
Then a maser, then a phaser, then something they call scalar
That is not dead which can eternally lie
And with strange aeons even death may die
But why? Coup de gr√¢ce for the coup d'√âtat
In a man made lodge the Moon rays replace God
I think I've had about enough of your tough talk
Come over here take my cuffs off, I promise you we'll just talk
No biting allowed, just bark, don't run, just walk
Battle Rap there is no such art
Emotion manifests thought, thought manifests words, actions and reality
This is not fantasy
If you question me, you will be detained indefinitely
Your name will be added to the Blacklist Registry
I'm a scruffy old man with bloody cold hands
On my arm is a tattoo of a sully old brand
If I am not myself, then how would I be?
If I do not look tell me how will I see?
The Law of Attraction is attracted to me
The laws of poetry in action is practiced quite actively
I look at my face more than anybody else
I still can't recognize myself
I don't need anybody but myself
When I'm rhyming like this I don't need no help
But, thank you for your purchase, these verses have perennial purpose
But on the other hand these rappers are worthless
At least from my interconnected introspective perspective
The more pretentious, the more apprehensive the sentence
You are lazy, you wanna be the best, you crazy
The best train every day of the week
My lyricism amplifies every letter written
Rip the Jacker spitting inside Zero Vector Systems
Brain waves reveal High Yield E&D Fields

My microphone was found where the Mayan Sun Stone was
The Period of Purification in my poems
Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome under red rock
It's no use if you can't use what you got

Your girl Gertrude promised me her servitude
She better do it, I don't wanna have to hurt you dude
I eat from the same portion as you
Just in case you try to poison my food but I want you to
A deer hunter all year if I could spare summers
Fucking your whore of a mother in front of her queer husband
Wide lens, wide mattress, she's an actress
This is Monster Ball practice, I'm Big Billy Bob Black Angus
You and I can sit and look at each other
Tossing knowledge back and forth like we was throwing books at each other

I don't care what you say nigga, you a nigga lover
All cultures come from One Mind
The Universe is not far behind ‚Äì waves, bars and rhymes
Motivated by the stars that shine
Only lower density life forms get lost in time
I don't care if I make history, I wanna be a part of Infinity
Look at what your Sun God did to me
I am energy, I am He spiritually and mentally
The fools who threw away my jewels offended me

The East Wing Isle goes on for five miles
More rappers than fans, more fans wrapped in vans
Hip Hop will continue to expand
Poets should be rappers, rappers should be lyricists
The current industry model collapse imminent
This is Hollywood Hip Hop
Celebrities adopt little snot nosed bugaboos from off the block

Poetically paralyzing, where are you? Are you hiding?
No! I am sandbag diving
Do not evade question
Please explain to your viewers how there are space weapons bigger than zeppelins
How is it so? Tell the people, they need to know
And if you don't think so, you're a talk show ho
The grown up who showed up drunk with his own cup stoned as fuck
Who could tell me that this poem is luck
You say I'm crazy, I say ""So, tell me something I don't know
Something my psyche profile doesn't show""
I don't have all the answers, I am not in the know
I can only see what is above and only from below
The substratum of reality through the thick cloud canopy
How can it be Canibus? Answer me!
I approached the podium and delivered my encomium
Nobody applauded, the atmosphere was ominous
They feared I would spit, they don't like when I bust
The mucus dried up to a pear like crust
From a very cold place called Faraday Base
Right next to the South Pole's longest ice strait
Food supply low, they speak of going above ground to find mo'
I cry out, ""No, do not go!
Where the fuck are you going?
400mph wind belts blowing, think for a moment
We got to wait it out, that's what the training's about
We have to survive, that's what Germaine is about""
Arctic geography is conducive to astronomy
And the study of celestial bodies, follow me
The sheer size of the academia implied by the rhymes
Lead them to believe I was lying
I blasted through the limestone with water mixed with a dissolver
Then I signalled the remaining cave crawlers
Dig a hole for the collateral carnage, battle the hardest
Take out Hip Hop's trash and garbage
Tunnel boring and jacking, water main tapping
I sat there drafting a new drainage plan, laughing
Tough, pliable, relatively reliable
The vocation of this undertaking is very viable
My lyrical is chemical radioactive residue
I can't rest until I accomplish what I was sent to do
The gross oversimplication of a Jamaican
In a basement tracing over diagrams for a tape deck
That evolved into a spaceship that hasn't been made yet
'Cause I haven't been paid yet, not even one pay check
I walked through the valley of humiliation
But Hip Hop started hating, I tried to save them, they wasn't patient
Responsibility entrusted
There's only one way for me to prove that I love it, that's why I'm busting
If you pursue revenge, dig many graves
Be sure to add your name to the list that you've made
Musically still producing, I got a couple new things cocooning
But Poet Laureate's my new shit
Distinguished English and sophisticated senses
In sync with the talisman I received from the temptress
With these lyrics I consecrate the spirit
Whenever I spit it, concentrate you can hear it
I've almost perfected this, I'm one word away from excellence
When I find it I'll begin testing it
The phenomenal beast, astronomer priest
When the poles shift the Sun will not rise from the East
Wilder than the wilderness
I'm 'bout to show you who wildebeest Williams is, you better be filming this
A blast so cataclysmic, it warps the time and space within it
The hours become minutes, the minutes become infinite lyrics
Poet Laureate spit from the spirit, from the Sirius Star system
To observe the gods
My thoughts graduated to the stars to Infinity, listen to the bars
The Kapellmeister in the battlegrinder created by King Osiris
My psychic wall larger than China's
The thirst to rhyme at first hurts like a laborious childbirth
And sounds like Chinese fireworks
Several million years into the past
The primitive future in a world without oil and gas
Focus on two standards when assessing the threat
Number 1 is capacity, Number 2 is intent
The flood was not an obstacle
I made a raft out of empty milk gallon bottles for survival
Always remember, meet me in Denver
Colorado Springs in the Vandenberg welcome center
Four and a half foot beings with big black eyes
Try to trap me and extract my rhymes all the time
I perform a requiem on the eve before Hip Hop ends
And make amends on behalf of my friends
Canibus grab the mic like an energized amulet
Then spit a rap that you can't forget
Oprah Winfrey don't like rap
All I got to say about that is she probably don't like black
I don't blame her, she don't understand it's only entertainment
She probably wouldn't feel different if she wasn't famous
She Traded Places  and her opinions started changing
As Randolph and Mortimer increased her wages
That alone could make a person racist, if not racist with colour?
Then material wise how we treat each other
The head of a lion, the legs of an eagle
The wings of a dragon, not the sigil, this is for real though
I sit down and think, when I write I can smell the ink
I bow before the desert wall of the Sphinx
The ideas have come from God, even I'm stunned
1000 Bars from the real Iron Lungs

I summon them, speaking in tongues again
Started with a trumpet, woodwinds, strings
The conductor brings the drums in, finger trigger the drum kit
Other MCs be nervous or something
Rhymes in abundance, Hip Hop justice, rappers are captured and punished
Drawn and quartered, liars are denied water, you still alive?

My skull is a submarine hull
Screen doors protect the motherboard core from extreme heat warp
My mind dives deep beneath yours
Poseidon trident seahorse bubbles form I scream with extreme force
Marinaras Trench detour to Ultima Thule, let me explain what my sonar saw
Upholding the Holy Rosary, patrolling the open seas at U-Boat speed

Co-signed by GlaxoSmithKline designs
The Universe provided the lighting to see what I was writing
The results were blinding, lyrics, timing
Shut the fuck up and stop whining
Instinct controls how you think before deciding, so keep vibing
Swimming naked in the open, a lone shark circles me
Instead of trying to murder me, it tried to flirt with me
I got away nervously, talked about it purposefully
Next time I see it, it's going to have a word with me
I guess it wasn't meant to be
Under an assumed identity I resumed PsyOps on the enemy

This lyrical pyramid was discovered by accident
I know I could build it faster if I block and tackle it
Judge me fairly
Compare me to Dante Alighieri's Purgatorio theory
Assigned to train and equip to spit who's ready?
I'll need a volunteer, do I have any?
Next year I'll get my SPINGS, a master space badge
After that I'll stop flying fixed wing aircraft
Most of you will never understand what I mean
My dreams are broken into storyboard scenes
Worm screw elevators descending to the bottom of the volcano crater
Inside the Devil's chamber
""That is not dead which can eternally lie

One ought not to think is what Rumsfeld thought
I'm a take you for a walk through a beautiful place called Honey Swamp
We'll shoot hoops at Mosquito Lagoon Park
The whirlpool of gravity traps me
Still allowing me to circle the M51 galaxy
Rap for me reduces the stress dramatically
Negative time produces antigravity
Inject the gas into the centrifuge mass
The Teleological Dynamic will enhance
Watch me wet up your weed then bust up you teeth
Make you run for your life like there's a bus up the street
The Dr. and I would meet at 29 palms Joshua street
I always had a lot to debrief
Killing my health, killing myself

Modifying the weather from behind a weather shield
Writing with a feathered quill, getting more ill

An asteroid field where every rock shaped like my seal

Starving in destitution, dying for retribution
Why would you wanna' blow a hospital? You stupid?

Polygraphs flutter, the Lovecraft craft lover
Quoting my favourite Inventor, ""I see excitement coming""
I raise my hand, lightening bolts stream from it
I see excitement coming, I see excitement coming
Unsatisfied, I decide to redefine rhyme
To create product of an applied mind
They say we're divided, I say we're small minded
Right after I said it I moved to a small island
There was no contingency plan given to me
Tell the motherfucker send his transcripts to me

Which one of us will sing Hail Mary?
Hip Hop supposed to be about endurance

I purchase the beat then mix my spit with the mercury
The DJ grabs the acetate out the crate
Mix the dub plate, the BPMs fluctuate
Nobody can hold me back, my flow bloviates to a spiritual shape
As I co-create rap, 30
Cold callous chronic chemical imbalance
Smoking a chalice in the Rabbit hole with Alice
The target appears in brackets, I attack it
Access then egress then quit this rap shit
Commander of the symphony when man meets ministry
Finishing my Archeogenetic Rap Facility
They can't battle me so they'd rather embarrass me
By being mad at me they commit microphone heresy
I am still the Master
As handsome as my unborn Grandson, Rip The Jacker
Call me grandpa, 40 as odd as it may seem
The microphone fiend is God of the Hip Hop regime
Planet Rock Supreme
Kill you with green Lasers, evaporated weed vapour, Electromagnetic Scalar
Then something they call a Maser
""That is not dead which can eternally lie
And with strange aeons even death may die""
Meteors fall from the sky, The Mars God looks at my eyes
Controlling my heart, controlling my mind
Oh Lord, Tell me what to do, Tell me oh Lord
I have mastered the art of rhyming I am so bored
My pain my joy my thoughts I've passed them on thru songs
Respond to me and I will answer to your call
Emotion manifests Thought, Thought manifests Words Actions & Reality
That's how it has to be
In front of me, on both sides and in back of me
I hear them talk about battling me in the whispering gallery
The chain of command blames the unseen hand
The Galactic Plane has a Galactic Plan
I look up in the sky to see if God is judging me
Suddenly I feel Fatima and Medjugorie come to me, 60
Sitting down at the mixing board/round/banquet table comfortably
They begin to study me, by showing me worlds I would love to see
My body did not melt beyond the Van Allen Belt
I was transformed into a spirit with no shell
I could move about freely, I rose & I fell
The coldness of heaven is like the coldness of hell
Metaphoric Sun Worship, pulling me with planet like inertias
Words blinking like the text edit cursor
My sentences are sometimes too sensitive to make sense of it
Layer upon layer upon layer unedited
You lazy & you wanna' be the best? You crazy!
The Best Train EVERYDAY of the week
Propulsion system is gravity driven, white hot thermal
External vision, every lyric got a wormhole in it
Saint Germaine is real, Germaine is a sage for real
My sigil is the double headed eagle seal
Normal life is not real, we are cogs in a wheel
We work we hurt we search we feel
The microphonist that utilizes the study of Conics
Circular motion in both the para- and the hyperbolas
Tiger Woods knows this, everytime he plays golf he shows this
A true master at the masters in focus
In my time of need, I am not alone
I was told in a dream by Cthulhu from his tomb
Try to hurt me, I'll murder you, lay you down vertical
Made your life purposeful, germinated the earth with you
My black goggles, are covered with Bat Guano
I'll hang from the ceiling and watch you, act hostile I'll pop you
Rap Music and those who listen to it don't owe me nothing
I don't want nothing from you, not even your judgement
The Philosophic maverick the massive knowledge magnet
Underwater sea lilies are the source of my magic
Matricidal motherfucker homicidal hustler
Filibuster, never been a Wikipedia lover
If I were you I wouldn't waste time reading that rubbish
It might turn you into a media puppet, but fuck it
Leviathan divides the suspect zero sign
Therefore I rhyme for all time
Metaphor and Rhyme is poetry by design
But poetry continues outside the timeline
Unnatural battle ability, the enemy tried to imprison me
But they would've been better off killing me
Theoretically Shiaperrelli has mentored me
With motifs of illuminated speech and wizardry
Over The Horizon Radar Rhymes
Patent number 4686605
Sound pours out of the ground across the land
Jethro Tull was mauled by the god called Pan
Creative writing and rhythm, grammar and composition
Don't ignore me, ignore the fool who tells you not to listen
To you it shouldn't sound like I'm quitting cause I'm not
If I am to continue it's up to Hip Hop
Weary of body and mind, tired of swimming against the tide
Why swim or walk when I can glide?
Zero Gravity exercising, requires expert timing, for sky diving
My call sign is Flying Wing
An impossible profession
St. Germaine was made to explain the lesson with a 1000 Bar message
Now you may go
You have graduated, now you may know
Tell the world exactly what you were shown
Sho nuff, sesame street poems brought to you by Sears Roebuck
Countdown 48 more months
Does it amaze me? ""NO!"" Does it phase me? maybe a little yo
Gotta' find a way to generate doe
Promoter won't pay me what I want for a show
Why do it for free when I'm worth my weight in gold?
Mind Body & Soul inseparable, incredibly
Proto plasma recycles the matter perpetually
Hip Hop became boring, lyrics seem more like a vestigial organ
But they should be more important
The diaphragm, the thymus
Activate the latent powers that reside inside us with 13 chakras
You get the Guantanamo Bay, the Alcatraz way
You heard what I say? These pigs gotta' pay!
I steady my approach, this supposed to be a no fly zone
Black sheep squadron with strobe light hoes
The hurricane's eye's open
Gale winds blowing, Moses on a row boat floating in the ocean
I figured out, how to save water in a drought
If we save the right amount I know we can make it out
The ever expanding mind commanding body do you copy?
The quantum biology biopsy
My austere designs are so ahead of their time
Even when you press rewind your still left behind
Father Author Poor Pauper, breaths to draw Prana
In a yoga pose tryna get close to yo mama
Your ear cartilage has been targeted, The bombing will commence
Don't be a bitch nigga you started it
On the Sabbath I write preplanning for the Planet
Drawing mathematics, suspended in space as holographics
Scientifically quantifiable megalomaniacal
Viable style it's like trying to ride a bull
The lyrical inimical is miserable because I've built a citadel
Of syllables that made me invincible
Am I a mad man or a mason? A patriot or a pagan?
West Coasting in a 64 with Rose Gold Daytons
The propulsion system matrix is poorly calibrated
I'm waiting on the parts special order replacements
Battle Rap is just aimless entertainment
Second Round Knockout was one of they favourites, Fuck all the haters
My luck was crushed, I felt like they fronted
My heart kept pumping, I had to do something
I turned the page, wrote a turn of phrase
Verbal X-Rays, they say ""I don't burn I blaze""
Don't look at it like winning or losing, in '98 it was amusing
But Poet Laureate is my New Shit!
Time keep on slipping the Ripper keeps ripping
But right now my image stands still in a prism
My light reflects like a mirror, I choose to share it
The Precession of Earth is nearing, I'm preparing
Assessment and Planning things, should I put mustard on these sandwiches, a
Fathers job is so challenging
My pupil size increase, constriction and velocity decrease
You can't Emcee take a seat
What are you building Bis? Is it a flying Silver Disk?
If you ever leave you'll be missed
I tear thru the Galactic drift, I travel 10 digits in 10 minutes
Now that's some shit! You think that's fast? Nah....
That's faster than you think, By the time you blink, the whole Universe shrinks
A word to the wise, try to keep your eyes in the skies
And try to keep your ears on my rhymes
A magic reminder that the fire will not expire
Pyrus Sidonious gives me energy when I'm tired
The Sun is so bright my eyes hurt, I'm forced to look downward
Now I see inside the Earth
I Thank Mother Gaia for bearing us green grass
But it won't last we're killing her with greenhouse gas
You said ""the best shouldn't have to ask for respect""
Is that correct? Yes could you please speak up, I SAID YES!
I hold Hip Hop responsible
Every magazine writer that wrote bullshit in their articles
Gone 'til November? I'll be gone forever
I made these bars so you could ALL remember
The illest MC to put it all on the line
My career was crucified but I'm still alive
Sky scraper spaceships, wide crater dry lake beds
""resistance is futile"" they said
I bear clutch the pen, my girlfriends jealous again
So intimate when I write it's a sin, 200
My electromagnetic rap flytrap
There's no way Earth you can get around that
This is a no brainer, stop the complaining
If Hip Hop is dead I'm here to save it
Pages upon pages everything I've created
The bar was below basic, I had to raise it
I did it for my Fathers, I did it for my Mothers and my Brothers
I did it for the world to discover
My poetry is peaceful, aggressive but regal
Progressive to the people, I hope the words reach you 210
Dr. Watson and Crick found an 3rd strand in the DNA helix
So your not what you think
Metronome Man will never take commands from the drum
The beat is my slave and it will behave as I want
Cheers! I spill beer on my bear skin chairs
I shed tears I loved Hip Hop all these years
Poet Laureate Infinity
I WILL FOREVER BE THE ILLEST LYRICALLY!
Poet Laureate Infinity
Poet Laureate Infinity
Poet Laureate Infinity
This has never been done before in history

Nobody do it better, there ain't a truer Ripper
I did this separate imagine what we could do together
Inspired by GOD, inspired by the suffering
Was it done by a prophet? It must have been, who was it then
Rip The Jacker, hot but cold blooded
Many utter the name but very few love him
33 is the number that enlightens the Brothers
Insight to the fullest, that could brighten the dullest
The ramifications are awesome, what should we call it?
I call it my unacknowledged special access project

Thank you

A-tisket, a-tasket
A brown and yellow basket
I send a letter to my mommy
On the way I dropped it
I dropped it, I dropped it
Yes, on the way I dropped it
A little girlie picked it up
And put it in her pocket

She was truckin' on down the avenue
With not a single thing to do
She went peck, peck, pecking all around
When she spied it on the ground
She took it, she took it
My little yellow basket
And if she doesn't bring it back
I think that I will die

A-tisket, a-tasket
I lost my yellow basket
And if that girlie don't return it
Don't know what I'll do

A-tisket, a-tasket

Won't someone help me find my basket
Make me happy again?

That would never fly at the college, but taking the entire day of Halloween and playing themed music?
The idea grew, and suddenly I had pulled song after song for a playlist. It was about an eight hour loop, with about an extra hour to make sure Thriller play enough times to satisfy everyone. I did always choose the most well-known version of a song. Some times, I chose an interesting cover version.
My personal project was to hunt down as many versions as possible of the Donovan song Season of the Witch. That's the first part of my list.
Here, then, is the A to Z portion of my Halloween Playlist, sans the Donovan song:

Haven't slept a wink
I walk the floor and watch the door
And in between I drink

Black coffee
Love's a hand me down brew
I'll never know a Sunday
In this weekday room

I'm talking to the shadows
1 o'clock to 4
And Lord, how slow the moments go
When all I do is pour

Black coffee
Since the blues caught my eye
I'm hanging out on Monday
My Sunday dreams to dry

Now a man is born to go a lovin'
A woman's born to weep and fret
To stay at home and tend her oven
And drown her past regrets
In coffee and cigarettes

He played in the Negro Leagues. He was the first white man to play in the Negro Leagues. I think originally he played for the Brooklyn Dodgers, but then they traded him to the Kansas City Monarchs in exchange for Jackie Robinson or something like that, I don't know. My father was a modest man, and he didn't like to brag about his accomplishments. And they were very great accomplishments
For example, in 1965, he came to this country with just a few dollars and started the Hare Krishna religion. I still have a picture of him hanging out in Tompkins, showing the hippies how to chant and be happy. Also, my father was the first, and so far only, man to be born with Fallopian tubes. He had his nipple pierced, and his testicles, and his clitoris √¢, he was really cool. He used to work for American Standard, the toilet people, and he did some mail drops for the CIA. He always used to say to me, ""Son, Lyndon Johnson has always been made out of clothespins, but Eisenhower was a cantaloupe and only now is he Episcopalian. Nothing short of sausages and funnels for as long as you both shall live."" He never explained this to me entirely. He never had to
Speaking of testicles and clitori, about five years after he died, my father wrote a play, and the main characters were named Testiclees and Clitorus
Here is a brief excerpt:
(spoken, with Bradford as Clitorus and Sasha as Testiclees)
Clitorus: Hey Testiclees, how's it hangin'?
Testiclees: Dude
Clitorus: Dude
Testiclees: Dude, baby boomers suck. 'Cause they're old, and they don't give a fuck about AIDS research, 'cause they're all old and they don't have it, and they don't give a fuck if we all die
Clitorus: Yeah, but dude, like, at least they support free cheese enemas for the poor
Testiclees: So dude, when are you gonna introduce me to Ella Fitzgerald's underwear and Jerry van Dyke's pancreatic fluids?
Clitorus: Well, dude, when are you gonna bake me that delicious blueberry fetus pie you've been promising me?
Anyway, it went on from there. It was never produced, but Desi Arnaz bought the film rights for Paramount, and I put my share of the inheritance into mutual funds, which I parlayed into a sizable fortune, which I then spent on Q-tips and hydrogen peroxide for the Church of Hal, because I could never really get into my father's religion, dressing up in orange and jumping up and down and chanting all the time:‚Ç¨, ""Govinda jaya jaya. Gopala jaya jaya. Radharamanahari. Govinda jaya jaya."" But my father was a really great man. I'll never forget the last thing he ever said to me.

She's unable to lunch today, madam
Miss Otis regrets
She's unable to lunch today
She is sorry to be delayed
But last evening down in Lover's Lane
She strayed, madam
Miss Otis regrets
She's unable to lunch today

When she woke up and found
That her dream of love was gone, madam
She ran to the man
Who had led her so far astray
And from under her velvet gown
She drew a gun
And shot her love down, madam
Miss Otis regrets
She's unable to lunch today

When the mob came and got her
And dragged her from the jail, madam
They strung her upon the old willow across the way

It began with 35,000 shipyard workers striking for a wage increase. They appealed for support to the Seattle Central Labor Council, which recommended a city-wide strike, and in two weeks 110 locals-mostly American Federation of Labor, only a few IWW-voted to strike. The rank and file of each striking local elected three members to a General Strike Committee, and on February 6, 1939, at 10:00 A.M., the strike began.
Unity was not easy to achieve. The TWW locals were in tension with the AFL locals. Japanese locals were admitted to the General Strike Committee but were not given a vote. Still, sixty thousand union members were out, and forty thousand other workers joined in sympathy.
Seattle workers had a radical tradition. During the war, the president of the Seattle AFL, a socialist, was imprisoned for opposing the draft, was tortured, and there were great labor rallies in the streets to protest.
The city now stopped functioning, except for activities organized by the strikers to provide essential needs. Firemen agreed to stay on the job. Laundry workers handled only hospital laundry. Vehicles authorized to move carried signs ""Exempted by the General Strike Committee."" Thirty-five neighborhood milk stations were set up. Every day thirty thousand meals were prepared in large kitchens, then transported to halls all over the city and served cafeteria style, with strikers paying twenty-five cents a meal, the general public thirty-five cents. People were allowed to eat as much as they wanted of the beef stew, spaghetti, bread, and coffee.
A Labor War Veteran's Guard was organized to keep the peace. On the blackboard at one of its headquarters was written: ""The purpose of this organization is to preserve law and order without the use of force. No volunteer will have any police power or be allowed to carry weapons of any sort, but to use persuasion only."" During the strike, crime in the city decreased. The commander of the U.S. army detachment sent into the area told the strikers' committee that in forty years of military experience he hadn't seen so quiet and orderly a city. A poem printed in the Seattle Union Record (a daily newspaper put out by labor people) by someone named Anise:
What scares them most is
That NOTHING HAPPENS!
They are ready For DISTURBANCES.
They have machine guns
And soldiers,
But this SMILING SILENCE
is uncanny.
The business men
Don't understand
That sort of weapon...
It is your SMILE
That is UPSETTING
Their reliance
On Artillery, brother!
It is the garbage wagons
That go along the street
Marked ""EXEMPT
by STRIKE COMMIITED.""
It is the milk stations
That are getting better daily,
And the three hundred
WAR Veterans of Labor
Handling the crowds
WITHOUT GUNS,
For these things speak
Of a NEW POWER
And a NEW WORLD
That they do not feel
At HOME in.
The mayor swore in 2,400 special deputies, many of them students at the University of Washington. Almost a thousand sailors and marines were brought into the city by the U.S. government. The general strike ended after five days, according to the General Strike Committee because of pressure from the international officers of the various unions, as well as the difficulties of living in a shut-down city.
The strike had been peaceful. But when it was over, there were raids and arrests: on the Socialist party headquarters, on a printing plant. Thirty-nine members of the IWW were jailed as ""ring- leaders of anarchy.""
In Centralia, Washington, where the IWW had been organizing lumber workers, the lumber interests made plans to get rid of the IWW. On November 11, 1919, Armistice Day, the Legion paraded through town with rubber hoses and gas pipes, and the IWW prepared for an attack. When the Legion passed the IWW hall, shots were fired-it is unclear who fired first. They stormed the hall, there was more firing, and three Legion men were killed.
Inside the headquarters was an IWW member, a lumberjack named Frank Everett, who had been in France as a soldier while the IWW national leaders were on trial for obstructing the war effort. Everett was in army uniform and carrying a rifle. He emptied it into the crowd, dropped it, and ran for the woods, followed by a mob. He started to wade across the river, found the current too strong, turned, shot the leading man dead, threw his gun into the river, and fought the mob with his fists. They dragged him back to town behind an automobile, suspended him from a telegraph pole, took him down, locked him in jail. That night, his jailhouse door was broken down, he was dragged out, put on the floor of a car, his genitals were cut off, and then he was taken to a bridge, hanged, and his body riddled with bullets.
No one was ever arrested for Everett's murder, but eleven Wobblies were put on trial for killing an American Legion leader during the parade, and six of them spent fifteen years in prison.
Why such a reaction to the general strike, to the organizing of the Wobblies? A statement by the mayor of Seattle suggests that the Establishment feared not just the strike itself but what it symbolized. He said:
The so-called sympathetic Seattle strike was an attempted revolution. That there was no violence does not alter the fact. .. . The intent, openly and covertly announced, was for the overthrow of the industrial system; here first, then everywhere. .. . True, there were no flashing guns, no bombs, no killings. Revolution, I repeat, doesn't need violence. The general strike, as practiced in Seattle, is of itself the weapon of revolution, all the more dangerous because quiet. To succeed, it must suspend everything; stop the entire life stream of a community. . .. That is to say, it puts the government out of operation. And that is all there is to revolt-no matter how achieved.
Furthermore, the Seattle general strike took place in the midst of a wave of postwar rebellions all over the world. A writer in The Nation commented that year:
The most extraordinary phenomenon of the present time ... is the unprecedented revolt of the rank and file...
In Russia it has dethroned the Czar.... In Korea and India and Egypt and Ireland it keeps up an unyielding resistance to political tyranny. In England it brought about the railway strike, against the judgement of the men's own executives. In Seattle and San Francisco it has resulted in the stevedores' recent refusal to handle arms or supplies destined for the overthrow of the Soviet Government. In one district of Illinois it manifested itself in a resolution of striking miners, unanimously requesting their state executive ""to go to Hell"". In Pittsburgh, according to Mr. Gompers, it compelled the reluctant American Federation officers to call the steel strike, lest the control pass into the hands of the I.W.W.'s and other ""radicals"". In New York, it brought about the longshoremen's strike and kept the men out in defiance of union officials, and caused the upheaval in the printing trade, which the international officers, even though the employers worked hand in glove with them, were completely unable to control.
The common man .. . losing faith in the old leadership, has experienced a new access of self- confidence, or at least a new recklessness, a readiness to take chances on his own account . .. authority cannot any longer be imposed from above; it comes automatically from below.
In the steel mills of western Pennsylvania later in 1919, where men worked twelve hours a day, six days a week, doing exhausting work under intense heat, 100,000 steelworkers were signed up in twenty different AFL craft unions. A National Committee attempting to tie them together in their organizing drive found in the summer of 1919 ""the men are letting it be known that if we do not do something for them they will take the matter into their own hands.""
The National Council was getting telegrams like the one from the Johnstown Steel Workers Council: ""Unless the National Committee authorizes a national strike vote to be taken this week we will be compelled to go on strike here alone."" William Z. Foster (later a Communist leader, at this time secretary-treasurer to the National Committee in charge of organizing) received a telegram from organizers in the Youngstown district: ""We cannot he expected to meet the enraged workers, who will consider us traitors if strike is postponed.""
There was pressure from President Woodrow Wilson and Samuel Gompers, AFL president, to postpone the strike. But the steelworkers were too insistent, and in September 1919, not only the 100,000 union men but 250,000 others went out on strike.
The sheriff of Allegheny County swore in as deputies five thousand employees of U.S. Steel who had not gone on strike, and announced that outdoor meetings would be forbidden. A report of the Interchurch World Movement made at the time said:
In Monessen .. . the policy of the State Police was simply to club men off the streets and drive them into their homes.... In Braddock .. . when a striker was clubbed in the street he would be taken to jail, kept there over night . . . Many of those arrested in Newcastle .. . were ordered not to be released until the strike was over.
The Department of Justice moved in, carrying out raids on workers who were aliens, holding them for deportation. At Gary, Indiana, federal troops were sent in.
Other factors operated against the strikers. Most were recent immigrants, of many nationalities, many languages. Sherman Service, Inc., hired by the steel corporations to break the strike, instructed its men in South Chicago: ""We want you to stir up as much bad feeling as you possibly can between the Serbians and the Italians. Spread data among the Serbians that the Italians are going back to work.... Urge them to go back to work or the Italians will get their jobs."" More than thirty thousand black workers were brought into the area as strikebreakers-they had been excluded from AFL unions and so felt no loyalty to unionism.
As the strike dragged on, the mood of defeat spread, and workers began to drift hack to work. After ten weeks, the number of strikers was down to 110,000, and then the National Committee called the strike off.
In the year following the war, 120,000 textile workers struck in New England and New Jersey, and 30,000 silk workers struck in Paterson, New Jersey. In Boston the police went out on strike, and in New York City cigarmakers, shirtmakers, carpenters, bakers, teamsters, and barbers were out on strike. In Chicago, the press reported, ""More strikes and lockouts accompany the mid-summer heat than ever known before at any one time."" Five thousand workers at International Harvester and five thousand city workers were in the streets.
When the twenties began, however, the situation seemed under control. The IWW was destroyed, the Socialist party falling apart. The strikes were beaten down by force, and the economy was doing just well enough for just enough people to prevent mass rebellion.
Congress, in the twenties, put an end to the dangerous, turbulent flood of immigrants (14 million between 1900 and 1920) by passing laws setting immigration quotas: the quotas favored Anglo- Saxons, kept out black and yellow people, limited severely the coming of Latins, Slavs, Jews. No African country could send more than 100 people; 100 was the limit for China, for Bulgaria, for Palestine; 34,007 could come from England or Northern Ireland, but only 3,845 from Italy; 51,227 from Germany, but only 124 from Lithuania; 28,567 from the Irish Free State, but only 2,248 from Russia.
The Ku Klux Klan was revived in the 1920s, and it spread into the North. By 1924 it had 4M million members. The NAACP seemed helpless in the face of mob violence and race hatred everywhere. The impossibility of the black persons ever being considered equal in white America was the theme of the nationalist movement led in the 1920s by Marcus Garvey. He preached black pride, racial separation, and a return to Africa, which to him held the only hope for black unity and survival. But Garvey's movement, inspiring as it was to some blacks, could not make much headway against the powerful white supremacy currents of the postwar decade.
There was some truth to the standard picture of the twenties as a time of prosperity and fun-the Jazz Age, the Roaring Twenties. Unemployment was down, from 4,270,000 in 1921 to a little over 2 million in 1927. The general level of wages for workers rose. Some farmers made a lot of money. The 40 percent of all families who made over $2,000 a year could buy new gadgets: autos, radios, refrigerators. Millions of people were not doing badly-and they could be shut out of the picture the others-the tenant farmers, black and white, the immigrant families in the big cities either without work or not making enough to get the basic necessities.
But prosperity was concentrated at the top. While from 1922 to 1929 real wages in manufacturing went up per capita 1.4 percent a year, the holders of common stocks gained 16.4 percent a year. Six million families (42 percent of the total) made less than $1,000 a year. One-tenth of 1 percent of the families at the top received as much income as 42 percent of the families at the bottom, according to a report of the Brookings Institution. Every year in the 1920s, about 25,000 workers were killed on the job and 100,000 permanently disabled. Two million people in New York City lived in tenements condemned as rattraps.
The country was full of little industrial towns like Muncie, Indiana, where, according to Robert and Helen Lynd (Middletown), the class system was revealed by the time people got up in the morning: for two-thirds of the city's families, ""the father gets up in the dark in winter, eats hastily in the kitchen in the gray dawn, and is at work from an hour to two and a quarter hours before his children have to be at school.""
There were enough well-off people to push the others into the background. And with the rich controlling the means of dispensing information, who would tell? Historian Merle Curti observed about the twenties:
It was, in fact, only the upper ten percent of the population that enjoyed a marked increase in real income. But the protests which such facts normally have evoked could not make themselves widely or effectively felt. This was in part the result of the grand strategy of the major political parties. In part it was the result of the fact that almost all the chief avenues to mass opinion were now controlled by large-scale publishing industries.
Some writers tried to break through: Theodore Dreiser, Sinclair Lewis, Lewis Mumford. F. Scott Fitzgerald, in an article, ""Echoes of the Jazz Age,"" said: ""It was borrowed time anyway-the whole upper tenth of a nation living with the insouciance of a grand due and the casualness of chorus girls."" He saw ominous signs amid that prosperity: drunkenness, unhappiness, violence:
A classmate killed his wife and himself on Long Island, another tumbled ""accidentally"" from a skyscraper in Philadelphia, another purposely from a skyscraper in New York. One was killed in a speak-easy in Chicago; another was beaten to death in a speak-easy in New York and crawled home to the Princeton Club to die; still another had his skull crushed by a maniac's axe in an insane asylum where he was confined.
Sinclair Lewis captured the false sense of prosperity, the shallow pleasure of the new gadgets for the middle classes, in his novel Babbitt:
It was the best of nationally advertised and quantitatively produced alarm-clocks, with all modern attachments, including cathedral chime, intermittent alarm, and a phosphorescent dial. Babbitt was proud of being awakened by such a rich device. Socially it was almost as creditable as buying expensive cord tires.
He sulkily admitted now that there was no more escape, but he lay and detested the grind of the real-estate business, and disliked his family, and disliked himself for disliking them.
Women had finally, after long agitation, won the right to vote in 1920 with the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment, but voting was still a middle-class and upper-class activity. Eleanor Flexner, recounting the history of the movement, says the effect of female suffrage was that ""women have shown the same tendency to divide along orthodox party lines as male voters.""
Few political figures spoke out for the poor of the twenties. One was Fiorello La Guardia, a Congressman from a district of poor immigrants in East Harlem (who ran, oddly, on both Socialist and Republican tickets). In the mid-twenties he was made aware by people in his district of the high price of meat. When La Guardia asked Secretary of Agriculture William Jardine to investigate the high price of meat, the Secretary sent him a pamphlet on how to use meat economically. La Guardia wrote back:
I asked for help and you send me a bulletin. The people of New York City cannot feed their children on Department bulletins.. .. Your bulletins . .. are of no use to the tenement dwellers of this great city. The housewives of New York have been trained by hard experience on the economical use of meat. What we want is the help of your department on the meat profiteers who are keeping the hard-working people of this city from obtaining proper nourishment.
During the presidencies of Harding and Coolidge in the twenties, the Secretary of the Treasury was Andrew Mellon, one of the richest men in America. In 1923, Congress was presented with the ""Mellon Plan,"" calling for what looked like a general reduction of income taxes, except that the top income brackets would have their tax rates lowered from 50 percent to 25 percent, while the lowest-income group would have theirs lowered from 4 percent to 3 percent. A few Congressmen from working-class districts spoke against the bill, like William P. Connery of Massachusetts:
I am not going to have my people who work in the shoe factories of Lynn and in the mills in Lawrence and the leather industry of Peabody, in these days of so-called Republican prosperity when they are working but three days in the week think that I am in accord with the provisions of this bill. . .. When I see a provision in this Mellon tax bill which is going to save Mr. Mellon himself $800,000 on his income tax and his brother $600,000 on his, I cannot give it my support.
The Mellon Plan passed. In 1928, La Guardia toured the poorer districts of New York and said: ""I confess I was not prepared for what I actually saw. It seemed almost incredible that such conditions of poverty could really exist.""
Buried in the general news of prosperity in the twenties were, from time to time, stories of bitter labor struggles. In 1922, coal miners and railroad men went on strike, and Senator Burton Wheeler of Montana, a Progressive elected with labor votes, visited the strike area and reported:
All day long I have listened to heartrending stories of women evicted from their homes by the coal companies. I heard pitiful pleas of little children crying for bread. I stood aghast as I heard most amazing stories from men brutally beaten by private policemen. It has been a shocking and nerve- racking experience.
A textile strike in Rhode Island in 1922 among Italian and Portuguese workers failed, but class feelings were awakened and some of the strikers joined radical movements. Luigi Nardella recalled:
... my oldest brother, Guido, he started the strike. Guido pulled the handles on the looms in the Royal Mills, going from one section to the next shouting, ""Strike! Strike!"" . . . When the strike started we didn't have any union organizers... .. We got together a group of girls and went from mill to mill, and that morning we got five mills out. We'd motion to the girls in the mills, ""Come out! Come out!"" Then we'd go on to the next. . . .
Somebody from the Young Workers' League came out to bring a check, and invited me to a meeting, and I went. Then I joined, and in a few years I was in the Risorgimento Club in Providence. We were anti-Fascists. I spoke on street corners, bring a stand, jump up and talk to good crowds. And we led the support for Sacco and Vanzetti.. . .
After the war, with the Socialist party weakened, a Communist party was organized, and Communists were involved in the organization of the Trade Union Education League, which tried to build a militant spirit inside the AFL. When a Communist named Ben Gold, of the furriers' section of the TUEL, challenged the AFL union leadership at a meeting, he was knifed and beaten. In 1926, he and other Communists organized a strike of furriers who formed mass picket lines, battled the police to hold their lines, were arrested and beaten, but kept striking, until they won a forty-hour week and a wage increase.
Communists again played a leading part in the great textile strike that spread through the Carolinas and Tennessee in the spring of 1929. The mill owners had moved to the South to escape unions, to find more subservient workers among the poor whites. But these workers rebelled against the long hours, the low pay. They particularly resented the ""stretch-out""-an intensification of work. For instance, -a weaver who had operated twenty-four looms and got $18.91 a week would be raised to $23, but he would be ""stretched out"" to a hundred looms and had to work at a punishing pace.
The first of the textile strikes was in Tennessee, where five hundred women in one mill walked out in protest against wages of $9 to $10 a week. Then at Gastonia, North Carolina, workers joined a new union, the National Textile Workers Union, led by Communists, which admitted both blacks and whites to membership. When some of them were fired, half of the two thousand workers went out on strike. An atmosphere of anti-Communism and racism built up and violence began. Textile strikes began to spread across South Carolina.
One by one the various strikes were settled, with some gains, but not at Gastonia. There, with the textile workers living in a tent colony, and refusing to renounce the Communists in their leadership, the strike went on. But strikebreakers were brought in and the mills kept operating. Desperation grew; there were violent clashes with the police. One dark night, the chief of police was killed in a gun battle and sixteen strikers and sympathizers were indicted for murder, including Fred Real, a Communist party organizer. Ultimately seven were tried and given sentences of from five to twenty years. They were released on bail, and left the state; the Communists escaped to Soviet Russia. Through all the defeats, the beatings, the murders, however, it was the beginning of textile mill unionism in the South.
The stock market crash of 1929, which marked the beginning of the Great Depression of the United States, came directly from wild speculation which collapsed and brought the whole economy down with it. But, as John Galbraith says in his study of that event (The Great Crash), behind that speculation was the fact that ""the economy was fundamentally unsound."" He points to very unhealthy corporate and banking structures, an unsound foreign trade, much economic misinformation, and the ""bad distribution of income"" (the highest 5 percent of the population received about one-third of all personal income).
A socialist critic would go further and say that the capitalist system was by its nature unsound: a system driven by the one overriding motive of corporate profit and therefore unstable, unpredictable, and blind to human needs. The result of all that: permanent depression for many of its people, and periodic crises for almost everybody. Capitalism, despite its attempts at self-reform, its organization for better control, was still in 1929 a sick and undependable system.
After the crash, the economy was stunned, barely moving. Over five thousand banks closed and huge numbers of businesses, unable to get money, closed too. Those that continued laid off employees and cut the wages of those who remained, again and again. Industrial production fell by 50 percent, and by 1933 perhaps 15 million (no one knew exactly)- one-fourth or one-third of the labor force-were out of work. The Ford Motor Company, which in the spring of 1929 had employed 128,000 workers, was down to 37,000 by August of 1931. By the end of 1930, almost half the 280,000 textile mill workers in New England were out of work. Former President Calvin Coolidge commented with his customary wisdom: ""When more and more people are thrown out of work, unemployment results."" He spoke again in early 1931, ""This country is not in good condition.""
Clearly those responsible for organizing the economy did not know what had happened, were baffled by it, refused to recognize it, and found reasons other than the failure of the system. Herbert Hoover had said, not long before the crash: ""We in America today are nearer to the final triumph over poverty than ever before in the history of any land."" Henry Ford, in March 1931, said the crisis was here because ""the average man won't really do a day's work unless he is caught and cannot get out of it. There is plenty of work to do if people would do it."" A few weeks later he laid off 75,000 workers.
There were millions of tons of food around, but it was not profitable to transport it, to sell it. Warehouses were full of clothing, but people could not afford it. There were lots of houses, but they stayed empty because people couldn't pay the rent, had been evicted, and now lived in shacks in quickly formed ""Hoovervilles"" built on garbage dumps.
Brief glimpses of reality in the newspapers could have been multiplied by the millions: A New York Times story in early 1932:
After vainly trying to get a stay of dispossession until January 15 from his apartment at 46 Hancock Street in Brooklyn, yesterday, Peter J. Cornell, 48 years old, a former roofing contractor out of work and penniless, fell dead in the arms of his wife.
A doctor gave the cause of his death as heart disease, and the police said it had at least partly been caused by the bitter disappointment of a long day's fruitless attempt to prevent himself and his family being put out on the street... .
Cornell owed $5 in rent in arrears and $39 for January which his landlord required in advance. Failure to produce the money resulted in a dispossess order being served on the family yesterday and to take effect at the end of the week.
After vainly seeking assistance elsewhere, he was told during the day by the Home Relief Bureau that it would have no funds with which to help him until January 15.
A dispatch from Wisconsin to The Nation, in late 1932:
Throughout the middle west the tension between the farmers and authorities has been growing ... as a result of tax and foreclosure sales. In many cases evictions have been prevented only by mass action on the part of the farmers. However, until the Cichon homestead near Elkhorn, Wisconsin, was besieged on December 6 by a host of deputy sheriffs armed with machine-guns, rifles, shotguns, and tear-gas bombs, there had been no actual violence. Max Cichon's property was auctioned off at a foreclosure sale last August, but he refused to allow either the buyer or the authorities to approach his home. He held off unwelcome visitors with a shotgun. The sheriff called upon Cichon to submit peacefully. When he refused to do so, the sheriff ordered deputies to lay down a barrage of machine-gun and rifle fire . . . Cichon is now in jail in Elkhorn, and his wife and two children, who were with him in the house, are being cared for in the county hospital. Cichon is not a trouble-maker. He enjoys the confidence of his neighbors, who only recently elected him justice of the peace of the town of Sugar Creek. That a man of his standing and disposition should go to such lengths in defying the authorities is a clear warning that we may expect further trouble in the agricultural districts unless the farmers are soon helped.
A tenement dweller on 113th Street in East Harlem wrote to Congressman Fiorello La Guardia in Washington:
You know my condition is bad. I used to get pension from the government and they stopped. It is now nearly seven months I am out of work. I hope you will try to do something for me.. .. I have four children who are in need of clothes and food.. .. My daughter who is eight is very ill and not recovering. My rent is due two months and I am afraid of being put out.
In Oklahoma, the farmers found their farms sold under the auctioneer's hammer, their farms turning to dust, the tractors coming in and taking over. John Steinbeck, in his novel of the depression, The Grapes of Wrath, describes what happened:
And the dispossessed, the migrants, flowed into California, two hundred and fifty thousand, and three hundred thousand. Behind them new tractors were going on the land and the tenants were being forced off. And new waves were on the way, new waves of the dispossessed and the homeless, hard, intent, and dangerous. . ..
And a homeless hungry man, driving the road with his wife beside him and his thin children in the back seat, could look at the fallow fields which might produce food but not profit, and that man could know how a fallow field is a sin and the unused land a crime against the thin children.. . .
And in the south he saw the golden oranges hanging on the trees, the little golden oranges on the dark green trees; and guards with shotguns patrolling the lines so a man might not pick an orange for a thin child, oranges to be dumped if the price was low. . , .
These people were becoming ""dangerous,"" as Steinbeck said. The spirit of rebellion was growing. Mauritz Hallgren, in a 1933 book, Seeds of Revolt, compiled newspaper reports of things happening around the country:
England, Arkansas, January 3, 1931. The long drought that ruined hundreds of Arkansas farms last summer had a dramatic sequel late today when some 500 farmers, most of them white men and many of them armed, marched on the business section of this town. .. . Shouting that they must have food for themselves and their families, the invaders announced their intention to take it from the stores unless it were provided from some other source without cost.
Detroit, July 9, 1931. An incipient riot by 500 unemployed men turned out of the city lodging house for lack of funds was quelled by police reserves in Cadillac Square tonight. . ..
Indiana Harbor, Indiana, August 5, 1931. Fifteen hundred jobless men stormed the plant of the Fruit Growers Express Company here, demanding that they be given jobs to keep from starving. The company's answer was to call the city police, who routed the jobless with menacing clubs.
Boston, November 10, 1931. Twenty persons were treated for injuries, three were hurt so seriously that they may die, and dozens of others were nursing wounds from flying bottles, lead pipe, and stones after clashes between striking longshoremen and Negro strikebreakers along the Charlestown-East Boston waterfront.
Detroit, November 28, 1931. A mounted patrolman was hit on the head with a stone and unhorsed and one demonstrator was arrested during a disturbance in Grand Circus Park this morning when 2000 men and women met there in defiance of police orders.
Chicago, April 1, 1932. Five hundred school children, most with haggard faces and in tattered clothes, paraded through Chicago's downtown section to the Board of Education offices to demand that the school system provide them with food.
Boston, June 3, 1932. Twenty-five hungry children raided a buffet lunch set up for Spanish War veterans during a Boston parade. Two automobile-loads of police were called to drive them away.
New York, January 21, 1933. Several hundred jobless surrounded a restaurant just off Union Square today demanding they be fed without charge.. . .
Seattle, February 16, 1933. A two-day siege of the County-City Building, occupied by an army of about 5,000 unemployed, was ended early tonight, deputy sheriffs and police evicting the demonstrators after nearly two hours of efforts.
Yip Harburg, the songwriter, told Studs Terkel about the year 1932: ""I was walking along the street at that time, and you'd see the bread lines. The biggest one in New York City was owned by William Randolph Hearst. He had a big truck with several people on it, and big cauldrons of hot soup, bread. Fellows with burlap on their feet were lined up all around Columbus Circle, and went for blocks and blocks around the park, waiting.""

That makes the lonely winter seem long
You are the breathless hush of evening
That trembles on the brink of a lovely song

Someday my happy arms will hold you
And someday I'll know that moment divine

A Memoir of a Childhood
By Frank McCourt
This book is dedicated to my brothers, Malachy, Michael, Alphonsus. I learn from you, I admire you and I love you.
Acknowledgments
This is a small hymn to an exaltation of women.
R'lene Dahlberg fanned the embers.
Lisa Schwarzbaum read early pages and encouraged me.
Mary Breasted Smyth, elegant novelist herself, read the first third
and passed it on to Molly Friedrich, who became my agent and thought that Nan Graham, Editor-in-Chief at Scribner, would be just the right person to put the book on the road.
And Molly was right.
My daughter, Maggie, has shown me how life can be a grand adventure, while exquisite moments with my granddaughter, Chiara, have helped me recall a small child's wonder.
My wife, Ellen, listened while I read and cheered me to the final
page.
I am blessed among men.

I
My father and mother should have stayed in New York where they met and married and where I was born. Instead, they returned to Ireland when I was four, my brother, Malachy, three, the twins, Oliver and Eugene, barely one, and my sister, Margaret, dead and gone.
When I look back on my childhood I wonder how I survived at all. It was, of course, a miserable childhood: the happy childhood is hardly worth your while. Worse than the ordinary miserable childhood is the miserable Irish childhood, and worse yet is the miserable Irish Catholic childhood.
People everywhere brag and whimper about the woes of their early years, but nothing can compare with the Irish version: the poverty; the shiftless loquacious alcoholic father; the pious defeated mother moaning by the fire; pompous priests; bullying schoolmasters; the English and the terrible things they did to us for eight hundred long years.
Above all-we were wet.
Out in the Atlantic Ocean great sheets of rain gathered to drift slowly up the River Shannon and settle forever in Limerick. The rain dampened the city from the Feast of the Circumcision to New Year's Eve.
It created a cacophony of hacking coughs, bronchial rattles, asthmatic wheezes, consumptive croaks. It turned noses into fountains, lungs into bacterial sponges. It provoked cures galore; to ease the catarrh you boiled onions in milk blackened with pepper; for the congested passages you made a paste of boiled flour and nettles, wrapped it in a rag, and slapped it, sizzling, on the chest.
From October to April the walls of Limerick glistened with the damp. Clothes never dried: tweed and woolen coats housed living things, sometimes sprouted mysterious vegetations. In pubs, steam rose from damp bodies and garments to be inhaled with cigarette and pipe smoke laced with the stale fumes of spilled stout and whiskey and tinged with the odor of piss wafting in from the outdoor jakes where many a man puked up his week's wages.
The rain drove us into the church-our refuge, our strength, our only dry place. At Mass, Benediction, novenas, we huddled in great damp clumps, dozing through priest drone, while steam rose again from our clothes to mingle with the sweetness of incense, flowers and candles.
Limerick gained a reputation for piety, but we knew it was only the
rain.
My father, Malachy McCourt, was born on a farm in Toome, County
Antrim. Like his father before, he grew up wild, in trouble with the English, or the Irish, or both. He fought with the Old IRA and for some desperate act he wound up a fugitive with a price on his head.
When I was a child I would look at my father, the thinning hair, the collapsing teeth, and wonder why anyone would give money for a head like that. When I was thirteen my father's mother told me a secret: as a wee lad your poor father was dropped on his head. It was an accident, he was never the same after, and you must remember that people dropped on their heads can be a bit peculiar.
Because of the price on the head he had been dropped on, he had to be spirited out of Ireland via cargo ship from Galway. In New York, with Prohibition in full swing, he thought he had died and gone to hell for his sins. Then he discovered speakeasies and he rejoiced.
After wandering and drinking in America and England he yearned for peace in his declining years. He returned to Belfast, which erupted all around him. He said, A pox on all their houses, and chatted with the ladies of Andersontown. They tempted him with delicacies but he waved them away and drank his tea. He no longer smoked or touched alcohol, so what was the use? It was time to go and he died in the Royal Victoria Hospital.
My mother, the former Angela Sheehan, grew up in a Limerick slum with her mother, two brothers, Thomas and Patrick, and a sister, Agnes. She never saw her father, who had run off to Australia weeks before her birth.
After a night of drinking porter in the pubs of Limerick he staggers down the lane singing his favorite song, Who threw the overalls in Mrs. Murphy's chowder?
Nobody spoke so he said it all the louder It's a dirty Irish trick and I can lick the Mick Who threw the overalls in Murphy's chowder.
He's in great form altogether and he thinks he'll play a while with little Patrick, one year old. Lovely little fella. Loves his daddy. Laughs when Daddy throws him up in the air. Upsy daisy, little Paddy, upsy daisy, up in the air in the dark, so dark, oh, Jasus, you miss the child on the way down and poor little Patrick lands on his head, gurgles
a bit, whimpers, goes quiet. Grandma heaves herself from the bed, heavy with the child in her belly, my mother. She's barely able to lift little Patrick from the floor. She moans a long moan over the child and turns on Grandpa. Get out of it. Out. If you stay here a minute longer I'll take the hatchet to you, you drunken lunatic. By Jesus, I'll swing at the end of a rope for you. Get out.
Grandpa stands his ground like a man. I have a right, he says, to stay in me own house.
She runs at him and he melts before this whirling dervish with a damaged child in her arms and a healthy one stirring inside. He stumbles from the house, up the lane, and doesn't stop till he reaches Melbourne in Australia.
Little Pat, my uncle, was never the same after. He grew up soft in the head with a left leg that went one way, his body the other. He never learned to read or write but God blessed him in another way. When he started to sell newspapers at the age of eight he could count money better than the Chancellor of the Exchequer himself. No one knew why he was called Ab Sheehan, The Abbot, but all Limerick loved him.
My mother's troubles began the night she was born. There is my grandmother in the bed heaving and gasping with the labor pains, praying to St. Gerard Majella, patron saint of expectant mothers. There is Nurse O'Halloran, the midwife, all dressed up in her finery. It's New Year's Eve and Mrs. O'Halloran is anxious for this child to be born so that she can rush off to the parties and celebrations. She tells my grandmother: Will you push, will you, push. Jesus, Mary and holy St. Joseph, if you don't hurry with this child it won't be born till the New Year and what good is that to me with me new dress? Never mind St. Gerard Majella. What can a man do for a woman at a time like this even if he is a saint? St. Gerard Majella my arse.
My grandmother switches her prayers to St. Ann, patron saint of difficult labor. But the child won't come. Nurse O'Halloran tells my grandmother, Pray to St. Jude, patron saint of desperate cases.
St. Jude, patron of desperate cases, help me. I'm desperate. She grunts and pushes and the infant's head appears, only the head, my mother, and it's the stroke of midnight, the New Year. Limerick City erupts with whistles, horns, sirens, brass bands, people calling and singing, Happy New Year. Should auld acquaintance be forgot, and church bells all over ring out the Angelus and Nurse O'Halloran weeps for the waste of a dress, that child still in there and me in me finery. Will you come out, child, will you? Grandma gives a great push and the child is in the world, a lovely girl with black curly hair and sad blue eyes.
Ah, Lord above, says Nurse O'Halloran, this child is a time straddler, born with her head in the New Year and her arse in the Old or was it her head in the Old Year and her arse in the New. You'll have to write to the Pope, missus, to find out what year this child was born in and I'll save this dress for next year.
And the child was named Angela for the Angelus which rang the midnight hour, the New Year, the minute of her coming and because she was a little angel anyway.
Love her as in childhood
Though feeble, old and grey.
For you'll never miss a mother's love
Till she's buried beneath the clay.
At the St. Vincent de Paul School, Angela learned to read, write, and calculate and by her ninth year her schooling was done. She tried her hand at being a charwoman, a skivvy, a maid with a little white hat opening doors, but she could not manage the little curtsy that is required and her mother said, You don't have the knack of it. You're pure useless. Why don't you go to America where there's room for all sorts of uselessness? I'll give you the fare.
She arrived in New York just in time for the first Thanksgiving Day of the Great Depression. She met Malachy at a party given by Dan MacAdorey and his wife, Minnie, on Classon Avenue in Brooklyn. Malachy liked Angela and she liked him. He had a hangdog look, which came from the three months he had just spent in jail for hijacking a truck. He and his friend John McErlaine believed what they were told in the speakeasy, that the truck was packed to the roof with cases of canned pork and beans. Neither knew how to drive and when the police saw the truck lurch and jerk along Myrtle Avenue they pulled it over. The police searched the truck and wondered why anyone would hijack a truck containing, not pork and beans, but cases of buttons.
With Angela drawn to the hangdog look and Malachy lonely after three months in jail, there was bound to be a knee-trembler.
A knee-trembler is the act itself done up against a wall, man and woman up on their toes, straining so hard their knees tremble with the excitement that's in it.
That knee-trembler put Angela in an interesting condition and, of course, there was talk. Angela had cousins, the MacNamara sisters, Delia and Philomena, married, respectively, to Jimmy Fortune of County Mayo, and Tommy Flynn, of Brooklyn itself.
Delia and Philomena were large women, great-breasted and fierce. When they sailed along the sidewalks of Brooklyn lesser creatures stepped aside, respect was shown. The sisters knew what was right and they knew what was wrong and any doubts could be resolved by the One, Holy, Roman, Catholic and Apostolic Church. They knew that Angela, unmarried, had no right to be in an interesting condition and they would take steps.
Steps they took. With Jimmy and Tommy in tow they marched to the speakeasy on Atlantic Avenue where Malachy could be found on Friday, payday when he had a job. The man in the speak, Joey Cacciamani, did not want to admit the sisters but Philomena told him that if he wanted to keep the nose on his face and that door on its hinges he'd better open up for they were there on God's business. Joey said, Awright, awright, you Irish. Jeezoz! Trouble, trouble.
Malachy, at the far end of the bar, turned pale, gave the great breasted ones a sickly smile, offered them a drink. They resisted the smile and spurned the offer. Delia said, We don't know what class of a tribe you come from in the North of Ireland.
Philomena said, There is a suspicion you might have Presbyterians in your family, which would explain what you did to our cousin.
Jimmy said, Ah, now, ah, now. 'Tisn't his fault if there's Presbyterians in his family.
Delia said, You shuddup.
Tommy had to join in. What you did to that poor unfortunate girl is a disgrace to the Irish race and you should be ashamed of yourself.
Och, I am, said Malachy. I am.
Nobody asked you to talk, said Philomena. You done enough damage with your blather, so shut your yap.
And while your yap is shut, said Delia, we're here to see you do the right thing by our poor cousin, Angela Sheehan.
Malachy said, Och, indeed, indeed. The right thing is the right thing and I'd be glad to buy you all a drink while we have this little
talk.
Take the drink, said Tommy, and shove it up your ass.
Philomena said, Our little cousin no sooner gets off the boat than
you are at her. We have morals in Limerick, you know, morals. We're not like jackrabbits from Antrim, a place crawling with Presbyterians.
Jimmy said, He don't look like a Presbyterian.
You shuddup, said Delia.
Another thing we noticed, said Philomena. You have a very odd
manner.
Malachy smiled. I do?
about
You do, says Delia. I think 'tis one of the first things we noticed you, that odd manner, and it gives us a very uneasy feeling.
'Tis that sneaky little Presbyterian smile, said Philomena.
Och, said Malachy, it's just the trouble I have with my teeth. Teeth or no teeth, odd manner or no odd manner, you're gonna marry
that girl, said Tommy. Up the middle aisle you're going.
Och, said Malachy, I wasn't planning to get married, you know.
There's no work and I wouldn't be able to support... Married is what you're going to be, said Delia. Up the middle aisle, said Jimmy.
You shuddup, said Delia.
Malachy watched them leave. I'm in a desperate pickle, he told Joey Cacciamani.
Bet your ass, said Joey. I see them babes comin' at me I jump inna Hudson River.
Malachy considered the pickle he was in. He had a few dollars in his pocket from the last job and he had an uncle in San Francisco or one of the other California Sans. Wouldn't he be better off in California, far from the great breasted MacNamara sisters and their grim husbands? He would, indeed, and he'd have a drop of the Irish to celebrate his decision and departure. Joey poured and the drink nearly took the lining off Malachy's gullet. Irish, indeed! He told Joey it was a Prohibition concoction from the devil's own still. Joey shrugged. I don't know nothing. I only pour. Still, it was better than nothing and Malachy would have another and one for yourself, Joey, and ask them two decent Italians what they'd like and what are you talking about, of course, I have the money to pay for it.
He awoke on a bench in the Long Island Railroad Station, a cop rapping on his boots with a nightstick, his escape money gone, the MacNamara sisters ready to eat him alive in Brooklyn.
On the feast of St. Joseph, a bitter day in March, four months after the knee-trembler, Malachy married Angela and in August the child was born. In November Malachy got drunk and decided it was time to register the child's birth. He thought he might name the child Malachy, after himself, but his North of Ireland accent and the alcoholic mumble confused the clerk so much he simply entered the name Male on the certificate.
Not until late December did they take Male to St. Paul's Church to be baptized and named Francis after his father's father and the lovely saint of Assisi. Angela wanted to give him a middle name, Munchin, after the patron saint of Limerick but Malachy said over his dead body. No son of his would have a Limerick name. It's hard enough going through life with one name. Sticking on middle names was an atrocious American habit and there was no need for a second name when you're christened after the man from Assisi.
There was a delay the day of the baptism when the chosen godfather, John McErlaine, got drunk at the speakeasy and forgot his responsibilities. Philomena told her husband, Tommy, he'd have to be godfather. Child's soul is in danger, she said. Tommy put his head down and grumbled. All right. I'll be godfather but I'm not goin' to be responsible if he grows up like his father causin' trouble and goin' through life with the odd manner for if he does he can go to John McErlaine at the speakeasy. The priest said, True for you, Tom, decent man that you are, fine man that never set foot inside a speakeasy. Malachy, fresh from the speakeasy himself, felt insulted and wanted to argue with the priest, one sacrilege on top of another. Take off that collar and we'll see who's the man. He had to be held back by the great breasted ones and their husbands grim. Angela, new mother, agitated, forgot she was holding the child and let him slip into the baptismal font, a total immersion of the Protestant type. The altar boy assisting the priest plucked the infant from the font and restored him to Angela, who sobbed and clutched him, dripping, to her bosom. The priest laughed, said he had never seen the likes, that the child was a regular little Baptist now and hardly needed a priest. This maddened Malachy again and he wanted to jump at the priest for calling the child some class of a Protestant. The priest said, Quiet, man, you're in God's house, and when Malachy said, God's house, my arse, he was thrown out on Court Street because you can't say arse in God's house.
After baptism Philomena said she had tea and ham and cakes in her house around the corner. Malachy said, Tea? and she said, Yes, tea, or is it whiskey you want? He said tea was grand but first he'd have to go and deal with John McErlaine, who didn't have the decency to carry out his duties as godfather. Angela said, You're only looking for an excuse to run to the speakeasy, and he said, As God is my witness, the drink is the last thing on my mind. Angela started to cry. Your son's christening day and you have to go drinking. Delia told him he was a disgusting specimen but what could you expect from the North of Ireland.
Malachy looked from one to the other, shifted on his feet, pulled his cap down over his eyes, shoved his hands deep in his trouser pockets, said, Och, aye, the way they do in the far reaches of County Antrim, turned, hurried up Court Street to the speakeasy on Atlantic Avenue where he was sure they'd ply him with free drink in honor of his son's baptism.
At Philomena's house the sisters and their husbands ate and drank while Angela sat in a corner nursing the baby and crying. Philomena stuffed her mouth with bread and ham and rumbled at Angela, That's what you get for being such a fool. Hardly off the boat and you fall for that lunatic. You shoulda stayed single, put the child up for adoption, and you'd be a free woman today. Angela cried harder and Delia took up the attack, Oh, stop it, Angela, stop it. You have nobody to blame but yourself for gettin' into trouble with a drunkard from the North, a man that doesn't even look like a Catholic, him with his odd manner. I'd say
that... that... Malachy has a streak of the Presbyterian in him right enough. You shuddup, Jimmy.
If I was you, said Philomena, I'd make sure there's no more children. He don't have a job, so he don't, an' never will the way he drinks. So... no more children, Angela. Are you listenin' to me?
I am, Philomena.
A year later another child was born. Angela called him Malachy after his father and gave him a middle name, Gerard, after his father's brother.
The MacNamara sisters said Angela was nothing but a rabbit and they wanted nothing to do with her till she came to her senses.
Their husbands agreed.
I'm in a playground on Classon Avenue in Brooklyn with my brother, Malachy. He's two, I'm three. We're on the seesaw.
Up, down, up, down.
Malachy goes up.
I get off.
Malachy goes down. Seesaw hits the ground. He screams. His hand is
on his mouth and there's blood.
Oh, God. Blood is bad. My mother will kill me.
And here she is, trying to run across the playground. Her big belly
slows her.
She says, What did you do? What did you do to I don't know what to say. I don't know what I She pulls my ear. Go home. Go to bed. Bed?
In the middle of the day?
She pushes me toward the playground gate. Go. She picks up Malachy and waddles off.
My father's friend, Mr. MacAdorey, is outside
the child?
did.
our building. He's standing at the edge of the sidewalk with his wife, Minnie, looking at a
dog lying in the gutter. There is blood all around the dog's head. It's the color of the blood from Malachy's mouth.
Malachy has dog blood and the dog has Malachy blood.
I pull Mr. MacAdorey's hand. I tell him Malachy has blood like the
dog.
Oh, he does, indeed, Francis. Cats have it, too. And Eskimos. All
the same blood.
Minnie says, Stop that, Dan. Stop confusing the wee fellow. She
tells me the poor wee dog was hit by a car and he crawled all the way from the middle of the street before he died. Wanted to come home, the poor wee creature.
Mr. MacAdorey says, You'd better go home, Francis. I don't know what you did to your wee brother, but your mother took him off to the hospital. Go home, child.
Will Malachy die like the dog, Mr. MacAdorey? Minnie says, He bit his tongue. He won't die. Why did the dog die?
It was his time, Francis.
The apartment is empty and I wander between the two rooms, the bedroom and the kitchen. My father is out looking for a job and my mother is at the hospital with Malachy. I wish I had something to eat but there's nothing in the icebox but cabbage leaves floating in the melted ice. My father said never eat anything floating in water for the rot that might be in it. I fall asleep on my parents' bed and when my mother
shakes me it's nearly dark. Your little brother is going to sleep a while. Nearly bit his tongue off. Stitches galore. Go into the other
room.
My father is in the kitchen sipping black tea from his big white
enamel mug. He lifts me to his lap.
Dad, will you tell me the story about Coo Coo?
Cuchulain. Say it after me, Coo-hoo-lin. I'll tell you the story
when you say the name right. Coo-hoo-lin.
I say it right and he tells me the story of Cuchulain, who had a
different name when he was a boy, Setanta. He grew up in Ireland where Dad lived when he was a boy in County Antrim. Setanta had a stick and ball and one day he hit the ball and it went into the mouth of a big dog that belonged to Culain and choked him. Oh, Culain was angry and he said, What am I to do now without my big dog to guard my house and my wife and my ten small children as well as numerous pigs, hens, sheep?
Setanta said, I'm sorry. I'll guard your house with my stick and ball and I'll change my name to Cuchulain, the Hound of Culain. He did. He guarded the house and regions beyond and became a great hero, the Hound of Ulster itself. Dad said he was a greater hero than Hercules or Achilles that the Greeks were always bragging about and he could take on King Arthur and all his knights in a fair fight which, of course, you could never get with an Englishman anyway.
That's my story. Dad can't tell that story to Malachy or any other children down the hall.
He finishes the story and lets me sip his tea. It's bitter, but I'm happy there on his lap.
For days Malachy's tongue is swollen and he can hardly make a sound never mind talk. But even if he could no one is paying any attention to him because we have two new babies who were brought by an angel in the middle of the night. The neighbors say, Ooh, Ah, they're lovely boys, look at those big eyes.
Malachy stands in the middle of the room, looking up at everyone, pointing to his tongue and saying, Uck, uck. When the neighbors say, Can't you see we're looking at your little brothers? he cries, till Dad pats him on the head. Put in your tongue, son, and go out and play with Frankie. Go on.
In the playground I tell Malachy about the dog who died in the street because someone drove a ball into his mouth. Malachy shakes his head. No uck ball. Car uck kill dog. He cries because his tongue hurts and he can hardly talk and it's terrible when you can't talk. He won't let me push him on the swing. He says, You uck kill me uck on seesaw. He gets Freddie Leibowitz to push him and he's happy, laughing when he swings to the sky. Freddie is big, he's seven, and I ask him to push me. He says, No, you tried to kill your brother.
I try to get the swing going myself but all I can do is move it back and forth and I'm angry because Freddie and Malachy are laughing at the way I can't swing. They're great pals now, Freddie, seven, Malachy, two. They laugh every day and Malachy's tongue gets better with all the laughing.
When he laughs you can see how white and small and pretty his teeth are and you can see his eyes shine. He has blue eyes like my mother. He has golden hair and pink cheeks. I have brown eyes like Dad. I have black hair and my cheeks are white in the mirror. My mother tells Mrs. Leibowitz down the hall that Malachy is the happiest child in the world.
She tells Mrs. Leibowitz down the hall, Frankie has the odd manner like his father. I wonder what the odd manner is but I can't ask because I'm not supposed to be listening.
I wish I could swing up into the sky, up into the clouds. I might be able to fly around the whole world and not hear my brothers, Oliver and Eugene, cry in the middle of the night anymore. My mother says they're always hungry. She cries in the middle of the night, too. She says she's worn out nursing and feeding and changing and four boys is too much for her. She wishes she had one little girl all for herself. She'd give anything for one little girl.
I'm in the playground with Malachy. I'm four, he's three. He lets me push him on the swing because he's no good at swinging himself and Freddie Leibowitz is in school. We have to stay in the playground because the twins are sleeping and my mother says she's worn out. Go out and play, she says, and give me some rest. Dad is out looking for a job again and sometimes he comes home with the smell of whiskey, singing all the songs about suffering Ireland. Mam gets angry and says Ireland can kiss her arse. He says that's nice language to be using in front of the children and she says never mind the language, food on the table is what she wants, not suffering Ireland. She says it was a sad day Prohibition ended because Dad gets the drink going around to saloons offering to sweep out the bars and lift barrels for a whiskey or a beer. Sometimes he brings home bits of the free lunch, rye bread, corned beef, pickles. He puts the food on the table and drinks tea himself. He says food is a shock to the system and he doesn't know where we get our appetites. Mam
says,
They get their appetites because they're starving half the time.
When Dad gets a job Mam is cheerful and she sings, Anyone can see why I wanted your kiss,
It had to be and the reason is this
Could it be true, someone like you
Could love me, love me?
When Dad brings home the first week's wages Mam is delighted she can pay the lovely Italian man in the grocery shop and she can hold her head up again because there's nothing worse in the world than to owe and be beholden to anyone. She cleans the kitchen, washes the mugs and plates, brushes crumbs and bits of food from the table, cleans out the icebox and orders a fresh block of ice from another Italian. She buys toilet paper that we can take down the hall to the lavatory and that, she says, is better than having the headlines from the Daily News blackening your arse. She boils water on the stove and spends a day at a great tin tub washing our shirts and socks, diapers for the twins, our two sheets, our three towels. She hangs everything out on the clotheslines behind the apartment house and we can watch the clothes dance in wind and sun. She says you wouldn't want the neighbors to know what you have in the way of a wash but there's nothing like the sweetness of clothes dried by the sun.
When Dad brings home the first week's wages on a Friday night we know the weekend will be wonderful. On Saturday night Mam will boil water on the stove and wash us in the great tin tub and Dad will dry us. Malachy will turn around and show his behind. Dad will pretend to be shocked and we'll all laugh. Mam will make hot cocoa and we'll be able to stay up while Dad tells us a story out of his head. All we have to do is
say a name, Mr. MacAdorey or Mr. Leibowitz down the hall, and Dad will have the two of them rowing up a river in Brazil chased by Indians with green noses and puce shoulders. On nights like that we can drift off to sleep knowing there will be a breakfast of eggs, fried tomatoes and fried bread, tea with lashings of sugar and milk and, later in the day, a big dinner of mashed potatoes, peas and ham, and a trifle Mam makes, layers of fruit and warm delicious custard on a cake soaked in sherry.
When Dad brings home the first week's wages and the weather is fine Mam takes us to the playground. She sits on a bench and talks to Minnie MacAdorey. She tells Minnie stories about characters in Limerick and Minnie tells her about characters in Belfast and they laugh because there are funny people in Ireland, North and South. Then they teach each other sad songs and Malachy and I leave the swings and see-saws to sit with them on the bench and sing, A group of young soldiers one night in a camp Were talking of sweethearts they had.
All seemed so merry except one young lad, And he was downhearted and sad.
Come and join us, said one of the boys, Surely there's someone for you.
But Ned shook his head and proudly he said I am in love with two, Each like a mother to me,
From neither of them shall I part.
For one is my mother,
God bless her and love her,
The other is my sweetheart.
Malachy and I sing that song and Mam and Minnie laugh till they cry at the way Malachy takes a deep bow and holds his arms out to Mam at the end. Dan MacAdorey comes along on his way home from work and says Rudy Vallee better start worrying about the competition.
When we go home Mam makes tea and bread and jam or mashed potatoes with butter and salt. Dad drinks the tea and eats nothing. Mam says, God above, How can you work all day and not eat? He says, The tea is enough. She says, You'll ruin your health, and he tells her again that food is a shock to the system. He drinks his tea and tells us stories and shows us letters and words in the Daily News or he smokes a cigarette, stares at the wall, runs his tongue over his lips.
When Dad's job goes into the third week he does not bring home the wages. On Friday night we wait for him and Mam gives us bread and tea. The darkness comes down and the lights come on along Classon Avenue. Other men with jobs are home already and having eggs for dinner because you can't have meat on a Friday. You can hear the families talking upstairs and downstairs and down the hall and Bing Crosby is singing on the radio, Brother, can you spare a dime?
Malachy and I play with the twins. We know Mam won't sing Anyone can see why I wanted your kiss. She sits at the kitchen table talking to herself, What am I going to do? till it's late and Dad rolls up the stairs singing Roddy McCorley.

Mam says, Leave those boys alone. They're gone to bed half hungry because you have to fill your belly with whiskey.

On the morning of the fourth Friday of Dad's job Mam asks him if he'll be home tonight with his wages or will he drink everything again? He looks at us and shakes his head at Mam as if to say, Och, you shouldn't talk like that in front of the children.
Mam keeps at him. I'm asking you, Are you coming home so that we can have a bit of supper or will it be midnight with no money in your pocket and you singing Kevin Barry and the rest of the sad songs?

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†We might have gone about half a mile, and my pocket-handkerchief was quite wet through, when the carrier stopped short. Looking out to ascertain for what, I saw, to MY amazement, Peggotty burst from a hedge and climb into the cart. She took me in both her arms, and squeezed me to her stays until the pressure on my nose was extremely painful, though I never thought of that till afterwards when I found it very tender. Not a single word did Peggotty speak. Releasing one of her arms, she put it down in her pocket to the elbow, and brought out some paper bags of cakes which she crammed into my pockets, and a purse which she put into my hand, but not one word did she say. After another and a final squeeze with both arms, she got down from the cart and ran away; and, my belief is, and has always been, without a solitary button on her gown. I picked up one, of several that were rolling about, and treasured it as a keepsake for a long time.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†The carrier looked at me, as if to inquire if she were coming back. I shook my head, and said I thought not. 'Then come up,' said the carrier to the lazy horse; who came up accordingly.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Having by this time cried as much as I possibly could, I began to think it was of no use crying any more, especially as neither Roderick Random, nor that Captain in the Royal British Navy, had ever cried, that I could remember, in trying situations. The carrier, seeing me in this resolution, proposed that my pocket-handkerchief should be spread upon the horse's back to dry. I thanked him, and assented; and particularly small it looked, under those circumstances.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†I had now leisure to examine the purse. It was a stiff leather purse, with a snap, and had three bright shillings in it, which Peggotty had evidently polished up with whitening, for my greater delight. But its most precious contents were two half-crowns folded together in a bit of paper, on which was written, in my mother's hand, 'For Davy. With my love.' I was so overcome by this, that I asked the carrier to be so good as to reach me my pocket-handkerchief again; but he said he thought I had better do without it, and I thought I really had, so I wiped my eyes on my sleeve and stopped myself.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†For good, too; though, in consequence of my previous emotions, I was still occasionally seized with a stormy sob. After we had jogged on for some little time, I asked the carrier if he was going all the way.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†'All the way where?' inquired the carrier.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†'There,' I said.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†'Where's there?' inquired the carrier.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†'Near London,' I said.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†'Why that horse,' said the carrier, jerking the rein to point him out, 'would be deader than pork afore he got over half the ground.'
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†'Are you only going to Yarmouth then?' I asked.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†'That's about it,' said the carrier. 'And there I shall take you to the stage-cutch, and the stage-cutch that'll take you to‚Äîwherever it is.'
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†As this was a great deal for the carrier (whose name was Mr. Barkis) to say‚Äîhe being, as I observed in a former chapter, of a phlegmatic temperament, and not at all conversational‚ÄîI offered him a cake as a mark of attention, which he ate at one gulp, exactly like an elephant, and which made no more impression on his big face than it would have done on an elephant's.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†'Did SHE make 'em, now?' said Mr. Barkis, always leaning forward, in his slouching way, on the footboard of the cart with an arm on each knee.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†'Peggotty, do you mean, sir?'
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†'Ah!' said Mr. Barkis. 'Her.'
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†'Yes. She makes all our pastry, and does all our cooking.'
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†'Do she though?' said Mr. Barkis. He made up his mouth as if to whistle, but he didn't whistle. He sat looking at the horse's ears, as if he saw something new there; and sat so, for a considerable time. By and by, he said:
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†'No sweethearts, I b'lieve?'
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†'Sweetmeats did you say, Mr. Barkis?' For I thought he wanted something else to eat, and had pointedly alluded to that description of refreshment.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†'Hearts,' said Mr. Barkis. 'Sweet hearts; no person walks with her!'
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†'With Peggotty?'
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†'Ah!' he said. 'Her.'
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†'Oh, no. She never had a sweetheart.'
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†'Didn't she, though!' said Mr. Barkis.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Again he made up his mouth to whistle, and again he didn't whistle, but sat looking at the horse's ears.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†'So she makes,' said Mr. Barkis, after a long interval of reflection, 'all the apple parsties, and doos all the cooking, do she?'
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†I replied that such was the fact.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†'Well. I'll tell you what,' said Mr. Barkis. 'P'raps you might be writin' to her?'
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†'I shall certainly write to her,' I rejoined.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†'Ah!' he said, slowly turning his eyes towards me. 'Well! If you was writin' to her, p'raps you'd recollect to say that Barkis was willin'; would you?'
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†'That Barkis is willing,' I repeated, innocently. 'Is that all the message?'
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†'Ye-es,' he said, considering. 'Ye-es. Barkis is willin'.'
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†'But you will be at Blunderstone again tomorrow, Mr. Barkis,' I said, faltering a little at the idea of my being far away from it then, and could give your own message so much better.'
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†As he repudiated this suggestion, however, with a jerk of his head, and once more confirmed his previous request by saying, with profound gravity, 'Barkis is willin'. That's the message,' I readily undertook its transmission. While I was waiting for the coach in the hotel at Yarmouth that very afternoon, I procured a sheet of paper and an inkstand, and wrote a note to Peggotty, which ran thus: 'My dear Peggotty. I have come here safe. Barkis is willing. My love to mama. Yours affectionately. P.S. He says he particularly wants you to know‚ÄîBARKIS IS WILLING.'
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†When I had taken this commission on myself prospectively, Mr. Barkis relapsed into perfect silence; and I, feeling quite worn out by all that had happened lately, lay down on a sack in the cart and fell asleep. I slept soundly until we got to Yarmouth; which was so entirely new and strange to me in the inn-yard to which we drove, that I at once abandoned a latent hope I had had of meeting with some of Mr. Peggotty's family there, perhaps even with little Em'ly herself.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†The coach was in the yard, shining very much all over, but without any horses to it as yet; and it looked in that state as if nothing was more unlikely than its ever going to London. I was thinking this, and wondering what would ultimately become of my box, which Mr. Barkis had put down on the yard-pavement by the pole (he having driven up the yard to turn his cart), and also what would ultimately become of me, when a lady looked out of a bow-window where some fowls and joints of meat were hanging up, and said:
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†'Is that the little gentleman from Blunderstone?'
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†'Yes, ma'am,' I said.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†'What name?' inquired the lady.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†'Copperfield, ma'am,' I said.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†'That won't do,' returned the lady. 'Nobody's dinner is paid for here, in that name.'
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†'Is it Murdstone, ma'am?' I said.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†'If you're Master Murdstone,' said the lady, 'why do you go and give another name, first?'
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†I explained to the lady how it was, who than rang a bell, and called out, 'William! show the coffee-room!' upon which a waiter came running out of a kitchen on the opposite side of the yard to show it, and seemed a good deal surprised when he was only to show it to me.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†It was a large long room with some large maps in it. I doubt if I could have felt much stranger if the maps had been real foreign countries, and I cast away in the middle of them. I felt it was taking a liberty to sit down, with my cap in my hand, on the corner of the chair nearest the door; and when the waiter laid a cloth on purpose for me, and put a set of castors on it, I think I must have turned red all over with modesty.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†He brought me some chops, and vegetables, and took the covers off in such a bouncing manner that I was afraid I must have given him some offence. But he greatly relieved my mind by putting a chair for me at the table, and saying, very affably, 'Now, six-foot! come on!'
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†I thanked him, and took my seat at the board; but found it extremely difficult to handle my knife and fork with anything like dexterity, or to avoid splashing myself with the gravy, while he was standing opposite, staring so hard, and making me blush in the most dreadful manner every time I caught his eye. After watching me into the second chop, he said:
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†'There's half a pint of ale for you. Will you have it now?'
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†I thanked him and said, 'Yes.' Upon which he poured it out of a jug into a large tumbler, and held it up against the light, and made it look beautiful.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†'My eye!' he said. 'It seems a good deal, don't it?'
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†'It does seem a good deal,' I answered with a smile. For it was quite delightful to me, to find him so pleasant. He was a twinkling-eyed, pimple-faced man, with his hair standing upright all over his head; and as he stood with one arm a-kimbo, holding up the glass to the light with the other hand, he looked quite friendly.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†'There was a gentleman here, yesterday,' he said‚Äî'a stout gentleman, by the name of Topsawyer‚Äîperhaps you know him?'
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†'No,' I said, 'I don't think‚Äî'
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†'In breeches and gaiters, broad-brimmed hat, grey coat, speckled choker,' said the waiter.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†'No,' I said bashfully, 'I haven't the pleasure‚Äî'
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†'He came in here,' said the waiter, looking at the light through the tumbler, 'ordered a glass of this ale‚ÄîWOULD order it‚ÄîI told him not‚Äîdrank it, and fell dead. It was too old for him. It oughtn't to be drawn; that's the fact.'
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†I was very much shocked to hear of this melancholy accident, and said I thought I had better have some water.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†'Why you see,' said the waiter, still looking at the light through the tumbler, with one of his eyes shut up, 'our people don't like things being ordered and left. It offends 'em. But I'll drink it, if you like. I'm used to it, and use is everything. I don't think it'll hurt me, if I throw my head back, and take it off quick. Shall I?'
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†I replied that he would much oblige me by drinking it, if he thought he could do it safely, but by no means otherwise. When he did throw his head back, and take it off quick, I had a horrible fear, I confess, of seeing him meet the fate of the lamented Mr. Topsawyer, and fall lifeless on the carpet. But it didn't hurt him. On the contrary, I thought he seemed the fresher for it.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†'What have we got here?' he said, putting a fork into my dish. 'Not chops?'
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†'Chops,' I said.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†'Lord bless my soul!' he exclaimed, 'I didn't know they were chops. Why, a chop's the very thing to take off the bad effects of that beer! Ain't it lucky?'
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†So he took a chop by the bone in one hand, and a potato in the other, and ate away with a very good appetite, to my extreme satisfaction. He afterwards took another chop, and another potato; and after that, another chop and another potato. When we had done, he brought me a pudding, and having set it before me, seemed to ruminate, and to become absent in his mind for some moments.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†'How's the pie?' he said, rousing himself.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†'It's a pudding,' I made answer.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†'Pudding!' he exclaimed. 'Why, bless me, so it is! What!' looking at it nearer. 'You don't mean to say it's a batter-pudding!'
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†'Yes, it is indeed.'
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†'Why, a batter-pudding,' he said, taking up a table-spoon, 'is my favourite pudding! Ain't that lucky? Come on, little 'un, and let's see who'll get most.'
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†The waiter certainly got most. He entreated me more than once to come in and win, but what with his table-spoon to my tea-spoon, his dispatch to my dispatch, and his appetite to my appetite, I was left far behind at the first mouthful, and had no chance with him. I never saw anyone enjoy a pudding so much, I think; and he laughed, when it was all gone, as if his enjoyment of it lasted still.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Finding him so very friendly and companionable, it was then that I asked for the pen and ink and paper, to write to Peggotty. He not only brought it immediately, but was good enough to look over me while I wrote the letter. When I had finished it, he asked me where I was going to school.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†I said, 'Near London,' which was all I knew.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†'Oh! my eye!' he said, looking very low-spirited, 'I am sorry for that.'
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†'Why?' I asked him.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†'Oh, Lord!' he said, shaking his head, 'that's the school where they broke the boy's ribs‚Äîtwo ribs‚Äîa little boy he was. I should say he was‚Äîlet me see‚Äîhow old are you, about?'
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†I told him between eight and nine.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†'That's just his age,' he said. 'He was eight years and six months old when they broke his first rib; eight years and eight months old when they broke his second, and did for him.'
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†I could not disguise from myself, or from the waiter, that this was an uncomfortable coincidence, and inquired how it was done. His answer was not cheering to my spirits, for it consisted of two dismal words, 'With whopping.'
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†The blowing of the coach-horn in the yard was a seasonable diversion, which made me get up and hesitatingly inquire, in the mingled pride and diffidence of having a purse (which I took out of my pocket), if there were anything to pay.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†'There's a sheet of letter-paper,' he returned. 'Did you ever buy a sheet of letter-paper?'
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†I could not remember that I ever had.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†'It's dear,' he said, 'on account of the duty. Threepence. That's the way we're taxed in this country. There's nothing else, except the waiter. Never mind the ink. I lose by that.'
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†'What should you‚Äîwhat should I‚Äîhow much ought I to‚Äîwhat would it be right to pay the waiter, if you please?' I stammered, blushing.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†'If I hadn't a family, and that family hadn't the cowpock,' said the waiter, 'I wouldn't take a sixpence. If I didn't support a aged pairint, and a lovely sister,'‚Äîhere the waiter was greatly agitated‚Äî'I wouldn't take a farthing. If I had a good place, and was treated well here, I should beg acceptance of a trifle, instead of taking of it. But I live on broken wittles‚Äîand I sleep on the coals'‚Äîhere the waiter burst into tears.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†I was very much concerned for his misfortunes, and felt that any recognition short of ninepence would be mere brutality and hardness of heart. Therefore I gave him one of my three bright shillings, which he received with much humility and veneration, and spun up with his thumb, directly afterwards, to try the goodness of.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†It was a little disconcerting to me, to find, when I was being helped up behind the coach, that I was supposed to have eaten all the dinner without any assistance. I discovered this, from overhearing the lady in the bow-window say to the guard, 'Take care of that child, George, or he'll burst!' and from observing that the women-servants who were about the place came out to look and giggle at me as a young phenomenon. My unfortunate friend the waiter, who had quite recovered his spirits, did not appear to be disturbed by this, but joined in the general admiration without being at all confused. If I had any doubt of him, I suppose this half awakened it; but I am inclined to believe that with the simple confidence of a child, and the natural reliance of a child upon superior years (qualities I am very sorry any children should prematurely change for worldly wisdom), I had no serious mistrust of him on the whole, even then.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†I felt it rather hard, I must own, to be made, without deserving it, the subject of jokes between the coachman and guard as to the coach drawing heavy behind, on account of my sitting there, and as to the greater expediency of my travelling by waggon. The story of my supposed appetite getting wind among the outside passengers, they were merry upon it likewise; and asked me whether I was going to be paid for, at school, as two brothers or three, and whether I was contracted for, or went upon the regular terms; with other pleasant questions. But the worst of it was, that I knew I should be ashamed to eat anything, when an opportunity offered, and that, after a rather light dinner, I should remain hungry all night‚Äîfor I had left my cakes behind, at the hotel, in my hurry. My apprehensions were realized. When we stopped for supper I couldn't muster courage to take any, though I should have liked it very much, but sat by the fire and said I didn't want anything. This did not save me from more jokes, either; for a husky-voiced gentleman with a rough face, who had been eating out of a sandwich-box nearly all the way, except when he had been drinking out of a bottle, said I was like a boa-constrictor who took enough at one meal to last him a long time; after which, he actually brought a rash out upon himself with boiled beef.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†We had started from Yarmouth at three o'clock in the afternoon, and we were due in London about eight next morning. It was Mid-summer weather, and the evening was very pleasant. When we passed through a village, I pictured to myself what the insides of the houses were like, and what the inhabitants were about; and when boys came running after us, and got up behind and swung there for a little way, I wondered whether their fathers were alive, and whether they Were happy at home. I had plenty to think of, therefore, besides my mind running continually on the kind of place I was going to‚Äîwhich was an awful speculation. Sometimes, I remember, I resigned myself to thoughts of home and Peggotty; and to endeavouring, in a confused blind way, to recall how I had felt, and what sort of boy I used to be, before I bit Mr. Murdstone: which I couldn't satisfy myself about by any means, I seemed to have bitten him in such a remote antiquity.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†The night was not so pleasant as the evening, for it got chilly; and being put between two gentlemen (the rough-faced one and another) to prevent my tumbling off the coach, I was nearly smothered by their falling asleep, and completely blocking me up. They squeezed me so hard sometimes, that I could not help crying out, 'Oh! If you please!'‚Äîwhich they didn't like at all, because it woke them. Opposite me was an elderly lady in a great fur cloak, who looked in the dark more like a haystack than a lady, she was wrapped up to such a degree. This lady had a basket with her, and she hadn't known what to do with it, for a long time, until she found that on account of my legs being short, it could go underneath me. It cramped and hurt me so, that it made me perfectly miserable; but if I moved in the least, and made a glass that was in the basket rattle against something else (as it was sure to do), she gave me the cruellest poke with her foot, and said, 'Come, don't YOU fidget. YOUR bones are young enough, I'm sure!'
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†At last the sun rose, and then my companions seemed to sleep easier. The difficulties under which they had laboured all night, and which had found utterance in the most terrific gasps and snorts, are not to be conceived. As the sun got higher, their sleep became lighter, and so they gradually one by one awoke. I recollect being very much surprised by the feint everybody made, then, of not having been to sleep at all, and by the uncommon indignation with which everyone repelled the charge. I labour under the same kind of astonishment to this day, having invariably observed that of all human weaknesses, the one to which our common nature is the least disposed to confess (I cannot imagine why) is the weakness of having gone to sleep in a coach.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†What an amazing place London was to me when I saw it in the distance, and how I believed all the adventures of all my favourite heroes to be constantly enacting and re-enacting there, and how I vaguely made it out in my own mind to be fuller of wonders and wickedness than all the cities of the earth, I need not stop here to relate. We approached it by degrees, and got, in due time, to the inn in the Whitechapel district, for which we were bound. I forget whether it was the Blue Bull, or the Blue Boar; but I know it was the Blue Something, and that its likeness was painted up on the back of the coach.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†The guard's eye lighted on me as he was getting down, and he said at the booking-office door:
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†'Is there anybody here for a yoongster booked in the name of Murdstone, from Bloonderstone, Sooffolk, to be left till called for?'
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Nobody answered.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†'Try Copperfield, if you please, sir,' said I, looking helplessly down.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†'Is there anybody here for a yoongster, booked in the name of Murdstone, from Bloonderstone, Sooffolk, but owning to the name of Copperfield, to be left till called for?' said the guard. 'Come! IS there anybody?'
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†No. There was nobody. I looked anxiously around; but the inquiry made no impression on any of the bystanders, if I except a man in gaiters, with one eye, who suggested that they had better put a brass collar round my neck, and tie me up in the stable.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†A ladder was brought, and I got down after the lady, who was like a haystack: not daring to stir, until her basket was removed. The coach was clear of passengers by that time, the luggage was very soon cleared out, the horses had been taken out before the luggage, and now the coach itself was wheeled and backed off by some hostlers, out of the way. Still, nobody appeared, to claim the dusty youngster from Blunderstone, Suffolk.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†More solitary than Robinson Crusoe, who had nobody to look at him and see that he was solitary, I went into the booking-office, and, by invitation of the clerk on duty, passed behind the counter, and sat down on the scale at which they weighed the luggage. Here, as I sat looking at the parcels, packages, and books, and inhaling the smell of stables (ever since associated with that morning), a procession of most tremendous considerations began to march through my mind. Supposing nobody should ever fetch me, how long would they consent to keep me there? Would they keep me long enough to spend seven shillings? Should I sleep at night in one of those wooden bins, with the other luggage, and wash myself at the pump in the yard in the morning; or should I be turned out every night, and expected to come again to be left till called for, when the office opened next day? Supposing there was no mistake in the case, and Mr. Murdstone had devised this plan to get rid of me, what should I do? If they allowed me to remain there until my seven shillings were spent, I couldn't hope to remain there when I began to starve. That would obviously be inconvenient and unpleasant to the customers, besides entailing on the Blue Whatever-it-was, the risk of funeral expenses. If I started off at once, and tried to walk back home, how could I ever find my way, how could I ever hope to walk so far, how could I make sure of anyone but Peggotty, even if I got back? If I found out the nearest proper authorities, and offered myself to go for a soldier, or a sailor, I was such a little fellow that it was most likely they wouldn't take me in. These thoughts, and a hundred other such thoughts, turned me burning hot, and made me giddy with apprehension and dismay. I was in the height of my fever when a man entered and whispered to the clerk, who presently slanted me off the scale, and pushed me over to him, as if I were weighed, bought, delivered, and paid for.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†As I went out of the office, hand in hand with this new acquaintance, I stole a look at him. He was a gaunt, sallow young man, with hollow cheeks, and a chin almost as black as Mr. Murdstone's; but there the likeness ended, for his whiskers were shaved off, and his hair, instead of being glossy, was rusty and dry. He was dressed in a suit of black clothes which were rather rusty and dry too, and rather short in the sleeves and legs; and he had a white neck-kerchief on, that was not over-clean. I did not, and do not, suppose that this neck-kerchief was all the linen he wore, but it was all he showed or gave any hint of.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†'You're the new boy?' he said. 'Yes, sir,' I said.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†I supposed I was. I didn't know.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†'I'm one of the masters at Salem House,' he said.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†I made him a bow and felt very much overawed. I was so ashamed to allude to a commonplace thing like my box, to a scholar and a master at Salem House, that we had gone some little distance from the yard before I had the hardihood to mention it. We turned back, on my humbly insinuating that it might be useful to me hereafter; and he told the clerk that the carrier had instructions to call for it at noon.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†'If you please, sir,' I said, when we had accomplished about the same distance as before, 'is it far?'
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†'It's down by Blackheath,' he said.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†'Is that far, sir?' I diffidently asked.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†'It's a good step,' he said. 'We shall go by the stage-coach. It's about six miles.'
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†I was so faint and tired, that the idea of holding out for six miles more, was too much for me. I took heart to tell him that I had had nothing all night, and that if he would allow me to buy something to eat, I should be very much obliged to him. He appeared surprised at this‚ÄîI see him stop and look at me now‚Äîand after considering for a few moments, said he wanted to call on an old person who lived not far off, and that the best way would be for me to buy some bread, or whatever I liked best that was wholesome, and make my breakfast at her house, where we could get some milk.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Accordingly we looked in at a baker's window, and after I had made a series of proposals to buy everything that was bilious in the shop, and he had rejected them one by one, we decided in favour of a nice little loaf of brown bread, which cost me threepence. Then, at a grocer's shop, we bought an egg and a slice of streaky bacon; which still left what I thought a good deal of change, out of the second of the bright shillings, and made me consider London a very cheap place. These provisions laid in, we went on through a great noise and uproar that confused my weary head beyond description, and over a bridge which, no doubt, was London Bridge (indeed I think he told me so, but I was half asleep), until we came to the poor person's house, which was a part of some alms-houses, as I knew by their look, and by an inscription on a stone over the gate which said they were established for twenty-five poor women.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†The Master at Salem House lifted the latch of one of a number of little black doors that were all alike, and had each a little diamond-paned window on one side, and another little diamond‚Äîpaned window above; and we went into the little house of one of these poor old women, who was blowing a fire to make a little saucepan boil. On seeing the master enter, the old woman stopped with the bellows on her knee, and said something that I thought sounded like 'My Charley!' but on seeing me come in too, she got up, and rubbing her hands made a confused sort of half curtsey.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†'Can you cook this young gentleman's breakfast for him, if you please?' said the Master at Salem House.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†'Can I?' said the old woman. 'Yes can I, sure!'
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†'How's Mrs. Fibbitson today?' said the Master, looking at another old woman in a large chair by the fire, who was such a bundle of clothes that I feel grateful to this hour for not having sat upon her by mistake.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†'Ah, she's poorly,' said the first old woman. 'It's one of her bad days. If the fire was to go out, through any accident, I verily believe she'd go out too, and never come to life again.'
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†As they looked at her, I looked at her also. Although it was a warm day, she seemed to think of nothing but the fire. I fancied she was jealous even of the saucepan on it; and I have reason to know that she took its impressment into the service of boiling my egg and broiling my bacon, in dudgeon; for I saw her, with my own discomfited eyes, shake her fist at me once, when those culinary operations were going on, and no one else was looking. The sun streamed in at the little window, but she sat with her own back and the back of the large chair towards it, screening the fire as if she were sedulously keeping IT warm, instead of it keeping her warm, and watching it in a most distrustful manner. The completion of the preparations for my breakfast, by relieving the fire, gave her such extreme joy that she laughed aloud‚Äîand a very unmelodious laugh she had, I must say.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†I sat down to my brown loaf, my egg, and my rasher of bacon, with a basin of milk besides, and made a most delicious meal. While I was yet in the full enjoyment of it, the old woman of the house said to the Master:
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†'Have you got your flute with you?'
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†'Yes,' he returned.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†'Have a blow at it,' said the old woman, coaxingly. 'Do!'
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†The Master, upon this, put his hand underneath the skirts of his coat, and brought out his flute in three pieces, which he screwed together, and began immediately to play. My impression is, after many years of consideration, that there never can have been anybody in the world who played worse. He made the most dismal sounds I have ever heard produced by any means, natural or artificial. I don't know what the tunes were‚Äîif there were such things in the performance at all, which I doubt‚Äîbut the influence of the strain upon me was, first, to make me think of all my sorrows until I could hardly keep my tears back; then to take away my appetite; and lastly, to make me so sleepy that I couldn't keep my eyes open. They begin to close again, and I begin to nod, as the recollection rises fresh upon me. Once more the little room, with its open corner cupboard, and its square-backed chairs, and its angular little staircase leading to the room above, and its three peacock's feathers displayed over the mantelpiece‚ÄîI remember wondering when I first went in, what that peacock would have thought if he had known what his finery was doomed to come to‚Äîfades from before me, and I nod, and sleep. The flute becomes inaudible, the wheels of the coach are heard instead, and I am on my journey. The coach jolts, I wake with a start, and the flute has come back again, and the Master at Salem House is sitting with his legs crossed, playing it dolefully, while the old woman of the house looks on delighted. She fades in her turn, and he fades, and all fades, and there is no flute, no Master, no Salem House, no David Copperfield, no anything but heavy sleep.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†I dreamed, I thought, that once while he was blowing into this dismal flute, the old woman of the house, who had gone nearer and nearer to him in her ecstatic admiration, leaned over the back of his chair and gave him an affectionate squeeze round the neck, which stopped his playing for a moment. I was in the middle state between sleeping and waking, either then or immediately afterwards; for, as he resumed‚Äîit was a real fact that he had stopped playing‚ÄîI saw and heard the same old woman ask Mrs. Fibbitson if it wasn't delicious (meaning the flute), to which Mrs. Fibbitson replied, 'Ay, ay! yes!' and nodded at the fire: to which, I am persuaded, she gave the credit of the whole performance.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†When I seemed to have been dozing a long while, the Master at Salem House unscrewed his flute into the three pieces, put them up as before, and took me away. We found the coach very near at hand, and got upon the roof; but I was so dead sleepy, that when we stopped on the road to take up somebody else, they put me inside where there were no passengers, and where I slept profoundly, until I found the coach going at a footpace up a steep hill among green leaves. Presently, it stopped, and had come to its destination.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†A short walk brought us‚ÄîI mean the Master and me‚Äîto Salem House, which was enclosed with a high brick wall, and looked very dull. Over a door in this wall was a board with SALEM HOUSE upon it; and through a grating in this door we were surveyed when we rang the bell by a surly face, which I found, on the door being opened, belonged to a stout man with a bull-neck, a wooden leg, overhanging temples, and his hair cut close all round his head.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†'The new boy,' said the Master.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†The man with the wooden leg eyed me all over‚Äîit didn't take long, for there was not much of me‚Äîand locked the gate behind us, and took out the key. We were going up to the house, among some dark heavy trees, when he called after my conductor. 'Hallo!'
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†We looked back, and he was standing at the door of a little lodge, where he lived, with a pair of boots in his hand.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†'Here! The cobbler's been,' he said, 'since you've been out, Mr. Mell, and he says he can't mend 'em any more. He says there ain't a bit of the original boot left, and he wonders you expect it.'
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†With these words he threw the boots towards Mr. Mell, who went back a few paces to pick them up, and look",en,LABEL_0,0.5512083768844604,LABEL_1,0.44879159331321716

A Memoir of a Childhood
By Frank McCourt
This book is dedicated to my brothers, Malachy, Michael, Alphonsus. I learn from you, I admire you and I love you.
Acknowledgments
This is a small hymn to an exaltation of women.
R'lene Dahlberg fanned the embers.
Lisa Schwarzbaum read early pages and encouraged me.
Mary Breasted Smyth, elegant novelist herself, read the first third
and passed it on to Molly Friedrich, who became my agent and thought that Nan Graham, Editor-in-Chief at Scribner, would be just the right person to put the book on the road.
And Molly was right.
My daughter, Maggie, has shown me how life can be a grand adventure, while exquisite moments with my granddaughter, Chiara, have helped me recall a small child's wonder.
My wife, Ellen, listened while I read and cheered me to the final
page.
I am blessed among men.

I
My father and mother should have stayed in New York where they met and married and where I was born. Instead, they returned to Ireland when I was four, my brother, Malachy, three, the twins, Oliver and Eugene, barely one, and my sister, Margaret, dead and gone.
When I look back on my childhood I wonder how I survived at all. It was, of course, a miserable childhood: the happy childhood is hardly worth your while. Worse than the ordinary miserable childhood is the miserable Irish childhood, and worse yet is the miserable Irish Catholic childhood.
People everywhere brag and whimper about the woes of their early years, but nothing can compare with the Irish version: the poverty; the shiftless loquacious alcoholic father; the pious defeated mother moaning by the fire; pompous priests; bullying schoolmasters; the English and the terrible things they did to us for eight hundred long years.
Above all-we were wet.
Out in the Atlantic Ocean great sheets of rain gathered to drift slowly up the River Shannon and settle forever in Limerick. The rain dampened the city from the Feast of the Circumcision to New Year's Eve.
It created a cacophony of hacking coughs, bronchial rattles, asthmatic wheezes, consumptive croaks. It turned noses into fountains, lungs into bacterial sponges. It provoked cures galore; to ease the catarrh you boiled onions in milk blackened with pepper; for the congested passages you made a paste of boiled flour and nettles, wrapped it in a rag, and slapped it, sizzling, on the chest.
From October to April the walls of Limerick glistened with the damp. Clothes never dried: tweed and woolen coats housed living things, sometimes sprouted mysterious vegetations. In pubs, steam rose from damp bodies and garments to be inhaled with cigarette and pipe smoke laced with the stale fumes of spilled stout and whiskey and tinged with the odor of piss wafting in from the outdoor jakes where many a man puked up his week's wages.
The rain drove us into the church-our refuge, our strength, our only dry place. At Mass, Benediction, novenas, we huddled in great damp clumps, dozing through priest drone, while steam rose again from our clothes to mingle with the sweetness of incense, flowers and candles.
Limerick gained a reputation for piety, but we knew it was only the
rain.
My father, Malachy McCourt, was born on a farm in Toome, County
Antrim. Like his father before, he grew up wild, in trouble with the English, or the Irish, or both. He fought with the Old IRA and for some desperate act he wound up a fugitive with a price on his head.
When I was a child I would look at my father, the thinning hair, the collapsing teeth, and wonder why anyone would give money for a head like that. When I was thirteen my father's mother told me a secret: as a wee lad your poor father was dropped on his head. It was an accident, he was never the same after, and you must remember that people dropped on their heads can be a bit peculiar.
Because of the price on the head he had been dropped on, he had to be spirited out of Ireland via cargo ship from Galway. In New York, with Prohibition in full swing, he thought he had died and gone to hell for his sins. Then he discovered speakeasies and he rejoiced.
After wandering and drinking in America and England he yearned for peace in his declining years. He returned to Belfast, which erupted all around him. He said, A pox on all their houses, and chatted with the ladies of Andersontown. They tempted him with delicacies but he waved them away and drank his tea. He no longer smoked or touched alcohol, so what was the use? It was time to go and he died in the Royal Victoria Hospital.
My mother, the former Angela Sheehan, grew up in a Limerick slum with her mother, two brothers, Thomas and Patrick, and a sister, Agnes. She never saw her father, who had run off to Australia weeks before her birth.
After a night of drinking porter in the pubs of Limerick he staggers down the lane singing his favorite song, Who threw the overalls in Mrs. Murphy's chowder?
Nobody spoke so he said it all the louder It's a dirty Irish trick and I can lick the Mick Who threw the overalls in Murphy's chowder.
He's in great form altogether and he thinks he'll play a while with little Patrick, one year old. Lovely little fella. Loves his daddy. Laughs when Daddy throws him up in the air. Upsy daisy, little Paddy, upsy daisy, up in the air in the dark, so dark, oh, Jasus, you miss the child on the way down and poor little Patrick lands on his head, gurgles
a bit, whimpers, goes quiet. Grandma heaves herself from the bed, heavy with the child in her belly, my mother. She's barely able to lift little Patrick from the floor. She moans a long moan over the child and turns on Grandpa. Get out of it. Out. If you stay here a minute longer I'll take the hatchet to you, you drunken lunatic. By Jesus, I'll swing at the end of a rope for you. Get out.
Grandpa stands his ground like a man. I have a right, he says, to stay in me own house.
She runs at him and he melts before this whirling dervish with a damaged child in her arms and a healthy one stirring inside. He stumbles from the house, up the lane, and doesn't stop till he reaches Melbourne in Australia.
Little Pat, my uncle, was never the same after. He grew up soft in the head with a left leg that went one way, his body the other. He never learned to read or write but God blessed him in another way. When he started to sell newspapers at the age of eight he could count money better than the Chancellor of the Exchequer himself. No one knew why he was called Ab Sheehan, The Abbot, but all Limerick loved him.
My mother's troubles began the night she was born. There is my grandmother in the bed heaving and gasping with the labor pains, praying to St. Gerard Majella, patron saint of expectant mothers. There is Nurse O'Halloran, the midwife, all dressed up in her finery. It's New Year's Eve and Mrs. O'Halloran is anxious for this child to be born so that she can rush off to the parties and celebrations. She tells my grandmother: Will you push, will you, push. Jesus, Mary and holy St. Joseph, if you don't hurry with this child it won't be born till the New Year and what good is that to me with me new dress? Never mind St. Gerard Majella. What can a man do for a woman at a time like this even if he is a saint? St. Gerard Majella my arse.
My grandmother switches her prayers to St. Ann, patron saint of difficult labor. But the child won't come. Nurse O'Halloran tells my grandmother, Pray to St. Jude, patron saint of desperate cases.
St. Jude, patron of desperate cases, help me. I'm desperate. She grunts and pushes and the infant's head appears, only the head, my mother, and it's the stroke of midnight, the New Year. Limerick City erupts with whistles, horns, sirens, brass bands, people calling and singing, Happy New Year. Should auld acquaintance be forgot, and church bells all over ring out the Angelus and Nurse O'Halloran weeps for the waste of a dress, that child still in there and me in me finery. Will you come out, child, will you? Grandma gives a great push and the child is in the world, a lovely girl with black curly hair and sad blue eyes.
Ah, Lord above, says Nurse O'Halloran, this child is a time straddler, born with her head in the New Year and her arse in the Old or was it her head in the Old Year and her arse in the New. You'll have to write to the Pope, missus, to find out what year this child was born in and I'll save this dress for next year.
And the child was named Angela for the Angelus which rang the midnight hour, the New Year, the minute of her coming and because she was a little angel anyway.
Love her as in childhood
Though feeble, old and grey.
For you'll never miss a mother's love
Till she's buried beneath the clay.
At the St. Vincent de Paul School, Angela learned to read, write, and calculate and by her ninth year her schooling was done. She tried her hand at being a charwoman, a skivvy, a maid with a little white hat opening doors, but she could not manage the little curtsy that is required and her mother said, You don't have the knack of it. You're pure useless. Why don't you go to America where there's room for all sorts of uselessness? I'll give you the fare.
She arrived in New York just in time for the first Thanksgiving Day of the Great Depression. She met Malachy at a party given by Dan MacAdorey and his wife, Minnie, on Classon Avenue in Brooklyn. Malachy liked Angela and she liked him. He had a hangdog look, which came from the three months he had just spent in jail for hijacking a truck. He and his friend John McErlaine believed what they were told in the speakeasy, that the truck was packed to the roof with cases of canned pork and beans. Neither knew how to drive and when the police saw the truck lurch and jerk along Myrtle Avenue they pulled it over. The police searched the truck and wondered why anyone would hijack a truck containing, not pork and beans, but cases of buttons.
With Angela drawn to the hangdog look and Malachy lonely after three months in jail, there was bound to be a knee-trembler.
A knee-trembler is the act itself done up against a wall, man and woman up on their toes, straining so hard their knees tremble with the excitement that's in it.
That knee-trembler put Angela in an interesting condition and, of course, there was talk. Angela had cousins, the MacNamara sisters, Delia and Philomena, married, respectively, to Jimmy Fortune of County Mayo, and Tommy Flynn, of Brooklyn itself.
Delia and Philomena were large women, great-breasted and fierce. When they sailed along the sidewalks of Brooklyn lesser creatures stepped aside, respect was shown. The sisters knew what was right and they knew what was wrong and any doubts could be resolved by the One, Holy, Roman, Catholic and Apostolic Church. They knew that Angela, unmarried, had no right to be in an interesting condition and they would take steps.
Steps they took. With Jimmy and Tommy in tow they marched to the speakeasy on Atlantic Avenue where Malachy could be found on Friday, payday when he had a job. The man in the speak, Joey Cacciamani, did not want to admit the sisters but Philomena told him that if he wanted to keep the nose on his face and that door on its hinges he'd better open up for they were there on God's business. Joey said, Awright, awright, you Irish. Jeezoz! Trouble, trouble.
Malachy, at the far end of the bar, turned pale, gave the great breasted ones a sickly smile, offered them a drink. They resisted the smile and spurned the offer. Delia said, We don't know what class of a tribe you come from in the North of Ireland.
Philomena said, There is a suspicion you might have Presbyterians in your family, which would explain what you did to our cousin.
Jimmy said, Ah, now, ah, now. 'Tisn't his fault if there's Presbyterians in his family.
Delia said, You shuddup.
Tommy had to join in. What you did to that poor unfortunate girl is a disgrace to the Irish race and you should be ashamed of yourself.
Och, I am, said Malachy. I am.
Nobody asked you to talk, said Philomena. You done enough damage with your blather, so shut your yap.
And while your yap is shut, said Delia, we're here to see you do the right thing by our poor cousin, Angela Sheehan.
Malachy said, Och, indeed, indeed. The right thing is the right thing and I'd be glad to buy you all a drink while we have this little
talk.
Take the drink, said Tommy, and shove it up your ass.
Philomena said, Our little cousin no sooner gets off the boat than
you are at her. We have morals in Limerick, you know, morals. We're not like jackrabbits from Antrim, a place crawling with Presbyterians.
Jimmy said, He don't look like a Presbyterian.
You shuddup, said Delia.
Another thing we noticed, said Philomena. You have a very odd
manner.
Malachy smiled. I do?
about
You do, says Delia. I think 'tis one of the first things we noticed you, that odd manner, and it gives us a very uneasy feeling.
'Tis that sneaky little Presbyterian smile, said Philomena.
Och, said Malachy, it's just the trouble I have with my teeth. Teeth or no teeth, odd manner or no odd manner, you're gonna marry
that girl, said Tommy. Up the middle aisle you're going.
Och, said Malachy, I wasn't planning to get married, you know.
There's no work and I wouldn't be able to support... Married is what you're going to be, said Delia. Up the middle aisle, said Jimmy.
You shuddup, said Delia.
Malachy watched them leave. I'm in a desperate pickle, he told Joey Cacciamani.
Bet your ass, said Joey. I see them babes comin' at me I jump inna Hudson River.
Malachy considered the pickle he was in. He had a few dollars in his pocket from the last job and he had an uncle in San Francisco or one of the other California Sans. Wouldn't he be better off in California, far from the great breasted MacNamara sisters and their grim husbands? He would, indeed, and he'd have a drop of the Irish to celebrate his decision and departure. Joey poured and the drink nearly took the lining off Malachy's gullet. Irish, indeed! He told Joey it was a Prohibition concoction from the devil's own still. Joey shrugged. I don't know nothing. I only pour. Still, it was better than nothing and Malachy would have another and one for yourself, Joey, and ask them two decent Italians what they'd like and what are you talking about, of course, I have the money to pay for it.
He awoke on a bench in the Long Island Railroad Station, a cop rapping on his boots with a nightstick, his escape money gone, the MacNamara sisters ready to eat him alive in Brooklyn.
On the feast of St. Joseph, a bitter day in March, four months after the knee-trembler, Malachy married Angela and in August the child was born. In November Malachy got drunk and decided it was time to register the child's birth. He thought he might name the child Malachy, after himself, but his North of Ireland accent and the alcoholic mumble confused the clerk so much he simply entered the name Male on the certificate.
Not until late December did they take Male to St. Paul's Church to be baptized and named Francis after his father's father and the lovely saint of Assisi. Angela wanted to give him a middle name, Munchin, after the patron saint of Limerick but Malachy said over his dead body. No son of his would have a Limerick name. It's hard enough going through life with one name. Sticking on middle names was an atrocious American habit and there was no need for a second name when you're christened after the man from Assisi.
There was a delay the day of the baptism when the chosen godfather, John McErlaine, got drunk at the speakeasy and forgot his responsibilities. Philomena told her husband, Tommy, he'd have to be godfather. Child's soul is in danger, she said. Tommy put his head down and grumbled. All right. I'll be godfather but I'm not goin' to be responsible if he grows up like his father causin' trouble and goin' through life with the odd manner for if he does he can go to John McErlaine at the speakeasy. The priest said, True for you, Tom, decent man that you are, fine man that never set foot inside a speakeasy. Malachy, fresh from the speakeasy himself, felt insulted and wanted to argue with the priest, one sacrilege on top of another. Take off that collar and we'll see who's the man. He had to be held back by the great breasted ones and their husbands grim. Angela, new mother, agitated, forgot she was holding the child and let him slip into the baptismal font, a total immersion of the Protestant type. The altar boy assisting the priest plucked the infant from the font and restored him to Angela, who sobbed and clutched him, dripping, to her bosom. The priest laughed, said he had never seen the likes, that the child was a regular little Baptist now and hardly needed a priest. This maddened Malachy again and he wanted to jump at the priest for calling the child some class of a Protestant. The priest said, Quiet, man, you're in God's house, and when Malachy said, God's house, my arse, he was thrown out on Court Street because you can't say arse in God's house.
After baptism Philomena said she had tea and ham and cakes in her house around the corner. Malachy said, Tea? and she said, Yes, tea, or is it whiskey you want? He said tea was grand but first he'd have to go and deal with John McErlaine, who didn't have the decency to carry out his duties as godfather. Angela said, You're only looking for an excuse to run to the speakeasy, and he said, As God is my witness, the drink is the last thing on my mind. Angela started to cry. Your son's christening day and you have to go drinking. Delia told him he was a disgusting specimen but what could you expect from the North of Ireland.
Malachy looked from one to the other, shifted on his feet, pulled his cap down over his eyes, shoved his hands deep in his trouser pockets, said, Och, aye, the way they do in the far reaches of County Antrim, turned, hurried up Court Street to the speakeasy on Atlantic Avenue where he was sure they'd ply him with free drink in honor of his son's baptism.
At Philomena's house the sisters and their husbands ate and drank while Angela sat in a corner nursing the baby and crying. Philomena stuffed her mouth with bread and ham and rumbled at Angela, That's what you get for being such a fool. Hardly off the boat and you fall for that lunatic. You shoulda stayed single, put the child up for adoption, and you'd be a free woman today. Angela cried harder and Delia took up the attack, Oh, stop it, Angela, stop it. You have nobody to blame but yourself for gettin' into trouble with a drunkard from the North, a man that doesn't even look like a Catholic, him with his odd manner. I'd say
that... that... Malachy has a streak of the Presbyterian in him right enough. You shuddup, Jimmy.
If I was you, said Philomena, I'd make sure there's no more children. He don't have a job, so he don't, an' never will the way he drinks. So... no more children, Angela. Are you listenin' to me?
I am, Philomena.
A year later another child was born. Angela called him Malachy after his father and gave him a middle name, Gerard, after his father's brother.
The MacNamara sisters said Angela was nothing but a rabbit and they wanted nothing to do with her till she came to her senses.
Their husbands agreed.
I'm in a playground on Classon Avenue in Brooklyn with my brother, Malachy. He's two, I'm three. We're on the seesaw.
Up, down, up, down.
Malachy goes up.
I get off.
Malachy goes down. Seesaw hits the ground. He screams. His hand is
on his mouth and there's blood.
Oh, God. Blood is bad. My mother will kill me.
And here she is, trying to run across the playground. Her big belly
slows her.
She says, What did you do? What did you do to I don't know what to say. I don't know what I She pulls my ear. Go home. Go to bed. Bed?
In the middle of the day?
She pushes me toward the playground gate. Go. She picks up Malachy and waddles off.
My father's friend, Mr. MacAdorey, is outside
the child?
did.
our building. He's standing at the edge of the sidewalk with his wife, Minnie, looking at a
dog lying in the gutter. There is blood all around the dog's head. It's the color of the blood from Malachy's mouth.
Malachy has dog blood and the dog has Malachy blood.
I pull Mr. MacAdorey's hand. I tell him Malachy has blood like the
dog.
Oh, he does, indeed, Francis. Cats have it, too. And Eskimos. All
the same blood.
Minnie says, Stop that, Dan. Stop confusing the wee fellow. She
tells me the poor wee dog was hit by a car and he crawled all the way from the middle of the street before he died. Wanted to come home, the poor wee creature.
Mr. MacAdorey says, You'd better go home, Francis. I don't know what you did to your wee brother, but your mother took him off to the hospital. Go home, child.
Will Malachy die like the dog, Mr. MacAdorey? Minnie says, He bit his tongue. He won't die. Why did the dog die?
It was his time, Francis.
The apartment is empty and I wander between the two rooms, the bedroom and the kitchen. My father is out looking for a job and my mother is at the hospital with Malachy. I wish I had something to eat but there's nothing in the icebox but cabbage leaves floating in the melted ice. My father said never eat anything floating in water for the rot that might be in it. I fall asleep on my parents' bed and when my mother
shakes me it's nearly dark. Your little brother is going to sleep a while. Nearly bit his tongue off. Stitches galore. Go into the other
room.
My father is in the kitchen sipping black tea from his big white
enamel mug. He lifts me to his lap.
Dad, will you tell me the story about Coo Coo?
Cuchulain. Say it after me, Coo-hoo-lin. I'll tell you the story
when you say the name right. Coo-hoo-lin.
I say it right and he tells me the story of Cuchulain, who had a
different name when he was a boy, Setanta. He grew up in Ireland where Dad lived when he was a boy in County Antrim. Setanta had a stick and ball and one day he hit the ball and it went into the mouth of a big dog that belonged to Culain and choked him. Oh, Culain was angry and he said, What am I to do now without my big dog to guard my house and my wife and my ten small children as well as numerous pigs, hens, sheep?
Setanta said, I'm sorry. I'll guard your house with my stick and ball and I'll change my name to Cuchulain, the Hound of Culain. He did. He guarded the house and regions beyond and became a great hero, the Hound of Ulster itself. Dad said he was a greater hero than Hercules or Achilles that the Greeks were always bragging about and he could take on King Arthur and all his knights in a fair fight which, of course, you could never get with an Englishman anyway.
That's my story. Dad can't tell that story to Malachy or any other children down the hall.
He finishes the story and lets me sip his tea. It's bitter, but I'm happy there on his lap.
For days Malachy's tongue is swollen and he can hardly make a sound never mind talk. But even if he could no one is paying any attention to him because we have two new babies who were brought by an angel in the middle of the night. The neighbors say, Ooh, Ah, they're lovely boys, look at those big eyes.
Malachy stands in the middle of the room, looking up at everyone, pointing to his tongue and saying, Uck, uck. When the neighbors say, Can't you see we're looking at your little brothers? he cries, till Dad pats him on the head. Put in your tongue, son, and go out and play with Frankie. Go on.
In the playground I tell Malachy about the dog who died in the street because someone drove a ball into his mouth. Malachy shakes his head. No uck ball. Car uck kill dog. He cries because his tongue hurts and he can hardly talk and it's terrible when you can't talk. He won't let me push him on the swing. He says, You uck kill me uck on seesaw. He gets Freddie Leibowitz to push him and he's happy, laughing when he swings to the sky. Freddie is big, he's seven, and I ask him to push me. He says, No, you tried to kill your brother.
I try to get the swing going myself but all I can do is move it back and forth and I'm angry because Freddie and Malachy are laughing at the way I can't swing. They're great pals now, Freddie, seven, Malachy, two. They laugh every day and Malachy's tongue gets better with all the laughing.
When he laughs you can see how white and small and pretty his teeth are and you can see his eyes shine. He has blue eyes like my mother. He has golden hair and pink cheeks. I have brown eyes like Dad. I have black hair and my cheeks are white in the mirror. My mother tells Mrs. Leibowitz down the hall that Malachy is the happiest child in the world.
She tells Mrs. Leibowitz down the hall, Frankie has the odd manner like his father. I wonder what the odd manner is but I can't ask because I'm not supposed to be listening.
I wish I could swing up into the sky, up into the clouds. I might be able to fly around the whole world and not hear my brothers, Oliver and Eugene, cry in the middle of the night anymore. My mother says they're always hungry. She cries in the middle of the night, too. She says she's worn out nursing and feeding and changing and four boys is too much for her. She wishes she had one little girl all for herself. She'd give anything for one little girl.
I'm in the playground with Malachy. I'm four, he's three. He lets me push him on the swing because he's no good at swinging himself and Freddie Leibowitz is in school. We have to stay in the playground because the twins are sleeping and my mother says she's worn out. Go out and play, she says, and give me some rest. Dad is out looking for a job again and sometimes he comes home with the smell of whiskey, singing all the songs about suffering Ireland. Mam gets angry and says Ireland can kiss her arse. He says that's nice language to be using in front of the children and she says never mind the language, food on the table is what she wants, not suffering Ireland. She says it was a sad day Prohibition ended because Dad gets the drink going around to saloons offering to sweep out the bars and lift barrels for a whiskey or a beer. Sometimes he brings home bits of the free lunch, rye bread, corned beef, pickles. He puts the food on the table and drinks tea himself. He says food is a shock to the system and he doesn't know where we get our appetites. Mam
says,
They get their appetites because they're starving half the time.
When Dad gets a job Mam is cheerful and she sings, Anyone can see why I wanted your kiss,
It had to be and the reason is this
Could it be true, someone like you
Could love me, love me?
When Dad brings home the first week's wages Mam is delighted she can pay the lovely Italian man in the grocery shop and she can hold her head up again because there's nothing worse in the world than to owe and be beholden to anyone. She cleans the kitchen, washes the mugs and plates, brushes crumbs and bits of food from the table, cleans out the icebox and orders a fresh block of ice from another Italian. She buys toilet paper that we can take down the hall to the lavatory and that, she says, is better than having the headlines from the Daily News blackening your arse. She boils water on the stove and spends a day at a great tin tub washing our shirts and socks, diapers for the twins, our two sheets, our three towels. She hangs everything out on the clotheslines behind the apartment house and we can watch the clothes dance in wind and sun. She says you wouldn't want the neighbors to know what you have in the way of a wash but there's nothing like the sweetness of clothes dried by the sun.
When Dad brings home the first week's wages on a Friday night we know the weekend will be wonderful. On Saturday night Mam will boil water on the stove and wash us in the great tin tub and Dad will dry us. Malachy will turn around and show his behind. Dad will pretend to be shocked and we'll all laugh. Mam will make hot cocoa and we'll be able to stay up while Dad tells us a story out of his head. All we have to do is
say a name, Mr. MacAdorey or Mr. Leibowitz down the hall, and Dad will have the two of them rowing up a river in Brazil chased by Indians with green noses and puce shoulders. On nights like that we can drift off to sleep knowing there will be a breakfast of eggs, fried tomatoes and fried bread, tea with lashings of sugar and milk and, later in the day, a big dinner of mashed potatoes, peas and ham, and a trifle Mam makes, layers of fruit and warm delicious custard on a cake soaked in sherry.
When Dad brings home the first week's wages and the weather is fine Mam takes us to the playground. She sits on a bench and talks to Minnie MacAdorey. She tells Minnie stories about characters in Limerick and Minnie tells her about characters in Belfast and they laugh because there are funny people in Ireland, North and South. Then they teach each other sad songs and Malachy and I leave the swings and see-saws to sit with them on the bench and sing, A group of young soldiers one night in a camp Were talking of sweethearts they had.
All seemed so merry except one young lad, And he was downhearted and sad.
Come and join us, said one of the boys, Surely there's someone for you.
But Ned shook his head and proudly he said I am in love with two, Each like a mother to me,
From neither of them shall I part.
For one is my mother,
God bless her and love her,
The other is my sweetheart.
Malachy and I sing that song and Mam and Minnie laugh till they cry at the way Malachy takes a deep bow and holds his arms out to Mam at the end. Dan MacAdorey comes along on his way home from work and says Rudy Vallee better start worrying about the competition.
When we go home Mam makes tea and bread and jam or mashed potatoes with butter and salt. Dad drinks the tea and eats nothing. Mam says, God above, How can you work all day and not eat? He says, The tea is enough. She says, You'll ruin your health, and he tells her again that food is a shock to the system. He drinks his tea and tells us stories and shows us letters and words in the Daily News or he smokes a cigarette, stares at the wall, runs his tongue over his lips.
When Dad's job goes into the third week he does not bring home the wages. On Friday night we wait for him and Mam gives us bread and tea. The darkness comes down and the lights come on along Classon Avenue. Other men with jobs are home already and having eggs for dinner because you can't have meat on a Friday. You can hear the families talking upstairs and downstairs and down the hall and Bing Crosby is singing on the radio, Brother, can you spare a dime?
Malachy and I play with the twins. We know Mam won't sing Anyone can see why I wanted your kiss. She sits at the kitchen table talking to herself, What am I going to do? till it's late and Dad rolls up the stairs singing Roddy McCorley. He pushes in the door and calls for us, Where are my troops? Where are my four warriors?
Mam says, Leave those boys alone. They're gone to bed half hungry because you have to fill your belly with whiskey.
He comes to the bedroom door. Up, boys, up. A nickel for everyone who promises to die for Ireland.
Deep in Canadian woods we met
From one bright island flown.
Great is the land we tread, but yet
Our hearts are with our own.
Up, boys, up. Francis, Malachy, Oliver, Eugene. The Red Branch Knights, the Fenian Men, the IRA. Up, up.
Mam is at the kitchen table, shaking, her hair hanging damp, her face wet. Can't you leave them alone? she says. Jesus, Mary and Joseph,
isn't it enough that you come home without making fools of the children on top of it? She comes to us. Go back to bed, she
I want them up, he says. I want them
be free from the center to the sea.
Don't cross me, she says, for if you your mother's house.
a penny in your pocket without
says.
ready for the day Ireland will
do it'll be a sorry day in
He pulls his cap down over his face and cries, My poor mother. Poor Ireland. Och, what are we going to do?
Mam says, You're pure stone mad, and she tells us again to go to bed.
On the morning of the fourth Friday of Dad's job Mam asks him if he'll be home tonight with his wages or will he drink everything again? He looks at us and shakes his head at Mam as if to say, Och, you shouldn't talk like that in front of the children.
Mam keeps at him. I'm asking you, Are you coming home so that we can have a bit of supper or will it be midnight with no money in your pocket and you singing Kevin Barry and the rest of the sad songs?
He puts on his cap, shoves his hands into his trouser pockets, sighs and looks up at the ceiling. I told you before I'll be home, he
says.
Later in the day Mam dresses us. She puts the twins into the pram
and off we go through the long streets of Brooklyn. Sometimes she lets Malachy sit in the pram when he's tired of tro",en,LABEL_0,0.5079416632652283,LABEL_1,0.49205833673477173

Cinnabons are being cut up and cooked by Cinnabon workers. Close up on a sign reading Omaha. The customers are handed their Cinnabons, then we cut to the manager of the place, Gene. The camera pans up to his balding head, then down to reveal this is Saul Goodman with a moustache and thick spectacles. He performs various tasks around the kitchen, then looks up over the counter to see a burly man staring him down. The man walks to the counter, gets a good look at Saul, and then walks out to meet a group of friends.
EXT. SAUL GOODMAN‚ÄôS APARTMENT - BLACK AND WHITE
Snow falls outside the apartment as a plow drives by
INT. SAUL GOODMAN‚ÄôS APARTMENT - BLACK AND WHITE
Saul puts two ice cubes in a glass then fills it with a concoction of alcohol. He sits down on the couch and watches TV. He flips between channels, the weatherman tells him Omaha‚Äôs going to get hit with snow which causes him to go to his window and check on the snow. He goes into his cabinet and grabs a box filled with Polaroid photos and a passport and grabs a tape that he puts into the VCR.
TV SAUL (O.S.): Don‚Äôt let false accusations bully you into an unfair fight! I‚Äôm Saul Goodman and I‚Äôll do the fighting for you! No charge is too big for me. When legal forces have you cornered, better call Saul!
Close up on modern day Saul looking miserable.
TV SAUL (O.S.): I‚Äôll get your case dismissed! I‚Äôll give you the defense you deserve! Why? Because I‚Äôm Saul Goodman, attorney at law. I investigate, advocate, persuade, and most importantly, win! Better call Saul!
Camera slowly zooms in on modern day Saul holding back tears.
TV SAUL (O.S.): Do you feel doomed? Have opponents of freedom wrongly intimidated you? Maybe they told you that you‚Äôre in serious trouble and there‚Äôs nothing you can do about it. I‚Äôm Saul Goodman, and I‚Äôm here to tell you that they‚Äôre wrong! It‚Äôs never too late for justice. Better call‚Ä¶
END COLD OPEN
INT. NEW MEXICO COURTROOM
Close up on the judge. Shots around the courtroom. Three defendants sit next to an empty chair. The prosecutor doodles a man wielding a sword on horseback in his notebook. The judge looks at his watch then gives the security guard a look. The guard gets up and walks out of the courtroom.
INT. COURTROOM BATHROOM
Close up of the urinals with the shadow of a man on the wall.
SAUL (O.S.): Think about it. Their brain...it‚Äôs not all there yet. Now if we were all held responsible for what we did when we were 19‚Ä¶ (laughs). I remember what it was like being a kid. Think back to when you were 19. (more nervous laughter and hand motions) So judge, what do you say?
Security guard opens door and sees Saul talking to the urinal.
SAUL: These boys are 19. These three young men‚Ä¶
SECURITY GUARD: Psst.
INT. COURTROOM
Saul bursts through the door full of energy.
SAUL: Oh to be 19 again! You with me ladies and gentleman, do you remember 19? Let me tell ya, the juices are flowing, the red corpuscles are corpuscle-ing, the grass is green and soft, and summer‚Äôs gonna last forever. Now do you remember? Yeah you do.
Saul points at a middle-aged lady in the jury.
SAUL: But if you‚Äôre being honest, I mean, really honest, you‚Äôll recall that you also had an underdeveloped 19 year old brain. Me personally, if I were held accountable for some of the stupid decisions I made when I was 19, oh boy, wow. And I bet if I were in church right now I‚Äôd get a big amen!
Silence
SAUL: Which brings us to these three. Now these three knuckleheads, and I‚Äôm sorry boys but that‚Äôs what you are, they did a dumb thing. I‚Äôm not denying that. However I would like you to remember two salient facts. Fact 1: nobody got hurt! Not a soul! Very important to keep that in mind. Fact 2: now the prosecution keeps dangling this term ‚Äúcriminal trespass‚Äù. Mr. Spinazo, property owner, admitted to us that he keeps most portions of his business open to the public - both day and night. So trespassing? Bit of a reach, don‚Äôt you think Dave?
Close up on the prosecutor not looking amused.
SAUL: Here‚Äôs what I know. These three young men, near honor students, were feeling their oats one Saturday night and they just went a little bananas. I don‚Äôt know, call me crazy, but I don‚Äôt think they deserve to have their bright futures ruined by a momentary, minute (points at the three boys) never to be repeated, lapse of judgement. Ladies and gentleman...you‚Äôre bigger than that.
Saul takes his seat next to the three boys who seem impressed with his defense. The prosecutor gets up without saying a word and puts a tape into the VCR on the courtroom‚Äôs TV. The screen shows the three boys cutting the head off of a dead body being used for a biology class as they brag about it and laugh into the camera. Members of the court begin walking out.
BOY 1: Stick your wang in the throat hole!
BOY 2: I will if you will, loser!
EXT. COURTROOM
Close-up on a check written out to James M. McGill for $700
SAUL: What the hell kind of math is that?
LADY: $700 per defense.
SAUL: No no no. Defen‚Äîdant. Dant. 3 defendants, $2,100. Which, by the way, a bargain for what I did for them.
LADY: They going to jail, ain‚Äôt they?
SAUL: So, since when does that matter? They had sex with a head!
LADY: Didn‚Äôt somebody tell you not to try all three of them together? 1 trial, $700!
SAUL: You‚Äôre gonna miss me, you are gonna miss me, cause it‚Äôll be a cold day in hell before I do any PD work for this shitty court! Sayonara, baby!
LADY: You have yourself a nice day.
EXT. PARKING LOT
Saul storms by a white Cadillac to get into a beaten-down yellow Suzuki Esteem with one red door. His phone rings.
SAUL (speaking as an Irish woman): Law offices of James McGill, how may I direct your call?...Yes, Mrs. Kettleman, so good of you to return!...Actually I don‚Äôt have Mr. McGill at the moment, but I know he...Oh, splendid. Unfortunately our office is being painted, and the fumes are quite horrid, could he meet you and your husband at, say, Loyola‚Äôs caf√© at Central?...4 o‚Äôclock it shall be, cheers!
Saul checks his watch, gets into the car, then starts his car and sputters away. He hands his ticket to the man working the toll booth.
MIKE: Three dollars.
SAUL: Uh, I‚Äôm validated, see the stickers.
MIKE: Well, I see five stickers, you‚Äôre one shy. Three dollars.
SAUL: They gave me, look, I‚Äôm validated for the entire day, ok? Five stickers, six stickers, I don‚Äôt know stickers because I was in that court back there, saving people‚Äôs lives, so‚Ä¶
MIKE: Well, gee, that‚Äôs swell. And thank you for restoring my faith in the judicial system. Now you either pay the three dollars, or you go back inside and get an additional sticker.
Mike hands the ticket back.
SAUL: Son of a bitch‚Ä¶ Fine! You win! Hooray for you! (to car behind him) Backing up, I‚Äôm backing up, I need more stickers! I don‚Äôt have enough stickers! Thank you, thank you, very nice! Employee of the month over here! (claps) Hooray, give him a medal! (to cops) don‚Äôt do anything guys, just relax.
INT. LOYOLA‚ÄôS CAF√â
BETSY KETTLEMAN: Well, I‚Äôm just fuzzy as to why you think he needs a lawyer. I mean, Craig, the way you run your office is beyond reproach.
CRAIG KETTLEMAN: Beyond reproach. I‚Äôm a stickler.
BETSY: Yes, he‚Äôs a stickler with the money, he‚Äôs definitely a stickler. I mean he‚Äôs certainly not guilty of some‚Ä¶
SAUL: Certainly not. He‚Äôs innocent of any wrongdoing. It‚Äôs abundantly clear to me, and frankly, I don‚Äôt go looking for guilty people to represent. I mean, who needs that aggravation, right?
Mr. and Mrs. Kettleman chuckle.
SAUL: Look, all I know is what I read in the paper. Typically, when money goes missing from accounting treasury, and the number is, uh, $1.6 million‚Ä¶
BETSY: Well that‚Äôs an accounting...discrepancy.
SAUL: Discrepancy, absolutely. But typically, when that happens, the police look at the treasurer. And since that person is, uh (gestures at Craig). I just think a little proactivity may be in order here.
CRAIG: I just think I‚Äôd look guilty if I hired a lawyer.
SAUL: Actually, it‚Äôs getting arrested that makes people look guilty, even the innocent ones. And innocent people get arrested everyday. And they find themselves in a little room with a detective who acts like he‚Äôs their best friend. ‚ÄúTalk to me‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúHelp me clear this up‚Äù. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need a lawyer, only guilty people need lawyers‚Äù, and BOOM! That‚Äôs when it all goes south. That‚Äôs when you want someone in your corner, someone who will fight tooth and nail. Lawyers. We‚Äôre like health insurance. You hope you never need it, but man, oh, man, not having it? No!
CRAIG: How would we proceed if we decided to um‚Ä¶
SAUL: Well this is a letter of engagement. It‚Äôs very simple. Straightforward. Please read it closely, but, uh, if you sign it I can get started on that defense strategy of ours this very afternoon.
Close up of Craig‚Äôs hand hovering with the pen above the contract. He looks ready to sign before his wife takes his hand
BETSY: Craig, I think maybe we should sleep on it.
CRAIG: Uh, sure. Don‚Äôt you think, Mr. McGill?
SAUL: Oh please, call me Jimmy. Absolutely, I mean there‚Äôs no rush.
CRAIG: Oh, and you know, Craig, we gotta pick up the kids.
BETSY: At the‚Ä¶
CRAIG: Oh...right. Well we will be in touch. Thank you for the coffee and for the advice.
They shake hands.
SAUL: You‚Äôre very welcome. Here, take this, it‚Äôs got my phone number on it.
Saul hands Craig a personalized matchbook.
BETSY: Ok.
INT. SAUL‚ÄôS CAR
SAUL (on the phone): The number is 9456-0054-4896-0643. And the expiration is 11/04. OK, and the key word here is classy, alright? Shoot for classy. Use only flowers that look expensive. But, you know, aren‚Äôt. And the note should say ‚ÄúDear Betsy and Craig, best wishes from your stickler for justice. -James McGill‚Äù. OK, and McGill‚Äôs spelt M-C‚Ä¶ Well run it again. Well no, no, no, it‚Äôs paid up, run it again.
A skater goes crashing into Saul‚Äôs car breaking the windshield. Saul pulls over and hyperventilates.
LARS: Oh god, oh god, Cal! Look at me, look at me! (to Saul) what did you do?!
SAUL: I didn‚Äôt do anything‚Ä¶
LARS: What did you do to my brother?! Look where you‚Äôre going!
SAUL: I was making a turn, he came out of nowhere!
LARS: You freaking hit him man! You ran him over! You ran over my brother! I got the whole thing on video!
CAL: It was an accident, it was an accident. He didn‚Äôt mean to.
He tries to get up and screams, grabbing his leg.
LARS: It‚Äôs broken! You broke his leg! You‚Äôre driving around and not looking? Breaking people‚Äôs legs? Somebody call the cops!
SAUL: Don‚Äôt call the police, don‚Äôt call the police!
Cut to landscapers looking on from the distance.
LARS: Polic√≠a! I‚Äôm doing it myself!
Starts dialing.
SAUL (desperate): Don‚Äôt call the police, don‚Äôt call the police!
LARS: Don‚Äôt call the cops?
SAUL: No!
LARS: How are you gonna fix this? What are you gonna do to make things right?
SAUL: I don‚Äôt know, fellas. What can I do to make it right?
The two skaters exchange a look.
CAL: I don‚Äôt know. $500?
SAUL: 500 bucks?
Saul starts kicking the skater he hit.
CAL: Ow, what the hell man?!
SAUL: Listen, Starlight Express, I‚Äôm gonna give you a 9.6 for technique, 0.0 for choice of victim! I‚Äôm a lawyer! Furthermore (points at his car) does this steaming pile of crap scream payday to you, huh? The only way that entire car is worth $500 is if there‚Äôs a $300 hooker sitting in it! Now let‚Äôs talk about what you owe me for the windshield.
The two skaters look at each other then run away.
SAUL: I‚Äôll take a check!
INT. NAIL SALON
SAUL: Chao chi c‚Äôung ladies, Chao chi c‚Äôung. Chao chi c‚Äôung Mrs. Nguynen, you look‚Ä¶ My mail?
NAIL SALON OWNER: You work for people who have sex with chopped off head?
SAUL: Was it in the paper?
OWNER: I heard it from my cousin. Why? Why you work for these people?
SAUL: Just lucky, I guess.
Saul grabs a cup and goes to fill it up.
OWNER: Cucumber water for customer only.
Saul puts the cup down and head to the back room. Next to the washing machine is a door with a taped on sign reading ‚ÄúJames M. McGill Esq. A Law Corporation""
INT. SAUL‚ÄôS OFFICE
Saul‚Äôs desk is right next to the hot water heater. There‚Äôs only enough room for his desk and one folding chair. He checks his phone and finds that he has no new messages. He sifts through his mail - all bills except for an envelope from Hamlin Hamlin & McGill with a check for $26,000 enclosed. Saul rips it into pieces
INT. LAW OFFICES OF HAMLIN HAMLIN McGILL
Saul is waiting for an elevator. Camera cuts to a dented trash can. Saul goes up the elevator and heads to the secretary‚Äôs desk
SAUL: Brenda, looking good. Nice ‚Äòdo. Uh, where‚Äôs Lord Vader?
BRENDA: He‚Äôs not quite ready for you yet.
SAUL: South conference room.
BRENDA: How about you wait out here?
SAUL: How about I don‚Äôt!
Sees another lawyer as he heads towards the conference room.
SAUL: Sir Francis!
FRANCIS: James.
SAUL: Well groomed as always.
FRANCIS: Ok.
Saul heads up the stairs passing former co-workers as he goes.
SAUL: Keith, Karen, yes!
INT. SOUTH CONFERENCE ROOM
SAUL: YOU HAVE MEDDLED WITH THE PRIMAL FORCES OF NATURE, MR. HAMLIN, AND I WON‚ÄôT HAVE IT!
BRENDA (over speakerphone): Do you want me to call security?
KIM WEXLER: It‚Äôs ok, Brenda, we got it.
SAUL (O.S.) Hey Jack, hey Nate, hey Erin.
HOWARD HAMLIN: What can we do for you, Jimmy?
SAUL: I‚Äôm sorry, this table (knocks on it). Something just come over me.
Sprinkles the shredded up check onto the table.
SAUL: You can tell me what this $26,000‚Äôs supposed to be for.
HOWARD: That‚Äôs money for Chuck. Isn‚Äôt that what you wanted?
SAUL: A measly 26 grand? Jesus you‚Äôre like Peter Minuit with the Indians, throw in some beads and shells while you‚Äôre at it.
HOWARD: It‚Äôs just a start, they‚Äôll be more. Unless you‚Äôre just gonna tear them all up.
SAUL: And why was it made out to me, why not Chuck?
HOWARD: Can he make his way to the bank?
Silence
HOWARD: I just assumed it was best to have the money go through you. We can do it any way you want.
SAUL: This isn‚Äôt going away, Howard. What Chuck did for this firm, and damn near singlehandedly, one-third of this place belongs to him. What do you got 12 chairs here? 4 of these chairs are Chuck‚Äôs. You got 5 of these light thingamajigs? Uh, 1 and ‚Öî are Chuck‚Äôs! How many danishes, six danishes?
HOWARD: You can have all the danishes you want Jimmy.
SAUL: No no! They‚Äôre Chuck‚Äôs danishes! And he isn‚Äôt greedy so he‚Äôll just take two...plus $17 million dollars. In that ballpark. I mean we‚Äôll know once we get the accountants poking around here. Until then no penny ante checks trying to make it look like Chuck still works here, he doesn‚Äôt. He never will again. It‚Äôs time to do right by him and cash him out.
HOWARD: So these are Chuck‚Äôs own wishes that you‚Äôre conveying?
SAUL: This is what‚Äôs best for him.
HOWARD: So he personally told you that it‚Äôs his wish to withdraw from the firm?
Saul says nothing.
HOWARD: See, that would surprise me.
SAUL: It‚Äôs been nearly a year since he stepped foot in here. I‚Äôm just doing what‚Äôs in his best interest.
HOWARD: So am I. And I, for one, believe he‚Äôs gonna lick this thing. Until then, his office is just how he left it. His secretary‚Äôs still on payroll. If Chuck can call this an extended sabbatical then so can we! He‚Äôs that important to us.
SAUL: You know what? Let‚Äôs let a jury figure it out. They‚Äôre gonna love you, Howard. You‚Äôre so down to earth! And relatable!
Saul walks to the other head of the table.
SAUL: AND YOU WILL ATONE!
No reaction
SAUL: It‚Äôs Ned Beatty. Network. For Christ‚Äôs sakes, guys.
Saul walks out of the conference room, Howard follows him.
HOWARD: Jimmy! I almost forgot. This month‚Äôs filings. You could save me the postage.
SAUL: Weren‚Äôt you listening in there? Chuck doesn‚Äôt work here anymore. You think I‚Äôm gonna help you establish a paper trail?
HOWARD: Jimmy‚Ä¶
SAUL: No, stop trying to pawn that shit off on him.
HOWARD: Jimmy...You know, Jimmy, sometimes in our line of work you can get so caught up in the idea of winning that you forget to listen to your heart. Give Chuck my love. Would ya?
Howard starts to walk away.
HOWARD (O.S.): Oh! There ya are! Betsy! Craig!
Saul looks to the bottom of the stairs and sees the Kettlemans talking to Howard. Saul takes the elevator down then starts kicking the already dented trash can. He walks out the door and stands next to a woman against the wall who‚Äôs smoking a cigarette. Her face is hidden in the shadows.
SAUL: Couldn‚Äôt you just‚Ä¶
KIM: You know I can‚Äôt.
EXT. CHUCK‚ÄôS HOUSE
Saul pulls out front and checks Chuck‚Äôs mail for him. He puts his watch, car keys, and phone inside the mailbox.
INT. CHUCK‚ÄôS HOUSE
SAUL: Son of a bitch!
CHUCK: You ground yourself?
SAUL: Yes, I grounded myself!
Chuck lights an oil lantern. We see his house is completely devoid of electricity. He puts a grocery bag into a cooler.
INT. CHUCK‚ÄôS LIVING ROOM
Chuck is typing into a typewriter.
SAUL: You gotta stop putting bacon on the list, that cooler‚Äôs looking like a trichinosis stew.
CHUCK: Perfect timing.
He hands Saul a page from his typewriter
SAUL: Professor Brands Vogelson? University of Helsinki?
CHUCK: Yeah, you‚Äôre gonna have to get that translated.
SAUL: Into Swedish?
CHUCK: Finnish.
SAUL: Finnish translating‚Ä¶
CHUCK: I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs someone at UNM who can do that.
SAUL: You do know I‚Äôm trying to start a legal practice right?
CHUCK: Vogelson‚Äôs been working on the effects of electromagnetic fields on zebra fish, and oh!
Pulls out a newspaper
CHUCK: Financial Times!
SAUL: Yeah, I knew you missed it, so I figured, ""what the heck?""
CHUCK: I know it‚Äôs expensive so, here.
Hands him a can full of money
SAUL: That‚Äôs not‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs alright.
CHUCK: I don‚Äôt expect you to go out of pocket. Go ahead, reimburse yourself.
Saul takes money from the can
SAUL: Thanks.
Chuck starts reading the Financial Times.
SAUL: Hey, Chuck, um, can you not read that for a second? Can we talk?
Chuck puts down the paper and holds a lantern to Saul‚Äôs face.
CHUCK: Are you all right? You look peaked.
SAUL: I‚Äôm fine, please just sit.
CHUCK (sitting down): You‚Äôre not in trouble?
SAUL: Um, you gotta cash out. You gotta.
Chuck shakes his head.
CHUCK: Again, really?
SAUL: There‚Äôs no other way. I know you don‚Äôt wanna hear it, but you got to.
CHUCK: You know I‚Äôm gonna beat this. You know I‚Äôm going to get better.
SAUL (hesitant): Yeah, sure!
CHUCK: Well then there‚Äôs nothing more to talk about! I will beat this. Ergo, a falsis principiis proficisci. Meaning? (gestures to Saul)
SAUL: That‚Äôs the one about false principles, but it‚Äôs not‚Ä¶
CHUCK: You proceed from false principles. Your argument is built on quicksand, therefore it collapses.
They move from Chuck‚Äôs desk to the couch.
SAUL: You‚Äôre not listening.
CHUCK: Fine. Let‚Äôs take this to its logical conclusion. In order to pay out my share, suppose the partners are forced to liquidate the firm? Then what?
SAUL: That‚Äôs their problem.
CHUCK: My clients are out in the cold! My cases are scattered to the winds, and 126 people lose their jobs. What happens to your cronies in the mail room? The assistants, paralegals, the janitors? All of them, out on the street. Your friend Kim. A promising career over and done with.
SAUL: Hamlin owes you everything. You built that place single-handedly while he was out at four hills working on his bunker shot.
CHUCK: Let‚Äôs not exaggerate. I helped.
SAUL: You helped.
CHUCK: All the more reason not to tear it down just for a little bit of cash.
SAUL: Look Chuck, I'm going under, okay? For the third time with these bull-crap contract counsel -
CHUCK: Bull crap?
SAUL: Bull-crap, pissant P.D. cases at 700 bucks a shot.
CHUCK: Public-defender work is some of the best experience there is.
SAUL: I just had a case, Chuck, with three clients Uh, arraignments, voir dire, jury trial, the whole nine yards. You know what I took home? 700 bucks. Yeah, I might as well head down to skid row and sell plasma.
CHUCK: You're representing people who have nowhere else to turn. The money is beside the point.
SAUL: Money is not beside the point. Money is the point!
CHUCK: I keep telling you Have patience. There are no shortcuts. Do good work, and the clients will come.
SAUL: ‚ÄúThe clients will come‚Äù. Yeah, I know. OK. Hand to God, I wasn‚Äôt gonna say this, but you are broke. I can‚Äôt carry both of us, I‚Äôve been trying like hell but I can‚Äôt.
CHUCK: Well, you're saying what? You think you have to provide for me? I never asked you that.
SAUL: You didn't have to ask, okay? I've been doing my damnedest, but the day of reckoning is here. Soon, Chuck, you're gonna be out on the street with all the electromagnetism in the world raining down on you. Now, please, please, picture that, then tell me that money is beside the point.
CHUCK: This is what has you all worked up?
SAUL: Yeah!
CHUCK: Jimmy.
Chuck stands up.
CHUCK: There‚Äôs nothing to worry about. Here.
Chuck hands Saul a check.
SAUL: What is this?
CHUCK: A stipend. There's gonna be one every week.
SAUL: $857 from Hamlin Hamlin McGill.
CHUCK: I'm gonna pay them back. Every penny. I didn't want to take anything, but Howard was very insistent. And I'm gonna pay you back, too.
SAUL: Wait, Hamlin was here?
CHUCK: It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm a recluse.
SAUL: What, he put his cellphone in the mailbox?
CHUCK: He understands the situation.
SAUL: He grounded himself?
CHUCK: Of course!
SAUL: And the two of you agreed that since, as everybody knows, you're going back to work any day now, that the firm should help you make ends meet.
CHUCK: That's correct, minus the sarcasm.
SAUL: Hamlin's making you a chump!
CHUCK: I'm going to get better! I'm gonna go back to work, and I'm picking up where I left off!
(beat)
SAUL: Sorry. Sorry Chuck.
CHUCK: I understand that you're trying to look out for me, but you're missing the bigger picture.
SAUL: I got it.
CHUCK: Speaking of which Howard brought this. He's concerned.
Close up of the James M. McGill matchbook
SAUL: What?
CHUCK: You have to admit It could be confusing Hamlin, Hamlin, Mcgill? James M. McGill?
SAUL: That‚Äôs my name, I was born with it. I‚Ä¶
CHUCK: Still. How about Vanguard law? Or Gibraltar legal?
SAUL: Wait, wait. So I'm not supposed to use my name on Hamlin's say-so? What's he gonna do, sue me?
CHUCK: Nobody wants to create an adversarial situation. I'm sure Howard would gladly pay the cost of new matchbooks and so on. It's simply a matter of professional courtesy.
SAUL: Chuck, whose side are you on?
CHUCK: There are no sides. But, Jimmy. Wouldn't you rather build your own identity? Why ride on someone else's coattails?
EXT. CHUCK‚ÄôS HOUSE
Saul grabs his keys, phone, and watch from the mailbox and gets in the car
SAUL (looking at matchbook): You wanna dance, Howard? Let‚Äôs dance.
EXT. SKATING PARK
Lars is recording Cal skate
SAUL: Hey fellas. We got business.
LARS: How did you find us?
SAUL: I know, eerie right?
Cal and Lars start to walk away
SAUL: Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on. Give me thirty seconds. Could be the most profitable thirty seconds of your lives.
Cal and Lars share a look and decide to stay.
SAUL: Let me tell you about a young guy. Actually, he's about your age. He lived a long way from here in a town called Cicero, Illinois. And in Cicero, he was the man. I mean, when he strolled down the street, all the corner boys would give him the high five. All the finest babes would smile at him and hope that he would smile back. They called him ""slippin' Jimmy,"" and everybody wanted to be his friend.
LARS: ‚ÄúSlippin‚Äô Jimmy‚Äù? What the hell kind of a name is that?
SAUL: Well, I'll tell you, now Winters in Cicero are murder. You guys growing up out here in the golden west. You don't know, okay? I'm talking cold that'll freeze the snot right in your nose. I'm talking wind that'll cut through your jacket and carve you up like a Ginsu knife. In fact, most folks in Cicero were scared of winter, but not Jimmy. Jimmy waited around all summer, and when September finally rolled around and he'd feel that first cold wind come sweeping off Lake Michigan, he knew it was coming. Was it Christmas? Was it Kwanzaa? Better. It was slip 'n fall season. Soon as it was cold enough, he'd find a nice, smooth patch of ice. State Street was good. Michigan Avenue was better. He'd pick his spot, wait for it to get busy, then he'd walk out on the ice, and boom! He would biff it so hard, people would come running from five blocks away.
LARS: Yeah, but did he collect?
SAUL: ""Did he collect?"" Slippin' Jimmy had it dialed in, all right? One good fall He'd clear 6, 8 grand. That'd keep him in old Milwaukee and Maui Wowie right through labor day. Now, see, I look at you guys, I see potential. The skateboard's a nice wrinkle. That makes it a year-round gig. And clearly, you know how to take a header, right? But I got to ask you. Your best day ever, how much did you clear?
CAL & LARS: $630
SAUL (scoffing): 630 bucks. Was that for one fall?
LARS: Two.
SAUL: Two falls in one day? Even at your age that‚Äôs gotta hurt.
CAL: True that.
SAUL: Well I got a job for ya. How‚Äôs 2 grand sound?
LARS: 2 grand for one hit.
SAUL: One hit. Plus you get to learn from the best.
INT. SAUL‚ÄôS CAR
Saul is parked outside Betsy and Craig‚Äôs house.
LARS: Nice boat.
SAUL: Yeah, discreet. Like a stripper pole in a mosque. Forget the boat. Look at the car. You know what that is?
CAL: I don‚Äôt know, a station wagon?
SAUL: It's a Mercury, a 1988 Mercury sable wagon. Remember it. Burn it into your brains. You got it?
LARS: It‚Äôs a Mercury sable wagon, sure.
SAUL: Close your eyes, what color is it?
CAL & LARS: Brown.
SAUL: No, it's medium sandalwood. Keep your eyes closed. How does the license plate start?
CAL & LARS: 4.
SAUL: Give those gentleman a gold star.
EXT. STREET CORNER
SAUL: Betsy Kettleman‚Äôs her name. Every weekday between 2:25 and 2:50, she comes through here on her way to pick up her kids at Kit Carson Elementary. Now, you need a place where she's gonna slow down, am I right?
LARS: Yeah.
SAUL: Alright, well there you go. She slows down. She hangs a right. You come shooting out of there. You do what you did to me. You go ass over teakettle. You make it a blue-ribbon special. When she gets out of the car, you're sufferin' St. Sebastian, right? You're the hammer, okay? You get in her face. You scare the bejesus out of her. Give me your phone.
Lars hands him his phone
CAL: It‚Äôs kinda busy here, don‚Äôt you think?
SAUL: Well, witnesses are good. Witnesses are pressure, all right? Now, once you've got her good and rattled, then you call for an ambulance, but really, you're calling for me. I'm number one on your speed dial, right next to your weed dealer. You call me. I hotfoot it over here. I just ""happen"" to be driving by. I stop to see what the trouble is, and this is the most important part: You don't know me. We've never met. You got it?
LARS: Sure.
SAUL: OK. Now, I'm Mrs. K's white knight. We go mano a mano. You light into me, okay? Get nasty. And no touching. Leave the hair alone. But otherwise, you know, open season. Yell. Stomp. Call me a douche bag. I'm gonna play it cool, give you back some of the razzmatazz. And once she's seen the fireworks, you fold like a lawn chair. Happy ending.
LARS: When do we get our money?
SAUL: After.
LARS: After.
SAUL: After. You get paid when I get paid. I'm the rising tide that raises all dinghies. Now, pop quiz What's the car?
CAL: Mercury sable wagon.
LARS: Baby poop brown.
SAUL: OK, do you know me?
CAL & LARS: No.
SAUL: Damn straight, go with God.
INT. SAUL‚ÄôS CAR
Saul is parked outside of the Kettleman‚Äôs house.
SAUL (rehearsing to himself): Well, I'm just glad I happened to be passing by. Happy to be of help, Betsy. May I call you Betsy? Please, call me James. Oh, the kid will be fine. Don't worry. He just got his bell rung a little. I'll handle that. Oh, no. Oh, no, no. I wouldn't think of, uh, taking your money for this.
Betsy gets into her car.
SAUL: The embezzlement case? Mm, yes, I'd I'd be happy to talk it over.
Betsy backs out of the driveway.
SAUL (ducking down): Oh shit! (calls Lars) two minute warning, two minute warning!
EXT. STREET CORNER
LARS: Got it.
Lars gets the camera ready and Cal gets ready to be hit. A light brown Ford Taurus takes a turn and Cal skates in front of it.
LARS: Oh my God, Cal! Look at me, buddy! Are you ok? Say something!
No one gets out of the car.
LARS: Come on already.
CAL: What is she doing in there, making a sandwich? Where‚Äôs her sense of responsibility?
The car speeds away.
LARS: Hey! What the f-
INT. SAUL‚ÄôS CAR
SAUL (to himself): Funny to run into you, Betsy. I was just, uh, strolling the neighborhood. You were in accident. Oh it‚Äôs‚Ä¶ (checks watch) Come on.
Phone rings
SAUL: Yeah?
LARS: She took off on us?
SAUL: She what?
LARS: It was textbook, man, we were diamonds. But then she just took off.
SAUL: OK, wait, she hit and run?
LARS: That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying, she bailed and wailed.
SAUL: OK, just stay where you are, I‚Äôll come get you.
LARS: Nah, screw that man, we‚Äôre following her.
SAUL: Following her? How?
EXT. STREET - DAY
LARS: We got our ways, yo.
Camera cuts to Cal and Lars on their skateboards, holding on to the back of a truck.
SAUL (over phone): OK, new plan, new plan, you do know me, I‚Äôm your lawyer, you got that? I‚Äôll meet you at the school.
LARS: She‚Äôs way past the school. She hooked a left on Juan Tabo, and she's coming into Holiday Park.
SAUL: Okay, stay with her. When she gets where she's going, wherever that is, just don't do anything. Wait for me.
LARS: Wait for what? You haven't been right even once! Slippin' Jimmy, my ass!
SAUL: You fell into the honeypot, kid. You get it? Hit-and-run is a felony.
LARS: So what?
SAUL: ‚ÄúSo what?‚Äù So more money!
Saul hangs up and tries to start his car.
LARS (to Cal): He says we fell in the honeypot. He says more money.
CAL: So what do we need him for?
INT. SAUL‚ÄôS CAR
Saul is trying to call Lars but only getting voicemail. He hangs up and gets his car to finally start.
EXT. SALAMANCA HOUSE
The Taurus finally pulls into a driveway. The driver gets out just as Lars and Cal roll through on their skateboards. Cal fakes a leg injury and Lars carries him. The driver is an elderly Hispanic woman.
LARS: Hey! Yo! Hold up!
CAL: Yeah what is the matter with you? You hit and run?
LARS: You ran him over! You felony‚Äôd my brother!
ABUELA: Que pasa?
CAL: Habla ingles!
LARS: We call la polic√≠a!
CAL: La polic√≠a is gonna be pissed!
LARS: I see you hit him. You see that? That windshield? You did that.
ABUELA: No entiendo!
LARS: You did that and now you pay.
ABUELA: No entiendo, senor.
LARS: Make with the dinero.
ABUELA: Dinero?
LARS: S√≠, righteous dinero.
ABUELA: Dinero?
LARS: S√≠.
She waves them towards the house.
LARS: That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm talking about.
ABUELA: Mijo! Mijo!
LARS: Is that money?
Lars and Cal shuffle into the door.
INT. SAUL‚ÄôS CAR
SAUL: C‚Äômon, c‚Äômon, where are you? (sighs) Holiday Park. (rehearsing) Mrs. Kettleman, Betsy, what are you doing here? Hit and run? That‚Äôs very serious. I can mediate, I represent their parents.
EXT. SALAMANCA HOUSE
Saul parks out front, sees the cracked windshield, runs to the front door and knocks.
SAUL: Open up, officer of the court! Open up in the name of the law!
The door starts to open
SAUL: Good afternoon, this‚Ä¶
A gun is stuck in Saul‚Äôs face, a hand pulls him inside the house. TUCO SALAMANCA checks that no one was looking then closes the door.

Dr. Taylor combines academic research with a wealth of personal knowledge of the music and shares many fascinating anecdotes about the great artists of jazz. He cautions, however, that four hours is only long enough to scratch the surface. For an in depth look at jazz history, get a copy of ""Jazz Piano, A Jazz History."" Jazz an American art form and an international phenomenon! Jazz is not the result of choosing a tune, but an ideal that is created first in the mind, inspired by ones passion and willed next in playing music. Jazz music is a language, sometimes intimate, often boisterous, but always layered with experience and life. Jazz is the most significant form of musical expression in American culture and outstanding contribution to the art of music.
From obscure origins in New Orleans over a century ago, the music and the word we use for it are now familiar the world over. Like the self-motivating, energetic solos that distinguish the genre, Jazz continues to evolve and seek new levels of artistic expression. In slightly over one hundred years, this evolution has given birth to approximately two dozen distinct Jazz styles. Jazz music draws from life experience and human emotion as the inspiration of the creative force, and through this discourse is chronicled the story of its people. Jazz musicians and those that follow the genre closely, can indeed be thought of as an artistic community complete with its leaders, spokesmen, innovators, aficionados, members and fans.
Billie Holiday at the age of 18 and after gaining more experience than most adult musicians can claim, Holiday was spotted by John Hammond and cut her first record as part of a studio group led by Benny Goodman, who was then just on the verge of public prominence. In 1935 Holiday‚Äôs career got a big push when she recorded four sides that went on to become hits, including ‚ÄúWhat a Little Moonlight Can Do‚Äù and ‚ÄúMiss Brown to You.‚Äù This landed her a recording contract of her own, and then, until 1942, she recorded a number of master tracks that would ultimately become an important building block of early American jazz music. Holiday began working with Lester Young in 1936, who pegged her with her now-famous nickname of ‚ÄúLady Day.‚Äù When Holiday joined Count Basie in 1937 and then Artie Shaw in 1938, she became one of the very first black women to work with a white orchestra, an impressive accomplishment of her time. Billie Holiday was a true artist of her day and rose as a social phenomenon in the 1950s. Her soulful, unique singing voice and her ability to boldly turn any material that she confronted into her own music made her a superstar of her time. Today, Holiday is remembered for her masterpieces, creativity and vivacity, as many of Holiday‚Äôs songs are as well known today as they were decades ago. Holiday‚Äôs poignant voice is still considered to be one of the greatest jazz voices of all time.
Billie Holiday (born Eleanora Fagan) grew up in jazz talent-rich Baltimore in the 1920s. As a young teenager, Holiday served the beginning part of her so-called ‚Äúapprenticeship‚Äù by singing along with records by Bessie Smith or Louis Armstrong in after-hours jazz clubs. When Holiday‚Äôs mother, Sadie Fagan, moved to New York in search of a better job, Billie eventually went with her. She made her true singing debut in obscure Harlem nightclubs and borrowed her professional name ‚Äì Billie Holiday ‚Äì from screen star Billie Dove. Although she never underwent any technical training and never even so much as learned how to read music, Holiday quickly became an active participant in what was then one of the most vibrant jazz scenes in the country. She would move from one club to another, working for tips. She would sometimes sing with the accompaniment of a house piano player while other times she would work as part of a group of performers. In the 1930s, when Holiday was working with Columbia Records, she was first introduced to the poem ‚ÄúStrange Fruit,‚Äù an emotional piece about the lynching of a black man. Though Columbia would not allow her to record the piece due to subject matter, Holiday went on to record the song with an alternate label, Commodore, and the song eventually became one of Holiday‚Äôs classics.
It was ‚ÄúStrange Fruit‚Äù that eventually prompted Lady Day to continue more of her signature, moving ballads. Holiday recorded about 100 new recordings on another label, Verve, from 1952 to 1959. Her voice became more rugged and vulnerable on these tracks than earlier in her career. During this period, she toured Europe, and made her final studio recordings for the MGM label in March of 1959. Despite her lack of technical training, Holiday‚Äôs unique diction, inimitable phrasing and acute dramatic intensity made her the outstanding jazz singer of her day. White gardenias, worn in her hair, became her trademark. ‚ÄúSinging songs like the ‚ÄòThe Man I Love‚Äô or ‚ÄòPorgy‚Äô is no more work than sitting down and eating Chinese roast duck, and I love roast duck,‚Äù she wrote in her autobiography. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve lived songs like that.‚Äù Billie Holiday, a musical legend still popular today, died an untimely death at the age of 44. Her emotive voice, innovative techniques and touching songs will forever be remembered and enjoyed.Embed",en,LABEL_0,0.4754437506198883,LABEL_1,0.5245562195777893

Screenplay by Quentin Tarantino
When you are tired of relationships, try a romance.
INT. BAR ‚àö NIGHT
A smoky cocktail bar downtown Detroit.
CLARENCE WORLEY, a young hipster hepcat, is trying to pick up an older
lady named LUCY. She isn't bothered by him, in fact, she's alittle charmed. But,
you can tell, that she isn't going to leave her barstool.
CLARENCE
In ""Jailhouse Rock"" he's everything rockabilly's about. I mean he is
rockabilly: mean, surly, nasty, rude. In that movie he couldn't give a fuck
about anything except rockin' and rollin', livin' fast, dyin' young, and
leaving a good-looking corpse. I love that scene where after he's made it big
he's throwing a big cocktail party, and all these highbrows are there, and
he's singing, ""Baby You're So Square... Baby, I Don't Care"". Now, they got
him dressed like a dick. He's wearing these stupid-lookin' pants, this
horrible sweater. Elvis ain't no sweater boy. I even think they got him
wearin' penny loafers. Despite all that shit, all the highbrows at the party,
big house, the stupid clothes, he's still a rude-lookin' motherfucker. I'd
watch that hillbilly and I'd want to be him so bad. Elvis looked good. I'm
no fag, but Elvis was good-lookin'. He was fuckin' prettier than most
women. I always said if I ever had to fuck a guy... I mean had too cause my
life depended on it... I'd fuck Elvis.
Lucy takes a drag from her cigarette.
LUCY
I'd fuck Elvis.
CLARENCE
Really?
LUCY
When he was alive. I wouldn't fuck him now.
CLARENCE
I don't blame you.
(they laugh)
So we'd both fuck Elvis. It's nice to meet people with common interests,
isn't it?
Lucy laughs.
CLARENCE
Well, enough about the King, how 'bout you?
LUCY
How 'bout me what?
CLARENCE
How 'bout you go to the movies with me tonight?
LUCY
What are we gonna see?
CLARENCE
A Donny Chiba triple feature. ""The Streetfighter"", ""Return of the
Streetfighter"", and ""Sister Streetfighter"".
LUCY
Who's Sonny Chiba?
CLARENCE
He is, bar none, the greatest actor working in martial arts movies ever.
LUCY
(not believing this)
You wanna take me to a kung fu movie?
CLARENCE
(holding up three fingers)
Three kung fu movies.
Lucy takes a drag from her cigarette.
LUCY
(laughing)
I don't think so, not my cup of tea.
INT. DINGY HOTEL ROOM ‚àö DAY
The sounds of the city flow in through an open window: car horns, gun shots
and violence. Paint is peeling off the walls and the once green carpet is stained
black.
On the bed nearby is a huge open suitcase filled with clear plastic bags of
cocaine. Shotguns and pistols have been dropped carelessly around the
suitcase. On the far end of the room, against the wall, is a TV. ""Bewitched"" is
playing.
At the opposite end of the room, by the front, is a table. DREXL SPIVEY and
FLOYD DIXON sit around. Cocaine is on the table as well as little plastic
bags and a weigher. Floyd is black, Drexl is a white boy, though you wouldn't
know it listen to him.
DREXL
Nigger, get outta my face with that bullshit.
FLOYD
Naw man, I don't be eatin' that shit.
DREXL
That's bullshit.
BIG DON WATTS, a stout, mean-looking black man who's older than Drexl
and Floyd. Walks through the door carrying hamburgers and french fries in
two greasy brown-paper bags.
FLOYD
Naw man, that's some serious shit.
DREXL
Nigger, you lie like a big dog.
BIG D
What the fuck are you talkin' about?
DREXL
Floyd say he don't be eatin' pussy.
BIG D
Shit, any nigger say he don't eat pussy is lyin' his ass off.
DREXL
I heard that.
FLOYD
Hold on a second, Big D. You sayin' you eat pussy?
BIG D
Nigger, I eat everything. I eat pussy. I eat the butt. I eat every
motherfuckin' thang.
DREXL
Preach on, Big D.
FLOYD
Look here. If I ever did eat some pussy ‚àö I would never eat any pussy ‚àö but,
if I did eat some pussy, I sure as hell wouldn't tell no goddamn body. I'd be
ashamed as a motherfucker.
BIG D
Shit! Nigger you smoke enough sherm your dumb ass'll do a lot a crazy ass
things. So you won't eat pussy? Motherfucker, you be up there suckin'
niggers' dicks.
DREXL
Heard that.
Drexl and Big D bump fists.
FLOYD
Yeah, that's right, laugh. It's so funny, oh it's so funny.
(he takes a hit off of a joint)
There used to be a time when sisters didn't know shit about gettin' their
pussy licked. Then the sixties came an' they started fuckin' around with
white boys. And white boys are freaks for that shit ‚àö
DREXL
‚àö Because it's good!
FLOYD
Then, after a while sisters use to gettin' their little pussy eat. And because
you white boys had to make pigs out of yourselves, you fucked it up for
every nigger in the world everywhere.
BIG D
Drexl. On behalf of me and all the brothers who aren't here, I'd like to
express our gratitude ‚àö
Drexl and Big D bust up.
FLOYD
Go on pussy-eaters... laugh. You look like you be eatin' pussy. You got
pussy-eatin' mugs. Now if a nigger wants to get his dick sucked he's got to
do a bunch of fucked-up shit.
BIG D
So you do eat pussy!
FLOYD
Naw naw!
BIG D
You don't like it, but you eat that shit.
(to Drexl)
He eats it.
DREXL
Damn skippy. He like it, too.
BIG D
(mock English accent)
Me thinketh he doth protest too much.
FLOYD
Well fuck you guys then! You guys are fucked up!
DREXL
Why you trippin'? We jus' fuckin' with ya. But I wanna ask you a question.
You with some fine bitch, I mean a brick shithouse bitch ‚àö you're with
Jayne Kennedy. You're with Jayne Kennedy and you say ""Bitch, suck my
dick!"" and then Jayne Kennedy says, ""First things first, nigger, I ain't
suckin' shit till you bring your ass over here and lick my bush!"" Now, what
do you say?
FLOYD
I tell Jayne Kennedy, ""Suck my dick or I'll beat your ass!""
BIG D
Nigger, get real. You touch Jayne Kennedy she'll have you ass in Wayne
County so fast ‚àö
DREXL
Nigger, back off, you ain't beatin' shit. Now what would you do.
FLOYD
I'd say fuck it!
Drexl and Big D get up from the table disgusted and walk away, leaving Floyd
sitting all alone.
Big D sits on the bed, his back turned to Floyd, watching ""Bewitched"".
FLOYD
(yelling after them)
Ain't no man have to eat pussy!
BIG D
(not even looking)
Take that shit somewhere else.
DRXL
(marching back)
You tell Jayne Kennedy to fuck it?
FLOYD
If it came down to who eats who, damn skippy.
DREXL
With that terrible mug of yours if Jayne Kennedy told you to eat her pussy,
kiss her ass, lick her feet, chow on her shit, and suck her dog's dick, nigger,
you'd aim to please.
BIG D
(glued on TV)
I'm hip.
DREXL
In fact, I'm gonna show you what I mean with a little demonstration. Big D,
toss me that shotgun.
Without turning away from ""Bewitched"" he picks up the shotgun and tosses it to
Drexl.
DREXL
(to Floyd)
All right, check this out.
(referring to shotgun)
Now, pretend this is Jayne Kennedy. And you're you.
Then, in a blink, he points the shotgun at Floyd and blows him away.
Big D leaps off the bed and spins toward Drexl.
Drexl, waiting for him, fires from across the room.
The blast hits the big man in the right arm and shoulder, spinning him around.
Drexl makes a beeline for his victim and fires again.
Big D is hit with a blast, full in the back. He slams into the wall and drops.
Drexl collects the suitcase full of cocaine and leaves. As he gets to the front
door he surveys the carnage, spits and walks out.
EXT. CLIFF'S MOVING CAR ‚àö MORNING
A big white Chevy Nova is driving down the road with a sunrise sky as a
backdrop. The song ""Little Bitty Tear"" is heard a capella.
INT. CLIFF'S MOVING CAR ‚àö MORNING
CLIFF WORLEY is driving his car home from work, singing this song gently
to the sunrise. He's a forty-five-years-old ex-cop, at present a security guard. In
between singing he takes sips from a cup of take-out coffee. He's dressed in a
security guard uniform.
EXT. TRAILER PARK ‚àö MORNING
Cliff's Nova pulls in as he continues crooning. He pulls up to his trailer to see
something that stops him short.
CLIFF'S POV THROUGH WINDSHIELD
Clarence and a nice-looking YOUNG WOMAN are watching for him in front
of his trailer.
CLOSEUP ‚àö CLIFF
Upon seeing Clarence, a little bitty tear rolls down Cliff's cheek.
BACK TO:
CLIFF'S POV
Clarence and the Young Woman walk over to the car. Clarence sticks his face
through the driver's side window.
CLARENCE
Good Morning, Daddy. Long time no see.
INT. TRAILER HOME ‚àö MORNING
All three enter the trailer home.
CLIFF
Excuse the place, I haven't been entertaining company as of late. Sorry if
I'm acting a little dense, but you're the last person in the world I expected
to see this morning.
Clarence and the Young Girl walk into the living room.
CLARENCE
Yeah, well, tha's OK, Daddy, I tend to have that effect on people. I'm dyin'
on thirst, you got anything to drink?
He moves past Cliff and heads straight for his refridgerator.
CLIFF
I think there's a Seven-Up in there.
CLARENCE
(rumaging around the fridge)
Anything stronger?
(pause)
Oh, probably not. Beer? You can drink beer, can't you?
CLIFF
I can, but I don't.
CLARENCE
(closing the fridge)
That's about all I ever eat.
Cliff looks at the Girl. She smiles sweetly at him.
CLIFF
(to Girl)
I'm sorry... I'm his father.
YOUNG GIRL
(sticking her hand out)
That's OK, I'm his wife.
(shaking his hand vigorously)
Alabama Worley, pleased to meetcha.
She is really pumping his arm, just like a used-car salesman. However, that's
where the similarities end; Alabama's totally sincere.
Clarence steps back into the living room, holding a bunch of little ceramic fruit
magnets in his hand. He throws his other arm around Alabama.
CLARENCE
Oh yeah, we got married.
(referring to the magnets)
You still have these.
(to Alabama)
This isn't a complete set; when I was five I swallowed the pomegranate one.
I never shit it out, so I guess it's still there. Loverdoll, why don't you be a
sport and go get us some beer. I want some beer.
(to Cliff)
Do you want some beer? Well, if you want some it's here.
He hands her some money and his car keys.
CLARENCE
Go to the liquor store ‚àö
(to Cliff)
Where is there a liquor store around here?
CLIFF
Uh, yeah... there's a party store down 54th.
CLARENCE
(to Alabama)
Get a six-pack of something imported. It's hard to tell you what to get
cause different places have different things. If they got Fosters, get that, if
not, ask the guy at the thing what the strongest imported beer he has. Look,
since you're making a beer run, would you mind too terribly if you did a
foot run as well. I'm fuckin' starvin' to death. Are you hungry too?
ALABAMA
I'm pretty hungry. When I went to the store I was gonna get some Ding-
Dongs.
CLARENCE
Well, fuck that shit, we'll get some real food. What would taste good.
(to Cliff)
What do you think would taste good?
CLIFF
I'm really not very ‚àö
CLARENCE
You know what would taste good? Chicken. I haven't had chicken in a
while. Chicken would really hit the spot about now. Chicken and beer,
definitly, absolutely, without a doubt.
(to Cliff)
Where's a good chicken place around here?
CLIFF
I really don't know.
CLARENCE
You don't know the chicken places around where you live?
(to Alabama)
Ask the guy at the place where a chicken place is.
He gives her some more money.
CLARENCE
This should cover it, Auggie-Doggie.
ALABAMA
Okee-dokee, Doggie-Daddy.
She opens the door and starts out. Clarence turns to his dad as the door shuts.
CLARENCE
Isn't she the sweetest goddamned girl you ever saw in your whole life? Is
she a four alarm fire, or what?
CLIFF
She seems very nice.
CLARENCE
Daddy. Nice isn't the word. Nice is an insult. She's a peach. That's the only
word for it, she's a peach. She even tastes like a peach. You can tell I'm in
love with her. You can tell by my face, can't ya? It's a dead giveaway. It's
written all over it. Ya know what? She loves me back. Take a seat, Pop, we
gotta talk ‚àö
CLIFF
Clarence, just shut up, you're giving me a headache! I can't believe how
much like your mother you are. You're your fuckin' mother through and
through. I haven't heard from ya in three years. Then ya show up all of a
sudden at eight o'clock in the morning. You walk in like a goddamn
bulldozer... don't get me wrong, I'm happy to see you... just slow it down.
Now, when did you get married?
CLARENCE
Daddy, I'm in big fuckin' trouble and I really need your help.
BLACK TITLE CARD: ""HOLLYWOOD""
INT. OUTSIDE OF CASTING DIRECTOR'S OFFICER ‚àö DAY
FOUR YOUNG ACTORS are sitting on a couch with sheets of paper in their
hands silently mouthing lines. One of the actors is DICK RITCHIE. The casting
director, MARY LOUISE RAVENCROFT, steps into the waiting room, clip
board in hand.
RAVENCROFT
Dick Ritchie?
Dick pops up from the pack.
DICK
I'm me... I mean, that's me.
RAVENCROFT
Step inside.
INT. CASTING DIRECTOR'S OFFICE ‚àö DAY
She sits behind a large desk. Her name-plate rests on the desktop. Several
posters advertising ""The Return of T.J. Hooker"" hang on the wall.
Dick sits in a chair, holding his sheets in his hands.
RAVENCROFT
Well, the part you're reading for is one of the bad guys. There's Brian and
Marty. Peter Breck's already been cast as Brian. And you're reading for
the part of Marty. Now in this scene you're both in a car and Bill Shatner's
hanging on the hood. And what you're trying to do is get him off.
(she picks a up a copy of the script)
Whenever you're ready.
DICK
(reading and miming driving)
Where'd you come from?
RAVENCROFT
(reading from the script lifelessly)
I don't know. He just appeared as magic.
DICK
(reading from script)
Well, don't just sit there, shoot him.
She puts her script down, and smiles at him.
RAVENCROFT
That was very good.
DICK
Thank you.
RAVENCROFT
If we decided on making him a New York type, could you do that?
DICK
Sure. No problem.
RAVENCROFT
Could we try it now?
DICK
Absolutely.
Dick picks up the script and begins, but this time with a Brooklyn accent.
DICK
Where'd he come from?
RAVENCROFT
(monotone, as before)
I don't know. He just appeared as magic.
DICK
Well, don't just sit there, shoot him.
Ravencroft puts her script down.
RAVENCROFT
Well, Mr. Ritchie, I'm impressed. You're a very fine actor.
Dick smiles.
INT. TRAILER HOME ‚àö DAY
Cliff's completely aghast. He just stares, unable to come to grips with what
Clarence has told him.
CLARENCE
Look, I don't know this is pretty heavy-duty, so if you wanna explode, feel
free.
CLIFF
You're always making jokes. That's what you do, isn't it? Make jokes.
Making jokes is the one thing you're good at, isn't it? But if you make a
joke about this ‚àö
(raising his voice)
‚àö I'm gonna go completely out of my fuckin' head!
Cliff pauses and collects himself.
CLIFF
What do you want from me?
CLARENCE
What?
CLIFF
Stop acting like an infant. You're here because you want me to help you in
some way. What do you need from me? You need money?
CLARENCE
Do you still have friends on the force?
CLIFF
Yes, I still have friends on the force.
CLARENCE
Could you find out if they know anythin'? I don't know they know shit
about us. But I don't wanna think, I wanna know. You could find out for
sure what's goin' on.
(pause)
Daddy?
CLIFF
What makes you think I could do that?
CLARENCE
You were a cop.
CLIFF
What makes you think I would do that?
CLARENCE
I'm your son.
CLIFF
You got it all worked out, don't you?
CLARENCE
Look, goddamnit, I never asked you for a goddamn thing! I've tried to
make your parental obligation as easy as possible. After Mom divorced
you, did I ask you for anything? When I wouldn't see ya for six months to a
year at a time, did you ever get your shit about it? No, it was always ""OK"",
""No problem"", ""You're a busy guy, I understand"". The whole time you
were a drunk, did I ever point my finger at you and talk shit? No!
Everybody else did. I never did. You see, I know that you're just a bad
parent. You're not really very good at it. But I know you love me. I'm
basically a pretty resourceful guy. If I didn't really need it I wouldn't ask.
And if you say no, don't worry about it. I'm gone. No problems.
Alabama walks in through the door carrying a shopping bag.
ALABAMA
The forager's back.
CLARENCE
Thank God. I could eat a horse if you slap enough catsup on it.
ALABAMA
I didn't get any chicken.
CLARENCE
How come?
ALABAMA
It's nine o'clock in the morning. Nothing's open.
INT. TRAILER HOME ‚àö BEDROOM ‚àö DAY
Cliff's on the telephone in his bedroom, pacing as he talks. The living room od
the trailer can be seen from his doorway, where Clarence and Alabama are
horsing around. They giggle and cut up throughout the scene. As Cliff talks, all
the noise and hubbub of a police station comes through over the line. He's
talking to DETECTIVE WILSON, an old friend of his from the force.
We see both inside the conversation.
CLIFF
It's about that pimp that was shot a couple of days ago, Drexl Spivey.
WILSON
What about him?
CLIFF
Well, Ted, to tell you the truth, I found out through the grapevine that it
might be, and I only said might be, the Drexl Spivey that was responsible
for that restaurant break-in on Riverdale.
WILSON
Are you still working security for Foster & Langley?
CLIFF
Yeah, and the restaurant's on my route. And you know, I stuck my nose in
for the company to try to put a stop to some of these break-ins. Now, while
I have no proof, the name Drexl Spivey kept comin' up Who's case is it?
WILSON
McTeague.
CLIFF
I don't know him. Is he a nice guy? You think he'll help me out?
WILSON
I don't see why not. When you gonna come round and see my new place?
CLIFF
You and Robin moved?
WILSON
Shit, are you behind. Me and Robin got a divorce six months ago. Got
myself a new place ‚àö mirrors all over the bedroom, ceiling fans above the
bed. Guy'd have to look as ugly as King Kong not to get laid in this place.
I'm serious, a guy'd have to look like a gorilla.
CUT TO:
EXT. TRAILER HOME ‚àö DAY
Clarence and Cliff stand by Clarence's 1965 red Mustang. Alabama's amusing
herself by doing cartwheels and handstands in the background.
CLIFF
They have nothing. In fact, they think it's drug related.
CLARENCE
Do tell. Why drug related?
CLIFF
Apparently, Drexl had a big toe stuck in shit like that.
CLARENCE
No shit?
CLIFF
Yeah. Drexl had an association with a fella named Blue Lou Boyle. Name
mean anything to you?
CLARENCE
Nope.
CLIFF
If you don't hang around in this circle, no reason it should.
CLARENCE
Who is he?
CLIFF
Gangster. Drug Dealer. Somebody you don't want on your ass. Look,
Clarence, the more I hear about this Drexl fucker, the more I think you did
the right thing. That guy wasn't just some wild flake.
CLARENCE
That's what I've been tellin' ya. The guy was like a mad dog. So the cops
aren't looking for me?
CLIFF
Naw, until they hear something better they'll assume Drexl and Blue Lou
had a falling out. So, once you leave twon, I wouldn't worry about it.
Clarence sticks his hand out to shake. Cliff takes it.
CLARENCE
Thanks a lot, Daddy. You really came through for me.
CLIFF
I got some money I can give you ‚àö
CLARENCE
Keep it.
CLIFF
Well, son, I want you to know I hope everything works out with you and
Alabama. I like her. I think you make a cute couple.
CLARENCE
We do make a cute couple, don't we?
CLIFF
Yeah, well, just stay outta trouble. Remeber, you got a wife to think about.
Quit fuckin' around.
(pause)
I love you son.
They hug each other,
Clarence takes a pice of paper out and puts it into Cliff's hand.
CLARENCE
This is Dick's number in Hollywood. We don't know where we'll be, but
you can get a hold of me through him.
Clarence turns toward Alabama and yells to her.
CLARENCE
Bama, we're outta here. Kiss Pops goodbye,
Alabama runs across from where she was and throws her arms around Cliff
and gives him a big smackeroo on the lips. Cliff's a little startled. Alabama's
bubbling like a Fresca.
ALABAMA
Bye, Daddy! Hope to see you again real soon.
CLARENCE
(mock anger)
What kind of daughterly smackeroo was that?
ALABAMA
Oh, hush up.
The two get into the Mustang.
CLARENCE
(to Cliff)
We'll send you a postcard as soon as we get to Hollywood.
Clarence starts the engine. The convertible roof opens as they talk.
CLIFF
Bama, you take care of that one for me. Keep him out of trouble.
ALABAMA
Don't worry, Daddy, I'm keepin' this fella on a short leash.
Clarence, slowly, starts driving away.
CLARENCE
(to Cliff)
As the sun sets slowly in the west we bid a fond farewell to all the friends
we've made... and, with a touch of melancholy, we look forward to the time
when we will all be together again.
Clarence peels out, shooting a shower of gravel up in the air.
As the Mustang disappears Cliff runs his tongue over his lips.
CLIFF
The-son-of-a-bitch was right... she does taste like a peach.
INT. DICK'S APARTMENT ‚àö DAY
Dick's apartment is standard issue for a young actor. Things are pretty neat
and clean. A nice stereo unit sits on the shelf. A framed picture of a ballet
dancer's feet hangs on the wall.
The phone rings, Dick answers.
DICK
Hi, Dick here.
INT. HOTEL SUITE ‚àö LAS VEGAS ‚àö SUNSET
Top floor, Las Vegas, Nevada hotel room with a huge picture window
overlooking the neon-filled strip and the flaming red and orange sunset sky.
Clarence paces up and down with the telephone in his hand.
CLARENCE
(big bopper voice)
Heeeellllloooo baaaabbbbbyyyy!!!
Note: We intercut both sides of the conversation.
DICK
(unsure)
Clarence?
CLARENCE
You got it.
DICK
It's great to hear from you.
CLARENCE
Well, you're gonna be seein' me shortly.
DICK
You comin' to L.A.? When?
CLARENCE
Tomorrow.
DICK
What's up? Why're leavin' Detroit?
Clarence sits down on the hotel room bed. Alabama, wearing only a long T-
shirt with a big picture of Bullwinkle on it, crawls behind him.
CLARENCE
Well, there's a story behind all that. I'll tell you when I see you. By the way,
I won't be alone. I'm bringing my wife with me.
DICK
Get the fuck outta here!
CLARENCE
I'm married man.
DICK
Get the fuck outta here!
CLARENCE
Believe it or not, I actually tricked a girl into falling in love with me. I'm
not quite sure how I did it. I'd hate to have to do it again. But I did it.
Wanna say hi to my better half?
Before Dick can respond Clarence puts Alabama on the phone.
ALABAMA
Hi, Dick. I'm Alabama Worley.
DICK
Hello, Alabama.
ALABAMA
I can't wait to meet you. Clarence told me all about you. He said you were
his best friend. So, I guess that makes you my best friend, too.
Clarence start dictating to her what to say.
CLARENCE
Tell him we gotta go.
ALABAMA
Clarence says we gotta be hittin' it.
DICK
What?
CLARENCE
Tell him we'll be hittin' his area some time tomorrow.
ALABAMA
He said don't go nowhere. We'll be there some time tomorrow.
DICK
Wait a minute ‚àö
CLARENCE
Tell him not to eat anything. We're gonna scarf when we get there.
ALABAMA
Don't eat anything.
DICK
Alabama, could you tell Clar ‚àö
CLARENCE
Ask him if he got the letter.
ALABAMA
Did you get the letter?
DICK
What letter?
ALABAMA
(to Clarence)
What letter?
CLARENCE
The letter I sent.
ALABAMA
(to Dick)
The letter he sent.
DICK
Clarence sent a letter?
CLARENCE
Has he gotten his mail today?
ALABAMA
Gotten your mail yet?
DICK
Yeah, my room-mate leaves it on the TV.
ALABAMA
(to Clarence)
Yes.
CLARENCE
Has he looked through it yet?
ALABAMA
(to Dick)
Ya looked through it?
DICK
Not yet.
ALABAMA
(to Clarence)
Nope.
CLARENCE
Tell him to look through it.
ALABAMA
(to Dick)
Get it.
DICK
Let me speak to Clarence.
ALABAMA
(to Clarence)
He wants to speak with you.
CLARENCE
No time. Gotta go. Just tell him to read the letter, the letter explains all.
Tell him I love him. And tell him, as of tomorrow, all his money problems
are over.
ALABAMA
(to Dick)
He can't. We gotta go, but he wants you to read the letter. The letter
explains it all. He wants you to know he loves you. And he wants you to
know that as of tomorrow, all of your money problems are over.
DICK
Money problems?
CLARENCE
Now tell him goodbye.
ALABAMA
Bye-bye.
CLARENCE
Now hang up.
She hangs up the phone.
INT. DICK'S APARTMENT ‚àö DAY
Dick hears the click on the other end.
DICK
Hello, hello, Clarence? Clarence's wife?... I mean Alabama... hello?
Extremely confused, Dick jangs up the phone. He goes over to the TV and picks
up the day's mail. He goes through it.
BILL: Southern California Gas Company.
BILL: Group W.
BILL: Fossenkemp Photography.
BILL: Columbia Record and Tape Club.
LETTER: It's obviously from Clarence. Addressed to Dick. Dick opens it.
EXT. TRAILER ‚àö DAY
A lower-middle-class trailer park named Astro World, which has a neon sign in
front of it in the shape of a planet.
A big, white Chevy Nova pulls into the park. It parks by a trailer that's slightly
less kept up than the others. Cliff gets out of the Chevy. He's drinking out of a
fast-food soda cup as he opens the door to his trailer.
INT. TRAILER ‚àö DAY
He steps inside the doorway and then, before he knows it, a gun is pressed to
his temple and a big hand grabs his shoulder.
GUN CARRIER (DARIO)
Welcome home, alchy. We're havin' a party.
Cliff is roughly shoved into his living room. Waiting for him are four men,
standing: VIRGIL, FRANKIE (young Wise-guy) LENNY (an old Wise-guy),
and TOOTH-PICK VIC (a fireplug pitbull type).
Sitting in Cliff's recliner is VINCENZO COCCOTTI, the Frank Nitti to Detroid
mob leader Blue Lou Boyle.
Cliff is knocked to his knees. He looks up and sees the sitting Coccotti. Dario
and Lenny pick him up and roughly drop him in a chair.
COCCOTTI
(to Frankie)
Tell Tooth-pick Vic to go outside and do you-know-what.
In Italian Frankie tells Tooth-pick Vic what Coccotti said. He nods and exits.
Cliff's chair is moved closer to Coccotti's. Dario stands on one side of Cliff.
Frankie and Lenny ransack the trailer. Virgil has a bottle of Chivas Regal in his
hand, but he has yet to touch a drop.
COCCOTTI
Do you know who I am, Mr. Worley?
CLIFF
I give up. Who are you?
COCCOTTI
I'm the Anti-Christ. You get me in a vendetta kind of mood, you will tell
the angels in heaven that you had never seen pure evil so singularly
personified as you did in the face of the man who killed you. My name is
Vincenzo Coccotti. I work as a counsel for Mr. Blue Lou Boyle, the man
your son stole from. I hear you were once a cop so I assume you've heard
of us before. Am I correct?
CLIFF
I've heard of Blue Lou Boyle.
COCCOTTI
I'm glad. Hopefully that will clear up the how-full-of-shit-I-am question
you've been asking yourself. Now, we're gonna have a little Q and A, and,
at the risk of sounding redundant, please make your answers genuine.
(taking out a pack of Chesterfields)
Want a Chesterfield?
CLIFF
No.
COCCOTTI
(as he lights up)
I have a son of my own. About you boy's age. I can imagine how painful
this must be for you. But Clarence and that bitch-whore girlfriend of his
brought this all on themselves. And I implore you not to go down the road
with 'em. You can always take comfort in the fact that you never had a
choice.
CLIFF
Look, I'd help ya if I could, but I haven't seen Clarence ‚àö
Before Cliff can finish his sentence, Coccotti slams him hard in the nose with
his fist.
COCCOTTI
Smarts, don't it? Gettin' slammed in the nose fucks you all up. You got that
pain shootin' through your brain. Your eyes fill up with water. It ain't any
kind of fun. But what I have to offer you. That's as good as it's ever gonna
get, and it won't ever get that good again. We talked to your neighbors.
They saw a Mustang, a red Mustang, Clarence's red Mustang, parked in
front of your trailer yesterday. Mr. Worley, have you seen your son?
Cliff's defeated.
CLIFF
I've seen him.
COCCOTTI
Now I can't be sure of how much of what he told you. So in the chance
you're in the dark about some of this, let me shed some light. That whore
your boy hangs around with, her pimp is an associate of mine, and I don't
just mean pimpin', in other affairs he works for me in a courier capacity.
Well, apparently, that dirty little whore found out when we're gonna do
some business, cause your son, the cowboy and his flame, came in the room
blastin' and didn't stop till they were pretty sure everybody was dead.
CLIFF
What are you talkin' about?
COCCOTTI
I'm talkin' about a massacre. They snatched my narcotics and hightailed it
outta there. Wouldda gotten away with it, but your son, fuckhead that he is,
left his driver's license in a dead guy's hand. A whore hiding in the
commode filled in all the blanks.
CLIFF
I don't believe you.
COCCOTTI
That's of minor importance. But what's of major fuckin' importance is that
I believe you. Where did they go?
CLIFF
On their honeymoon.
COCCOTTI
I'm gettin' angry askin' the same question a second time. Where did they
go?
CLIFF
They didn't tell me.
Coccotti looks at him.
CLIFF
Now, wait a minute and listen. I haven't seen Clarence in three years.
Yesterday he shows up here with a girl, sayin' he got married. He told me
he needed some quick cash for a honeymoon, so he asked if he could
borrow five hundred dollars. I wanted to help him out so I wrote out a
check. We went to breakfast and that's the last I saw of him. So help me
God. They never thought to tell me where they were goin'. And I never
thought to ask.
Coccotti looks at him for a long moment. He then gives Virgil a look. Virgil,
quick as greased lightning, grabs Cliff's hand and turns it palm up. He then
whips out a butterfly knife and slices Cliff's palm open and pours Chivas Regal
on the wound. Cliff screams.
Coccotti puffs on a Chesterfield.
Tooth-pic Vic returns to the trailer, and reports in Italian that there's nothing in
the car.
Virgil walks into the kitchen and gets a dishtowel. Cliff holds his bleeding palm
in agony. Virgil hands him the dishtowel. Cliff uses it to wrap up his hand.
COCCOTTI
Sicilians are great liars. The best in the world. I'm a Sicilian. And my old
man was the world heavyweight champion of Sicilian liars. And from
growin' up with him I learned the pantomime. Now there are seventeen
different things a guy can do when he lies to give him away. A guy has
seventeen pantomimes. A woman's got twenty, but a guy's got seventeen.
And if you know 'em like ya know your own face, they beat lie detectors to
hell. What we got here is a little game of show and tell. You don't wanna
show me nothin'. But you're tellin' me everything. Now I know you know
where they are. So tell me, before I do some damage you won't walk away
from.
The awful pain in Cliff's hand is being replaced by the awful pain in his heart.
He looks deep into Coccotti's eyes.
CLIFF
Could I have one of those Chesterfields now?
COCCOTTI
Sure.
Coccotti leans over and hands him a smoke.
CLIFF
Got a match?
Cliff reaches into his pocket and pulls out a lighter.
CLIFF
Oh, don't bother. I got one.
(he lights the cigarette)
So you're a Sicilian, huh?
COCCOTTI
(intensly)
Uh-huh.
CLIFF
You know I read a lot. Especially things that have to do with history. I find
that shit fascinating. In fact, I don't know if you know this or not, Sicilians
were spawned by niggers.
All the men stop what they were doing and look at Cliff, except for Tooth-pic
Vic who doesn't speak English and so isn't insulted. Coccotti can't believe what
he's hearing.
COCCOTTI
Come again?
CLIFF
It's a fact. Sicilians have nigger blood pumpin' through their hearts. If you
don't believe me, look it up. You see, hundreds and hundreds of years ago
the Moors conquered Sicily. And Moors are niggers. Way back then,
Sicilians were like the wops in northern Italy. Blond hair, blue eyes. But,
once the Moors moved in there, they changed the whole country. They did
so much fuckin' with the Sicilian women, they changed the blood-line for
ever, from blond hair and blue eyes to black hair and dark skin. I find it
absolutely amazing to think that to this day, hundreds of years later,
Sicilians still carry that nigger gene. I'm just quotin' history. It's a fact. It's
written. Your ancestors were niggers. Your great, great, great, great, great-
grandmother was fucked by a nigger, and had a half-nigger kid. That is a
fact. Now tell me, am I lyin'?
Coccotti looks at him for a moment then jumps up, whips out an automatic,
grabs hold of Cliff's hair, puts the barrel to his temple, and pumps three bullets
through Cliff's head.
He pushes the body violently aside. Coccotti pauses. Unable to express his
feelings and frustrated by the blood in his hands, he simply drops his weapon,
and turns to his men.
COCCOTTI
I haven't killed anybody since 1974. Goddamn his soul to burn for eternity
in fuckin' hell for makin' me spill blood on my hands! Go to this
comedian's son's apartment and come back with somethin' that tells me
where that asshole went so I can wipe this egg off of my face and fix this
fucked-up family for good.
Tooth-pick Vic taps Frankie's shoulder and, in Italianm asks him what that was
all about.
Lenny, who has been going through Cliff's refridgerator, has found a beer.
When he closes the refridgerator door he finds a note held on by a ceramic
banana magnet that says: ""Clarence in L.A.: Dick Ritchie (number and

2YxT9DFbP1FUb1CDOOiHXz,Me Myself and I,Billy Holiday & Lester Young,154160,7,0.574,0.994,0.169,0.041,0.115,-18.48,0.119,159.328,0.646,"The United States government's support of slavery was based on an overpowering practicality. In 1790, a thousand tons of cotton were being produced every year in the South. By 1860, it was a million tons. In the same period, 500,000 slaves grew to 4 million. A system harried by slave rebellions and conspiracies (Gabriel Prosser, 1800; Denmark Vesey, 1822; Nat Turner, 1831) developed a network of controls in the southern states, hacked by the laws, courts, armed forces, and race prejudice of the nation's political leaders.
It would take either a full-scale slave rebellion or a full-scale war to end such a deeply entrenched system. If a rebellion, it might get out of hand, and turn its ferocity beyond slavery to the most successful system of capitalist enrichment in the world. If a war, those who made the war would organize its consequences. Hence, it was Abraham Lincoln who freed the slaves, not John Brown. In 1859, John Brown was hanged, with federal complicity, for attempting to do by small-scale violence what Lincoln would do by large-scale violence several years later-end slavery.
With slavery abolished by order of the government-true, a government pushed hard to do so, by blacks, free and slave, and by white abolitionists-its end could be orchestrated so as to set limits to emancipation. Liberation from the top would go only so far as the interests of the dominant groups permitted. If carried further by the momentum of war, the rhetoric of a crusade, it could be pulled back to a safer position. Thus, while the ending of slavery led to a reconstruction of national politics and economics, it was not a radical reconstruction, but a safe one- in fact, a profitable one.
The plantation system, based on tobacco growing in Virginia, North Carolina, and Kentucky, and rice in South Carolina, expanded into lush new cotton lands in Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi-and needed more slaves. But slave importation became illegal in 1808. Therefore, ""from the beginning, the law went unenforced,"" says John Hope Franklin (From Slavery to Freedom). ""The long, unprotected coast, the certain markets, and the prospects of huge profits were too much for the American merchants and they yielded to the temptation.. .."" He estimates that perhaps 250,000 slaves were imported illegally before the Civil War.
How can slavery be described? Perhaps not at all by those who have not experienced it. The 1932 edition of a best-selling textbook by two northern liberal historians saw slavery as perhaps the Negro's ""necessary transition to civilization."" Economists or cliometricians (statistical historians) have tried to assess slavery by estimating how much money was spent on slaves for food and medical care. But can this describe the reality of slavery as it was to a human being who lived inside it? Are the conditions of slavery as important as the existence of slavery?
John Little, a former slave, wrote:
They say slaves are happy, because they laugh, and are merry. I myself and three or four others, have received two hundred lashes in the day, and had our feet in fetters; yet, at night, we would sing and dance, and make others laugh at the rattling of our chains. Happy men we must have been! We did it to keep down trouble, and to keep our hearts from being completely broken: that is as true as the gospel! Just look at it,-must not we have been very happy? Yet I have done it myself-I have cut capers in chains.
A record of deaths kept in a plantation journal (now in the University of North Carolina Archives) lists the ages and cause of death of all those who died on the plantation between 1850 and 1855. Of the thirty-two who died in that period, only four reached the age of sixty, four reached the age of fifty, seven died in their forties, seven died in their twenties or thirties, and nine died before they were five years old.
But can statistics record what it meant for families to be torn apart, when a master, for profit, sold a husband or a wife, a son or a daughter? In 1858, a slave named Abream Scriven was sold by his master, and wrote to his wife: ""Give my love to my father and mother and tell them good Bye for me, and if we Shall not meet in this world I hope to meet in heaven.""
One recent book on slavery (Robert Fogel and Stanley Engerman, Time on the Cross) looks at whippings in 1840-1842 on the Barrow plantation in Louisiana with two hundred slaves: ""The records show that over the course of two years a total of 160 whippings were administered, an average of 0.7 whippings per hand per year. About half the hands were not whipped at all during the period."" One could also say: ""Half of all slaves were whipped."" That has a different ring. That figure (0.7 per hand per year) shows whipping was infrequent for any individual. But looked at another way, once every four or five days, some slave was whipped.
Barrow as a plantation owner, according to his biographer, was no worse than the average. He spent money on clothing for his slaves, gave them holiday celebrations, built a dance hall for them. He also built a jail and ""was constantly devising ingenious punishments, for he realized that uncertainty was an important aid in keeping his gangs well in hand.""
The whippings, the punishments, were work disciplines. Still, Herbert Gutman (Slavery and the Numbers Game) finds, dissecting Fogel and Engerman's statistics, ""Over all, four in five cotton pickers engaged in one or more disorderly acts in 1840-41.... As a group, a slightly higher percentage of women than men committed seven or more disorderly acts."" Thus, Gutman disputes the argument of Fogel and Engerman that the Barrow plantation slaves became ""devoted, hardworking responsible slaves who identified their fortunes with the fortunes of their masters.""
Slave revolts in the United States were not as frequent or as large-scale as those in the Caribbean islands or in South America. Probably the largest slave revolt in the United States took place near New Orleans in 1811. Four to five hundred slaves gathered after a rising at the plantation of a Major Andry. Armed with cane knives, axes, and clubs, they wounded Andry, killed his son, and began marching from plantation to plantation, their numbers growing. They were attacked by U.S. army and militia forces; sixty-six were killed on the spot, and sixteen were tried and shot by a firing squad.
The conspiracy of Denmark Vesey, himself a free Negro, was thwarted before it could be carried out in 1822. The plan was to burn Charleston, South Carolina, then the sixth-largest city in the nation, and to initiate a general revolt of slaves in the area. Several witnesses said thousands of blacks were implicated in one way or another. Blacks had made about 250 pike heads and bayonets and over three hundred daggers, according to Herbert Aptheker's account. But the plan was betrayed, and thirty-five blacks, including Vesey, were hanged. The trial record itself, published in Charleston, was ordered destroyed soon after publication, as too dangerous for slaves to see.
Nat Turner's rebellion in Southampton County, Virginia, in the summer of 1831, threw the slaveholding South into a panic, and then into a determined effort to bolster the security of the slave system. Turner, claiming religious visions, gathered about seventy slaves, who went on a rampage from plantation to plantation, murdering at least fifty-five men, women, and children. They gathered supporters, but were captured as their ammunition ran out. Turner and perhaps eighteen others were hanged.
Did such rebellions set back the cause of emancipation, as some moderate abolitionists claimed at the time? An answer was given in 1845 by James Hammond, a supporter of slavery:
But if your course was wholly different-If you distilled nectar from your lips and discoursed sweetest music.... do you imagine you could prevail on us to give up a thousand millions of dollars in the value of our slaves, and a thousand millions of dollars more in the depreciation of our lands ... ?
The slaveowner understood this, and prepared. Henry Tragic (The Southampton Slave Revolt of 1831), says:
In 1831, Virginia was an armed and garrisoned state... . With a total population of 1,211,405, the State of Virginia was able to field a militia force of 101,488 men, including cavalry, artillery, grenadiers, riflemen, and light infantry! It is true that this was a ""paper army"" in some ways, in that the county regiments were not fully armed and equipped, but it is still an astonishing commentary on the state of the public mind of the time. During a period when neither the State nor the nation faced any sort of exterior threat, we find that Virginia felt the need to maintain a security force roughly ten percent of the total number of its inhabitants: black and white, male and female, slave and free!
Rebellion, though rare, was a constant fear among slaveowners. Ulrich Phillips, a southerner whose American Negro Slavery is a classic study, wrote:
A great number of southerners at all times held the firm belief that the negro population was so docile, so little cohesive, and in the main so friendly toward the whites and so contented that a disastrous insurrection by them would be impossible. But on the whole, there was much greater anxiety abroad in the land than historians have told of....
Eugene Genovese, in his comprehensive study of slavery, Roll, Jordan, Roll, sees a record of ""simultaneous accommodation and resistance to slavery."" The resistance included stealing property, sabotage and slowness, killing overseers and masters, burning down plantation buildings, running away. Even the accommodation ""breathed a critical spirit and disguised subversive actions."" Most of this resistance, Genovese stresses, fell short of organized insurrection, but its significance for masters and slaves was enormous.
Running away was much more realistic than armed insurrection. During the 1850s about a thousand slaves a year escaped into the North, Canada, and Mexico. Thousands ran away for short periods. And this despite the terror facing the runaway. The dogs used in tracking fugitives ""bit, tore, mutilated, and if not pulled off in time, killed their prey,"" Genovese says.
Harriet Tubman, born into slavery, her head injured by an overseer when she was fifteen, made her way to freedom alone as a young woman, then became the most famous conductor on the Underground Railroad. She made nineteen dangerous trips back and forth, often disguised, escorting more than three hundred slaves to freedom, always carrying a pistol, telling the fugitives, ""You'll be free or die."" She expressed her philosophy: ""There was one of two things I had a right to, liberty or death; if I could not have one, I would have the other; for no man should take me alive....""
One overseer told a visitor to his plantation that ""some negroes are determined never to let a white man whip them and will resist you, when you attempt it; of course you must kill them in that case.""
One form of resistance was not to work so hard. W. E. B. Du Bois wrote, in The Gift of Black Folk:
As a tropical product with a sensuous receptivity to the beauty of the world, he was not as easily reduced to be the mechanical draft-horse which the northern European laborer became. He ... tended to work as the results pleased him and refused to work or sought to refuse when he did not find the spiritual returns adequate; thus he was easily accused of laziness and driven as a slave when in truth he brought to modern manual labor a renewed valuation of life.
Ulrich Phillips described ""truancy,"" ""absconding,"" ""vacations without leave,"" and ""resolute efforts to escape from bondage altogether."" He also described collective actions:
Occasionally, however, a squad would strike in a body as a protest against severities. An episode of this sort was recounted in a letter of a Georgia overseer to his absent employer: ""Sir, I write you a few lines in order to let you know that six of your hands has left the plantation-every man but Jack. They displeased me with their work and I give some of them a few lashes, Tom with the rest. On Wednesday morning, they were missing.""
The instances where poor whites helped slaves were not frequent, but sufficient to show the need for setting one group against the other. Genovese says:
The slaveholders ... suspected that non-slaveholders would encourage slave disobedience and even rebellion, not so much out of sympathy for the blacks as out of hatred for the rich planters and resentment of their own poverty. White men sometimes were linked to slave insurrectionary plots, and each such incident rekindled fears.
This helps explain the stern police measures against whites who fraternized with blacks.
Herbert Aptheker quotes a report to the governor of Virginia on a slave conspiracy in 1802: ""I have just received information that three white persons are concerned in the plot; and they have arms and ammunition concealed under their houses, and were to give aid when the negroes should begin."" One of the conspiring slaves said that it was ""the common run of poor white people"" who were involved.
In return, blacks helped whites in need. One black runaway told of a slave woman who had received fifty lashes of the whip for giving food to a white neighbor who was poor and sick.
When the Brunswick canal was built in Georgia, the black slaves and white Irish workers were segregated, the excuse being that they would do violence against one another. That may well have been true, but Fanny Kemble, the famous actress and wife of a planter, wrote in her journal:
But the Irish are not only quarrelers, and rioters, and fighters, and drinkers, and despisers of niggers-they are a passionate, impulsive, warm-hearted, generous people, much given to powerful indignations, which break out suddenly when not compelled to smoulder sullenly-pestilent sympathizers too, and with a sufficient dose of American atmospheric air in their lungs, properly mixed with a right proportion of ardent spirits, there is no saying but what they might actually take to sympathy with the slaves, and I leave you to judge of the possible consequences. You perceive, I am sure, that they can by no means be allowed to work together on the Brunswick Canal.
The need for slave control led to an ingenious device, paying poor whites-themselves so troublesome for two hundred years of southern history-to be overseers of black labor and therefore buffers for black hatred.
Religion was used for control. A book consulted by many planters was the Cotton Plantation Record and Account Book, which gave these instructions to overseers: ""You will find that an hour devoted every Sabbath morning to their moral and religious instruction would prove a great aid to you in bringing about a better state of things amongst the Negroes.""
As for black preachers, as Genovese puts it, ""they had to speak a language defiant enough to hold the high-spirited among their flock but neither so inflammatory as to rouse them to battles they could not win nor so ominous as to arouse the ire of ruling powers."" Practicality decided: ""The slave communities, embedded as they were among numerically preponderant and militarily powerful whites, counseled a strategy of patience, of acceptance of what could not be helped, of a dogged effort to keep the black community alive and healthy-a strategy of survival that, like its African prototype, above all said yes to life in this world.""
It was once thought that slavery had destroyed the black family. And so the black condition was blamed on family frailty, rather than on poverty and prejudice. Blacks without families, helpless, lacking kinship and identity, would have no will to resist. But interviews with ex-slaves, done in the 1930s by the Federal Writers Project of the New Deal for the Library of Congress, showed a different story, which George Rawick summarizes (From Sundown to Sunup):
The slave community acted like a generalized extended kinship system in which all adults looked after all children and there was little division between ""my children for whom I'm responsible"" and ""your children for whom you're responsible."" ... A kind of family relationship in which older children have great responsibility for caring for younger siblings is obviously more functionally integrative and useful for slaves than the pattern of sibling rivalry and often dislike that frequently comes out of contemporary middle-class nuclear families composed of highly individuated persons. ... Indeed, the activity of the slaves in creating patterns of family life that were functionally integrative did more than merely prevent the destruction of personality. ... It was part and parcel, as we shall see, of the social process out of which came black pride, black identity, black culture, the black community, and black rebellion in America.
Old letters and records dug out by historian Herbert Gutman (The Black Family in Slavery and Freedom) show the stubborn resistance of the slave family to pressures of disintegration. A woman wrote to her son from whom she had been separated for twenty years: ""I long to see you in my old age.. .. Now my dear son I pray you to come and see your dear old Mother. ... I love you Cato you love your Mother-You are my only son. ...""
And a man wrote to his wife, sold away from him with their children: ""Send me some of the children's hair in a separate paper with their names on the paper. ... I had rather anything to had happened to me most than ever to have been parted from you and the children. . . . Laura I do love you the same....""
Going through records of slave marriages, Gutman found how high was the incidence of marriage among slave men and women, and how stable these marriages were. He studied the remarkably complete records kept on one South Carolina plantation. He found a birth register of two hundred slaves extending from the eighteenth century to just before the Civil War; it showed stable kin networks, steadfast marriages, unusual fidelity, and resistance to forced marriages.
Slaves hung on determinedly to their selves, to their love of family, their wholeness. A shoemaker on the South Carolina Sea Islands expressed this in his own way: ""I'se lost an arm but it hasn't gone out of my brains.""
This family solidarity carried into the twentieth century. The remarkable southern black farmer Nate Shaw recalled that when his sister died, leaving three children, his father proposed sharing their care, and he responded:
That suits me. Papa. . .. Let's handle em like this; don't get the two little boys, the youngest ones, off at your house and the oldest one be at my house and we bold these little boys apart and won't bring em to see one another. I'll bring the little boy that I keep, the oldest one, around to your home amongst the other two. And you forward the others to my house and let em grow up knowin that they are brothers. Don't keep em separated in a way that they'll forget about one another. Don't do that, Papa.
Also insisting on the strength of blacks even under slavery, Lawrence Levine (Black Culture and Black Consciousness) gives a picture of a rich culture among slaves, a complex mixture of adaptation and rebellion, through the creativity of stories and songs:
We raise de wheat,
Dey gib us de corn;
We bake de bread,
Dey gib us de crust,
We sif de meal,
Dey gib us de huss;
We peel de meat,
Dey gib us de skin;
And dat's de way
Dey take us in;
We skim de pot,
Dey gib us de liquor,
An say dat's good enough for nigger.
There was mockery. The poet William Cullen Bryant, after attending a corn shucking in 1843 in South Carolina, told of slave dances turned into a pretended military parade, ""a sort of burlesque of our militia trainings. . . .""
Spirituals often had double meanings. The song ""O Canaan, sweet Canaan, I am bound for the land of Canaan"" often meant that slaves meant to get to the North, their Canaan. During the Civil War, slaves began to make up new spirituals with bolder messages: ""Before I'd be a slave, I'd be buried in my grave, and go home to my Lord and be saved."" And the spiritual ""Many Thousand Go"":
No more peck o ' corn for me, no more, no more,
No more driver's lash for me, no more, no more. . . .
Levine refers to slave resistance as ""pre-political,"" expressed in countless ways in daily life and culture. Music, magic, art, religion, were all ways, he says, for slaves to hold on to their humanity.
While southern slaves held on, free blacks in the North (there were about 130,000 in 1830, about 200,000 in 1850) agitated for the abolition of slavery. In 1829, David Walker, son of a slave, but born free in North Carolina, moved to Boston, where he sold old clothes. The pamphlet he wrote and printed, Walker's Appeal, became widely known. It infuriated southern slaveholders; Georgia offered a reward of $10,000 to anyone who would deliver Walker alive, and $1,000 to anyone who would kill him. It is not hard to understand why when you read his Appeal.
There was no slavery in history, even that of the Israelites in Egypt, worse than the slavery of the black man in America, Walker said. ""... show me a page of history, either sacred or profane, on which a verse can he found, which maintains, that the Egyptians heaped the insupportable insult upon the children of Israel, by telling them that they were not of the human family.""
Walker was scathing to his fellow blacks who would assimilate: ""I would wish, candidly ... to be understood, that I would not give a pinch of snuff to be married to any white person I ever saw in all the days of my life.""
Blacks must fight for their freedom, he said:
Let our enemies go on with their butcheries, and at once fill up their cup. Never make an attempt to gain our freedom or natural right from under our cruel oppressors and murderers, until you see your way clear-when that hour arrives and you move, be not afraid or dismayed. . .. God has been pleased to give us two eyes, two hands, two feet, and some sense in our heads as well as they. They have no more right to hold us in slavery than we have to hold them... . Our sufferings will come to an end, in spite of all the Americans this side of eternity. Then we will want all the learning and talents among ourselves, and perhaps more, to govern ourselves.-""Every dog must have its day,"" the American's is coming to an end.
One summer day in 1830, David Walker was found dead near the doorway of his shop in Boston.
Some born in slavery acted out the unfulfilled desire of millions. Frederick Douglass, a slave, sent to Baltimore to work as a servant and as a laborer in the shipyard, somehow learned to read and write, and at twenty-one, in the year 1838, escaped to the North, where he became the most famous black man of his time, as lecturer, newspaper editor, writer. In his autobiography, Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, he recalled his first childhood thoughts about his condition:
Why am I a slave? Why are some people slaves, and others masters? Was there ever a time when this was not so? How did the relation commence?
Once, however, engaged in the inquiry, I was not very long in finding out the true solution of the matter. It was not color, but crime, not God, but man, that afforded the true explanation of the existence of slavery; nor was I long in finding out another important truth, viz: what man can make, man can unmake. .. .
I distinctly remember being, even then, most strongly impressed with the idea of being a free man some day. This cheering assurance was an inborn dream of my human nature-a constant menace to slavery-and one which all the powers of slavery were unable to silence or extinguish.
The Fugitive Slave Act passed in 1850 was a concession to the southern states in return for the admission of the Mexican war territories (California, especially) into the Union as nonslave states. The Act made it easy for slaveowners to recapture ex-slaves or simply to pick up blacks they claimed had run away. Northern blacks organized resistance to the Fugitive Slave Act, denouncing President Fillmore, who signed it, and Senator Daniel Webster, who supported it. One of these was J. W. Loguen, son of a slave mother and her white owner. He had escaped to freedom on his master's horse, gone to college, and was now a minister in Syracuse, New York. He spoke to a meeting in that city in 1850:
The time has come to change the tones of submission into tones of defiance-and to tell Mr. Fillmore and Mr. Webster, if they propose to execute this measure upon us, to send on their blood-hounds. ... I received my freedom from Heaven, and with it came the command to defend my title to it. ... I don't respect this law-I don't fear it-I won't obey it! It outlaws me, and I outlaw it.... I will not live a slave, and if force is employed to re-enslave me, I shall make preparations to meet the crisis as becomes a man. ... Your decision tonight in favor of resistance will give vent to the spirit of liberty, and it will break the bands of party, and shout for joy all over the North. ... Heaven knows that this act of noble daring will break out somewhere-and may God grant that Syracuse be the honored spot, whence it shall send an earthquake voice through the land!
The following year, Syracuse had its chance. A runaway slave named Jerry was captured and put on trial. A crowd used crowbars and a battering ram to break into the courthouse, defying marshals with drawn guns, and set Jerry free.
Loguen made his home in Syracuse a major station on the Underground Railroad. It was said that he helped 1,500 slaves on their way to Canada. His memoir of slavery came to the attention of his former mistress, and she wrote to him, asking him either to return or to send her $1,000 in compensation. Loguen's reply to her was printed in the abolitionist newspaper, The Liberator:
Mrs. Sarah Logue. .. . You say you have offers to buy me, and that you shall sell me if I do not send you $1000, and in the same breath and almost in the same sentence, you say, ""You know we raised you as we did our own children."" Woman, did you raise your own children for the market? Did you raise them for the whipping post? Did you raise them to be driven off, bound to a coffle in chains? . .. Shame on you!
But you say I am a thief, because I took the old mare along with me. Have you got to learn that I had a better right to the old mare, as you call her, than Manasseth Logue had to me? Is it a greater sin for me to steal his horse, than it was for him to rob my mother's cradle, and steal me? . .. Have you got to learn that human rights are mutual and reciprocal, and if you take my liberty and life, you forfeit your own liberty and life? Before God and high heaven, is there a law for one man which is not a law for every other man?
If you or any other speculator on my body and rights, wish to know how I regard my rights, they need but come here, and lay their hands on me to enslave me.. . .
Yours, etc. J. W. Loguen
Frederick Douglass knew that the shame of slavery was not just the South's, that the whole nation was complicit in it. On the Fourth of July, 1852, he gave an Independence Day address:
Fellow Citizens: Pardon me, and allow me to ask, why am I called upon to speak here today? What have I or those I represent to do with your national independence? Are the great principles of political freedom and of natural justice, embodied in that Declaration of Independence, extended to us? And am I, therefore, called upon to bring our humble offering to the national altar, and to confess the benefits, and express devout gratitude for the blessings resulting from your independence to us?.. .
What to the American slave is your Fourth of July? I answer, a day that reveals to him more than all other days of the year, the gross injustice and cruelty to which he is the constant victim. 'To him your celebration is a sham; your boasted liberty an unholy license; your national greatness, swelling vanity; your sounds of rejoicing are empty and heartless; your denunciation of tyrants, brass- fronted impudence; your shouts of liberty and equality, hollow mockery; your prayers and hymns, your sermons and thanksgivings, with all your religious parade and solemnity, are to him mere bombast, fraud, deception, impiety, and hypocrisy-a thin veil to cover up crimes which would disgrace a nation of savages. There is not a nation of the earth guilty of practices more shocking and bloody than are the people of these United States at this very hour.
Go where you may, search where you will, roam through all the monarchies and despotisms of the Old World, travel through South America, search out every abuse and when you have found the last, lay your facts by the side of the everyday practices of this nation, and you will say with me that, for revolting barbarity and shameless hypocrisy, America reigns without a rival... .
Ten years after Nat Turner's rebellion, there was no sign of black insurrection in the South. But that year, 1841, one incident took place which kept alive the idea of rebellion. Slaves being transported on a ship, the Creole, overpowered the crew, killed one of them, and sailed into the British West Indies (where slavery had been abolished in 1833). England refused to return the slaves (there was much agitation in England against American slavery), and this led to angry talk in Congress of war with England, encouraged by Secretary of State Daniel Webster. The Colored Peoples Press denounced Webster's ""bullying position,"" and, recalling the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812, wrote:
If war be declared . .. Will we fight in defense of a government which denies us the most precious right of citizenship? .. . The States in which we dwell have twice availed themselves of our voluntary services, and have repaid us with chains and slavery. Shall we a third time kiss the foot that crushes us? If so, we deserve our chains.
As the tension grew, North and South, blacks became more militant. Frederick Douglass spoke in 1857:
Let me give you a word of the philosophy of reforms. The whole history of the progress of human liberty shows that all concessions yet made to her august claims have been born of struggle. ... If there is no struggle there is no progress. Those who profess to favor freedom and yet deprecate agitation, are men who want crops without plowing up the ground. They want rain without thunder and lightning. They want the ocean without the awful roar of its many waters. The struggle may be a moral one; or it may be a physical one; or it may be both moral and physical, but it must be a struggle. Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never did and it never will... .
There were tactical differences between Douglass and William Lloyd Garrison, white abolitionist and editor of The Liberator-differences between black and white abolitionists in general. Blacks were more willing to engage in armed insurrection, but also more ready to use existing political devices-the ballot box, the Constitution-anything to further their cause. They were not as morally absolute in their tactics as the Garrisonians. Moral pressure would not do it alone, the blacks knew; it would take all sorts of tactics, from elections to rebellion.
How ever-present in the minds of northern Negroes was the question of slavery is shown by black children in a Cincinnati school, a private school financed by Negroes. The children were responding to the question ""What do you think most about?"" Only five answers remain in the records, and all refer to slavery. A seven-year-old child wrote:
Dear schoolmates, we are going next summer to buy a farm and to work part of the day and to study the other part if we live to see it and come home part of the day to see our mothers and sisters and cousins if we are got any and see our kind folks and to be good boys and when we get a man to get the poor slaves from bondage. And I am sorrow to hear that the boat... went down with 200 poor slaves from up the river. Oh how sorrow I am to hear that, it grieves my heart so drat I could faint in one minute.
White abolitionists did courageous and pioneering work, on the lecture platform, in newspapers, in the Underground Railroad. Black abolitionists, less publicized, were the backbone of the antislavery movement. Before Garrison published his famous Liberator in Boston in 1831, the first national convention of Negroes had been held, David Walker had already written his ""Appeal,"" and a black abolitionist magazine named Freedom's Journal had appeared. Of The Liberator's first twenty-five subscribers, most were black.

The old humburgh looks a thing incomplete so. It is so. On its dead. But it will pawn up a fine head of porter when it is finished. In the quicktime. The castle arkwright put in a chequered staircase certainly. It has only one square step, to be steady, yet notwith-stumbling are they stalemating backgammoner supstairs by skips and trestles tiltop double corner. Whist while and game.
What scenic artist! It is ideal residence for realtar. By hims ingang tilt tinkt a tunning bell that Limen Mr, that Boggey Godde, be airwaked. Lingling, lingling. Be their maggies in all. Chump, do your ephort. Shop! Please shop! Shop ado please! O ado please shop! How hominous his house, haunt it? Yesses indead it be! Nogen, of imperial measure, is begraved beneadher. Here are his naggins poured, his alladim lamps. Around the bloombiered, booty with the bedst. For them whom he have fordone make we newly thankful!
Tell me something. The Porters, so to speak, after their shadowstealers in the newsbaggers, are very nice people, are they not? Very, all fourlike tellt. And on this wise, Mr, Porter (Bar-tholomew, heavy man, astern, mackerel shirt, hayamatt peruke) is an excellent forefather and Mrs Porter (leading lady, a poopahead, gaffneysaffron nightdress, iszoppy chepelure) is a most kindhearted messmother. A so united family pateramater is not more existing on papel or off of it. As keymaster fits the lock it weds so this bally builder to his streamline secret. They care for nothing except everything that is allporterous. Porto da Brozzo! Isn‚Äôt that terribly nice of them? You can ken that they come of a rarely old family by their costumance and one must togive that one supped of it in all tonearts from awe to zest. I think I begin to divine so much. Only snakkest me truesome! I stone us I‚Äôm hable. To reachy a skeer do! Still hoyhra, till venstra! Here are two rooms on the upstairs, at forkflank and at knifekanter. Whom in the wood are they for? Why, for little Porter babes, to be saved! The coeds, boytom thwackers and timbuy teaser. Here is one. thing you owed two noe. This one once upon awhile was the other but this is the other one nighadays. Ah so? The Corsicos? They are numerable. Guest them. Major bed, minor bickhive. Halosobuth, sov us! Who sleeps in now number one, for ex-ample? A pussy, purr esimple. Cunina, Statulina and Edulia, but how sweet of her! Has your pussy a pessname? Yes, indeed, you will hear it passim in all the noveletta and she is named Buttercup. Her bare name will tellt it, a monitress. How very sweet of her and what an excessively lovecharming missyname to forsake, now that I come to drink of it filtred, a gracecup fulled of bitterness. She is dadad‚Äôs lottiest daughterpearl and brooder‚Äôs cissiest auntybride. Her shellback thimblecasket mirror only can show her dearest friendeen. To speak well her grace it would ask of Grecian language, of her goodness, that legend golden. Biryina Saindua! Loreas with lillias flocaflake arrosas! Here‚Äôs newyearspray, the posquiflor, a windaborne and helio-trope; there miriamsweet and amaranth and marygold to crown. Add lightest knot unto tiptition. O Charis! O Charissima! A more intriguant bambolina could one not colour up out of Boccuccia‚Äôs Enameron. Would one but to do apart a lilybit her virginelles and, so, to breath, so, therebetween, behold, she had instantt with her handmade as to graps the myth inmid the air. Mother of moth! I will to show herword in flesh. Approach not for ghost sake! Itis dormition! She may think, what though little doth she realise, as morning fresheth, it hath happened her, you know what, as they too what two dare not utter. Silvoo plush, if scolded she draws a face. Petticoat‚Äôs asleep but in the gentlenest of her thoughts apoo is a nursepin. To be presented, Babs for Bim-bushi? Of courts and with enticers. Up, girls, and at him! Alone? Alone what? I mean, our strifestirrer, does she do fleurty winkies with herself Pussy is never alone, as records her chambrette, for she can always look at Biddles and talk petnames with her little playfilly when she is sitting downy on the ploshmat. O, she talks, does she? Marry, how? Rosepetalletted sounds. Ah Biddles es ma plikplak. Ah plikplak wed ma Biddles. A nice jezebel bary-tinette she will gift but I much prefer her missnomer in maidenly golden lasslike gladsome wenchful flowery girlish beautycapes. So do I, much. Dulce delicatissima! Doth Dolly weeps she is hastings. Will Dally bumpsetty it is tubtime. Allaliefest, she who pities very pebbles, dare we not wish on her our thrice onsk? A lovely fear! That she seventip toe her chrysming, that she spin blue to scarlad till her temple‚Äôs veil, that the Mount of Whoam it open it her to shelterer! She will blow ever so much more pro-misefuller, blee me, than all the other common marygales that romp round brigidschool, charming Carry Whambers or saucy Susy Maucepan of Merry Anna Patchbox or silly Polly Flinders. Platsch! A plikaplak.
And since we are talking amnessly of brukasloop crazedledaze, who doez in sleeproom number twobis? The twobirds. Holy policeman, O, I see! Of what age are your birdies? They are to come of twinning age so soon as they may be born to be eldering like those olders while they are living under chairs. They are and they seem to be so tightly tattached as two maggots to touch other, I think I notice, do I not? You do. Our bright bull babe Frank Kevin is on heartsleeveside. Do not you waken him! Our farheard bode. He is happily to sleep, limb of the Lord, with his lifted in blessing, his buchel Iosa, like the blissed angel he looks so like and his mou is semiope as though he were blowdelling on a bugigle. Whene‚Äôer I see those smiles in eyes ‚Äôtis Father Quinn again. Very shortly he will smell sweetly when he will hear a weird to wean. By gorgeous, that boy will blare some knight when he will take his dane‚Äôs pledges and quit our ingletears, spite of undesirable parents, to wend him to Amorica to quest a cashy job. That keen dean with his veen nonsolance! O, I adore the profeen music! Dollarmighty! He is too audorable really, eunique! I guess to have seen somekid like him in the story book, guess I met some-where somelam to whom he will be becoming liker. But hush! How unpardonable of me! I beg for your venials, sincerely I do.
Hush! The other, twined on codliverside, has been crying in his sleep, making sharpshape his inscissors on some first choice sweets fished out of the muck. A stake in our mead. What a teething wretch! How his book of craven images! Here are post-humious tears on his intimelle. And he has pipettishly bespilled himself from his foundingpen as illspent from inkinghorn. He is jem job joy pip poo pat (jot um for a sobrat!) Jerry Jehu. You will know him by name in the capers but you cannot see whose heel he sheepfolds in his wrought hand because I have not told it to you. O, foetal sleep! Ah, fatal slip! the one loved, the other left, the bride of pride leased to the stranger!He will be quite within the pale when with lordbeeron brow he vows him so tosset to be of the sir Blake tribes bleak while through life‚Äôs unblest he rodes backs of bannars. Are you not somewhat bulgar with your bowels? Whatever do you mean with bleak? With pale blake I write tint-ingface. O, you do? And with steelwhite and blackmail I ha‚Äôscint for my sweet an anemone‚Äôs letter with a gold of my bridest hair betied. Donatus his mark, address as follows. So you did? From the Cat and Cage. O, I see and see! In the ink of his sweat he will find it yet. What Gipsy Devereux vowed to Lylian and why the elm and how the stone. You never may know in the preterite all perhaps that you would not believe that you ever even saw to be about to. Perhaps. But they are two very blizky little portereens after their bredscrums, Jerkoff and Eatsup, as for my part opinion indeed. They would be born so, costarred, puck and prig, the maryboy at Donnybrook Fair, the godolphing-lad in the Hoy‚Äôs Court. How frilled one shall be as at taledold of Formio and Cigalette! What folly innocents! Theirs whet pep of puppyhood! Both barmhearts shall become yeastcake by their brackfest. I will to leave a my copperwise blessing between the pair of them, for rosengorge, for greenafang. Blech and tin soldies, weals in a sniffbox. Som‚Äôs wholed, all‚Äôs parted. Weeping shouldst not thou be when man falls but that divine scheming ever adoring be. So you be either man or mouse and you be neither fish nor flesh. Take. And take. Vellicate nyche! Be ones as wes for gives for gives now the hour of passings sembles quick with quelled. Adieu, soft adieu, for these nice presents, kerryjevin. Still tosorrow!
Jeminy, what is the view which now takes up a second position of discordance, tell it please? Mark! You notice it in that rereway because the male entail partially eclipses the femecovert. It is so called for its discord the meseedo. Do you ever heard the story about Helius Croesus, that white and gold elephant in our zoopark? You astonish me by it. Is it not that we are commanding from fullback, woman permitting, a profusely fine birdseye view from beauhind this park? Finn his park has been much the admiration of all the stranger ones, grekish and romanos, who arrive to here. The straight road down the centre (see relief map) bisexes the park which is said to be the largest of his kind in the world. On the right prominence confronts you the handsome vinesregent‚Äôs lodge while, turning to the other supreme piece of cheeks, exactly opposite, you are confounded by the equally hand-some chief sacristary‚Äôs residence. Around is a little amiably tufted and man is cheered when he bewonders through the boskage how the nature in all frisko is enlivened by gentlemen‚Äôs seats. Here are heavysuppers ‚Äî ‚Äôtis for daddies housings for hun-dredaires of our super thin thousand. By gum, but you have resin! Of these tallworts are yielded out juices for jointoils and pappasses for paynims. Listeneth! ‚ÄôTis a tree story. How olave, that firile, was aplantad in her liveside. How tannoboom held tonobloom. How rood in norlandes. The black and blue marks athwart the weald, which now barely is so stripped, indicate the presence of sylvious beltings. Therewithal shady rides lend themselves out to rustic cavalries. In yonder valley, too, stays mountain sprite. Any pretty dears are to be caught inside but it is a bad pities of the plain. A scarlet pimparnell now mules the mound where anciently first murders were wanted to take root. By feud fionghalian. Talkingtree and sinningstone stay on either hand. Hystorical leavesdroppings may also be gar-nered up with sir Shamus Swiftpatrick, Archfieldchaplain of Saint Lucan‚Äôs. How familiar it is to see all these interesting advenements with one snaked‚Äôs eyes! Is all? Yet not. Hear one‚Äôs. At the bodom fundus of this royal park, which, with tvigate shyasian gardeenen, is open to the public till night at late, so well the sissastrides so will the pederestians, do not fail to point to yourself a depression called Holl Hollow. It is often quite guttergloomering in our duol and gives wankyrious thoughts to the head but the banders of the pentapolitan poleetsfurcers bassoons into it on windy woodensdays their wellbooming wolvertones. Ulvos! Ulvos!
Whervolk dorst ttou begin to tremble by our moving pictures at this moment when I am to place my hand of our true friend-shapes upon thee knee to mark well what I say? Throu shayest who? In Amsterdam there lived a . . . But how? You are trem-blotting, you retchad, like a verry jerry! Niet? Will you a gui ‚Äî neeser? Gaij beutel of staub? To feel, you? Yes, how it trembles, the timid!

When you‚Äôre coaching through Lucalised, on the sulphur spa to visit, it‚Äôs safer to hit than miss it, stop at his inn! The hammers are telling the cobbles, the pickts are hacking the saxums, it‚Äôs snugger to burrow abed than ballet on broadway. Tuck in your blank! For it‚Äôs race pound race the hosties rear all roads to ruin and layers by lifetimes laid down riches from poormen. Cried unions to chip, saltpetre to strew, gallpitch to drink, stonebread to break but it‚Äôs bully to gulp good blueberry pudding. Doze in your warmth! While the elves in the moonbeams, feeling why, will keep my lilygem gently gleaming.
In the sleepingchambers. The court to go into half morning. The four seneschals with their palfrey to be there now, all balaaming in their sellaboutes and sharping up their penisills. The boufeither Soakersoon at holdup tent sticker. The swabsister Katya to have duntalking and to keep shakenin dowan her drogh-edars. Those twelve chief barons to stand by duedesmally with their folded arums and put down all excursions and false alarums and after that to go back now to their runameat farums and re-compile their magnum chartarums with the width of the road between them and all harrums. The maidbrides all, in favours gay, to strew sleety cinders on their falling hair and for wouldbe joybells to ring sadly ringless hands. The dame dowager to stay kneeled how she is, as first mutherer with cord in coil. The two princes of the tower royal, daulphin and deevlin, to lie how they are without to see. The dame dowager‚Äôs duffgerent to present wappon, blade drawn to the full and about wheel without to be seen of them. The infant Isabella from her coign to do obeisance toward the duffgerent, as first futherer with drawn brand. Then the court to come in to full morning. Herein see ye fail not!

He, he, he! At that do you leer, a setting up? With a such unfettered belly? Two cascades? I leer (O my big, O my bog, O my bigbagbone!) because I must see a buntingcap of so a pinky on the point. It is for a true glover‚Äôs greetings and many burgesses by us, greats and grosses, uses to pink it in this way at tet-at-tet. For long has it been effigy of standard royal when broken on roofstaff which to the gunnings shall cast welcome from Courtmilits‚Äô Fortress, umptydum dumptydum. Bemark you these hangovers, those streamer fields, his influx. Do you not have heard that, the queen lying abroad from fury of the gales, (meekname mocktitles her Nan Nan Nanetta) her liege of lateenth dignisties shall come on their bay tomorrow, Michalsmas, mellems the third and fourth of the clock, there to all the king‚Äôs aussies and all their king‚Äôs men, knechts tramplers and cavalcaders, led of herald graycloak, Ulaf Goldarskield?

Here are gantlets. I believe, by Plentifolks Mixymost! Yet if I durst to express the hope how I might be able to be pre-sent.

Ay yo, put the beat on
Boom, pain, underrated legend, pain, pain, pain, pain
Wallahi this is all true, it's all true still
Ight, look

So a big part of my life has been chicks
I know I can't lie about that
And if I keep it real
I never thought again I'd have to write about that
See, word I was still in love when I wrote ""Slut""
Just words, them scars weren't closed up
But since it gave me exposure, it's only right I tell you my closure
Slut
Man I was so real to the page, so real to the extent that
Man I even used real names, Cherise she text me once on a mad ting
Tara kinda treats me like a germ and the girl that done the monkey bar ting
Well, well she's just doing her
Man listen
Not that same one that my last freestyle was about
But love from west to the south
Thought I was over the girl until I saw her out
And family I was all shocked 'cause I've been thinking about this girl like every day in every way
So yeah of course we speak and numbers exchange and now I'm happy as fuck
Because now I'm back with the love of my life, doing all kind of shit like kissing on north while it was two o'clock at night
A good guy now, I ain't hitting whenever
Even crashed my car spitting together
You know when the kiss is perfect, come like puzzle pieces fitting together
That's when I told her ""Wait though, if we're doing this then we've gotta do this right
""I'ma tell you all the shit that I've been on the last couple years, there's shit you won't like
""But I'ma be honest and I'ma be real to the T
""I've gotta make sure some next girl can never come to you about me""
And that's when I started talking
Man I told her all of the girls that I beat, all the problems with me
The one night stands and the girls that I met on IG
But when it was her turn she said ""There ain't a dream I can sell you
""And really my life's been boring, and there ain't nothing to tell you""
And man I believed her, maybe I was naive
Or gassed that the girl I was thinking about for the last four years was by me
And like that feeling it weren't gone away
And her mum even took us on a holiday
Now i'm deep in her an I ain't gotta ease in shit
Couple months in, I've got the key to the crib
But, but then I got distant though 'cause I got that iffy vibe
Like, I'll be catching her out telling silly lies
Like, if you're my woman then why I gotta catch you out?
And it's dumb shit, like shit you ain't even gotta lie about
And this is when I turned into a fuckboy, man I can't lie man, I just weren't with it
Even though I still loved her mad, something couldn't sit with my spirit
Never called her beautiful once, no attention, her time I had none of it
The most I would do, pull up on a late night random one if I felt like cuddling
And that's when I got that phone call though
And you know how it goes like, like ""Blaine, there's something you should know
""I just took a pregnancy test, and look man, it came back positive
""And right now I can't have an abortion, looks like we just gotta get on with it""
And me I can't lie how I acted, it was all loose man, I started backtracking
When I heard the word 'baby' I just panicked
And asked her again ""Are you sure you wanna have it?""
And she said the doctors told her before that she can't have a baby
So the thought of having an abortion, na, na, having a yout' is all crazy now
Look, see when a baby ain't planned
There's some stages you go through as a man
The first stage is na, she ain't having this yout', I gotta talk to her harder
The second stage is look man I gotta man up because I'm gonna be a father
Pull it off, I still told my mother, I'm thinking that she's gonna get mad at me
And all she said was ""Blaine, do not bring a mad gyal in my family""
Told my sister but she weren't having it, and right now I'm excited
But anyway fuck that part, it's the second part that hit me like lightning
I got a phone call out of the blue like ""Blaine where you at? And can you come round?""
And I said ""Now?"" and she said ""Now!""
So I says ""fuck it"" and drove from South
Blew until I pulled up to the crib, got in the lift, put the key through the door
And all I can see is her there, with her arms around her belly on the floor
I'm like ""Yo baby, tell me what's wrong?"" she's saying ""I've bled and my belly keeps hurting""
I keep phoning the ambulance over and over again but this shit ain't working
They pull up in what seems like forever, me I'm shocked, I don't know what it means
We get to the hospital, they take her blood, holding her hand waiting to be seen
And then some young white lady steps in
She clears her throat and she looks up slow and says ""You're no longer pregnant""
And, man it kinda hit me in the worst way
'Cause it happened like three days before my birthday
Now, now me and her's back on track, but I can't like a real shot I ain't giving it
'Cause I've got this feeling saying that I can't trust her, and look man, I can't get rid of it
Man I gotta talk to her, I gotta talk to her, I'ma see her next week and that's when I'll talk to her
I picked her up so I can drop her at airport, I said I'm tired so she can drive
And I'm just there in the passenger seat and I'm looking at her square in the eyes
And I say ""What I'm about to say, man I ain't tryna cuss you
""I really wanna make this work but I feel like I can't trust you
""And look I don't know what it is but I've got a feeling so deep in my ribs
""Months ago you was gonna have my kid and now I feel that the solution is to...
""Let me have a look in your phone, it might sound dumb and I might sound young but let me have a look in your phone
""Don't get it twisted, I'm grown but let me have a look in your phone
""I'll see nothing, I'll stop bugging, we'll get to trusting, we'll build something, you'll probably be cussing
""Like I told you there was nothing in my phone, and word on my life, I'll let that go
""But let me have a look in your phone"" and then she said ""No"" and I said ""Word? I swear you want me to take you serious, and word that's what I'm tryna do
""So, you've gotta respect how I'm tryna move
""Five years deep, you'll let that go, just to not let me look in your phone""
She looked back with a worried and scared face and then she said ""No""
And look you see that kinda iffy, man I let that go so quickly, still went to the airport just to let her off
And then I put my key right though the letter box
Look, what was in her phone? Man I would never know
But nine times out of ten there was the maddest tings in her phone
Now I get a phone call few days later, she's like ""Hi"", I'm like ""Waddup?""
She's like ""Now you can look through my phone"" I'm like ""Shut up""
Three months after, I'm in Shoreditch, and I see her cousin
And she pulls me to the side like ""I wanna talk to you about something""
And I'm like ""Calm, we can step out the bar, and me and you can go and speak in the car""
And she's like ""I don't talk to my cousin no more man, she takes things kind of far""
And I'm like ""Wait there, what do you wanna say to me?""
And she goes ""Uhm, shit, I don't know how to say this but, I don't really wanna say no dirt
""But when you was with her, she was chatting to a couple man, and there was this guy from work
""And when she was having his kid, she showed up to my crib 'cause she weren't sure like if it was yours or his""
And I said ""Wait there, how do you know?""
She says ""On my daughter's life I know, and I'm only telling you because I don't speak to her anymore""
And I couldn't care about the cheating but the child shit hit me harder
Man I got excited and I told my mum that I might not have been that father
But I guess I didn't know that lady
After the miscarriage, shit got crazy
She looked back like ""Miscarriage, what?"" I said ""Yeah, she miscarried my baby""
She said ""Wait there Blaine, are you sure?""
I said ""I saw her on the floor
""We both went to the hospital and they said that the child weren't there anymore""
And she said ""When this happen? Around the end of Feb?""
I said ""Yeah, how you know?"" she said ""Fuck man, these girls are dred""
I said ""Wait, what you mean?"" she said ""On my daughter's life I'm talking
""But in the middle of February, I took her to get an abortion""
See gyal are fucked like that
Yeah man fuck up, but mans fuck ups ain't fucked like that
Are you even clocking the play?
So the miscarriage and her being on the floor was all staged
And then they ask why man's so bitter
And man turned into your average nigga
Saying how you can't trust these women, trust rudeboy, man it can't get realer
But if I learnt one thing out of this whole thing, you've gotta go with your gut
But you ain't gotta take my advice 'cause I'm just Cadet AKA The Slut
You feel me?

INT. BAR ‚àö NIGHT
A smoky cocktail bar downtown Detroit.
CLARENCE WORLEY, a young hipster hepcat, is trying to pick up an older
lady named LUCY. She isn't bothered by him, in fact, she's alittle charmed. But,
you can tell, that she isn't going to leave her barstool.
CLARENCE
In ""Jailhouse Rock"" he's everything rockabilly's about. I mean he is
rockabilly: mean, surly, nasty, rude. In that movie he couldn't give a fuck
about anything except rockin' and rollin', livin' fast, dyin' young, and
leaving a good-looking corpse. I love that scene where after he's made it big
he's throwing a big cocktail party, and all these highbrows are there, and
he's singing, ""Baby You're So Square... Baby, I Don't Care"". Now, they got
him dressed like a dick. He's wearing these stupid-lookin' pants, this
horrible sweater. Elvis ain't no sweater boy. I even think they got him
wearin' penny loafers. Despite all that shit, all the highbrows at the party,
big house, the stupid clothes, he's still a rude-lookin' motherfucker. I'd
watch that hillbilly and I'd want to be him so bad. Elvis looked good. I'm
no fag, but Elvis was good-lookin'. He was fuckin' prettier than most
women. I always said if I ever had to fuck a guy... I mean had too cause my
life depended on it... I'd fuck Elvis.
Lucy takes a drag from her cigarette.
LUCY
I'd fuck Elvis.
CLARENCE
Really?
LUCY
When he was alive. I wouldn't fuck him now.
CLARENCE
I don't blame you.
(they laugh)
So we'd both fuck Elvis. It's nice to meet people with common interests,
isn't it?
Lucy laughs.
CLARENCE
Well, enough about the King, how 'bout you?
LUCY
How 'bout me what?
CLARENCE
How 'bout you go to the movies with me tonight?
LUCY
What are we gonna see?
CLARENCE
A Donny Chiba triple feature. ""The Streetfighter"", ""Return of the
Streetfighter"", and ""Sister Streetfighter"".
LUCY
Who's Sonny Chiba?
CLARENCE
He is, bar none, the greatest actor working in martial arts movies ever.
LUCY
(not believing this)
You wanna take me to a kung fu movie?
CLARENCE
(holding up three fingers)
Three kung fu movies.
Lucy takes a drag from her cigarette.
LUCY
(laughing)
I don't think so, not my cup of tea.
INT. DINGY HOTEL ROOM ‚àö DAY
The sounds of the city flow in through an open window: car horns, gun shots
and violence. Paint is peeling off the walls and the once green carpet is stained
black.
On the bed nearby is a huge open suitcase filled with clear plastic bags of
cocaine. Shotguns and pistols have been dropped carelessly around the
suitcase. On the far end of the room, against the wall, is a TV. ""Bewitched"" is
playing.
At the opposite end of the room, by the front, is a table. DREXL SPIVEY and
FLOYD DIXON sit around. Cocaine is on the table as well as little plastic
bags and a weigher. Floyd is black, Drexl is a white boy, though you wouldn't
know it listen to him.
DREXL
Nigger, get outta my face with that bullshit.
FLOYD
Naw man, I don't be eatin' that shit.
DREXL
That's bullshit.
BIG DON WATTS, a stout, mean-looking black man who's older than Drexl
and Floyd. Walks through the door carrying hamburgers and french fries in
two greasy brown-paper bags.
FLOYD
Naw man, that's some serious shit.
DREXL
Nigger, you lie like a big dog.
BIG D
What the fuck are you talkin' about?
DREXL
Floyd say he don't be eatin' pussy.
BIG D
Shit, any nigger say he don't eat pussy is lyin' his ass off.
DREXL
I heard that.
FLOYD
Hold on a second, Big D. You sayin' you eat pussy?
BIG D
Nigger, I eat everything. I eat pussy. I eat the butt. I eat every
motherfuckin' thang.
DREXL
Preach on, Big D.
FLOYD
Look here. If I ever did eat some pussy ‚àö I would never eat any pussy ‚àö but,
if I did eat some pussy, I sure as hell wouldn't tell no goddamn body. I'd be
ashamed as a motherfucker.
BIG D
Shit! Nigger you smoke enough sherm your dumb ass'll do a lot a crazy ass
things. So you won't eat pussy? Motherfucker, you be up there suckin'
niggers' dicks.
DREXL
Heard that.
Drexl and Big D bump fists.
FLOYD
Yeah, that's right, laugh. It's so funny, oh it's so funny.
(he takes a hit off of a joint)
There used to be a time when sisters didn't know shit about gettin' their
pussy licked. Then the sixties came an' they started fuckin' around with
white boys. And white boys are freaks for that shit ‚àö
DREXL
‚àö Because it's good!
FLOYD
Then, after a while sisters use to gettin' their little pussy eat. And because
you white boys had to make pigs out of yourselves, you fucked it up for
every nigger in the world everywhere.
BIG D
Drexl. On behalf of me and all the brothers who aren't here, I'd like to
express our gratitude ‚àö
Drexl and Big D bust up.
FLOYD
Go on pussy-eaters... laugh. You look like you be eatin' pussy. You got
pussy-eatin' mugs. Now if a nigger wants to get his dick sucked he's got to
do a bunch of fucked-up shit.
BIG D
So you do eat pussy!
FLOYD
Naw naw!
BIG D
You don't like it, but you eat that shit.
(to Drexl)
He eats it.
DREXL
Damn skippy. He like it, too.
BIG D
(mock English accent)
Me thinketh he doth protest too much.
FLOYD
Well fuck you guys then! You guys are fucked up!
DREXL
Why you trippin'? We jus' fuckin' with ya. But I wanna ask you a question.
You with some fine bitch, I mean a brick shithouse bitch ‚àö you're with
Jayne Kennedy. You're with Jayne Kennedy and you say ""Bitch, suck my
dick!"" and then Jayne Kennedy says, ""First things first, nigger, I ain't
suckin' shit till you bring your ass over here and lick my bush!"" Now, what
do you say?
FLOYD
I tell Jayne Kennedy, ""Suck my dick or I'll beat your ass!""
BIG D
Nigger, get real. You touch Jayne Kennedy she'll have you ass in Wayne
County so fast ‚àö
DREXL
Nigger, back off, you ain't beatin' shit. Now what would you do.
FLOYD
I'd say fuck it!
Drexl and Big D get up from the table disgusted and walk away, leaving Floyd
sitting all alone.
Big D sits on the bed, his back turned to Floyd, watching ""Bewitched"".
FLOYD
(yelling after them)
Ain't no man have to eat pussy!
BIG D
(not even looking)
Take that shit somewhere else.
DRXL
(marching back)
You tell Jayne Kennedy to fuck it?
FLOYD
If it came down to who eats who, damn skippy.
DREXL
With that terrible mug of yours if Jayne Kennedy told you to eat her pussy,
kiss her ass, lick her feet, chow on her shit, and suck her dog's dick, nigger,
you'd aim to please.
BIG D
(glued on TV)
I'm hip.
DREXL
In fact, I'm gonna show you what I mean with a little demonstration. Big D,
toss me that shotgun.
Without turning away from ""Bewitched"" he picks up the shotgun and tosses it to
Drexl.
DREXL
(to Floyd)
All right, check this out.
(referring to shotgun)
Now, pretend this is Jayne Kennedy. And you're you.
Then, in a blink, he points the shotgun at Floyd and blows him away.
Big D leaps off the bed and spins toward Drexl.
Drexl, waiting for him, fires from across the room.
The blast hits the big man in the right arm and shoulder, spinning him around.
Drexl makes a beeline for his victim and fires again.
Big D is hit with a blast, full in the back. He slams into the wall and drops.
Drexl collects the suitcase full of cocaine and leaves. As he gets to the front
door he surveys the carnage, spits and walks out.
EXT. CLIFF'S MOVING CAR ‚àö MORNING
A big white Chevy Nova is driving down the road with a sunrise sky as a
backdrop. The song ""Little Bitty Tear"" is heard a capella.
INT. CLIFF'S MOVING CAR ‚àö MORNING
CLIFF WORLEY is driving his car home from work, singing this song gently
to the sunrise. He's a forty-five-years-old ex-cop, at present a security guard. In
between singing he takes sips from a cup of take-out coffee. He's dressed in a
security guard uniform.
EXT. TRAILER PARK ‚àö MORNING
Cliff's Nova pulls in as he continues crooning. He pulls up to his trailer to see
something that stops him short.
CLIFF'S POV THROUGH WINDSHIELD
Clarence and a nice-looking YOUNG WOMAN are watching for him in front
of his trailer.
CLOSEUP ‚àö CLIFF
Upon seeing Clarence, a little bitty tear rolls down Cliff's cheek.
BACK TO:
CLIFF'S POV
Clarence and the Young Woman walk over to the car. Clarence sticks his face
through the driver's side window.
CLARENCE
Good Morning, Daddy. Long time no see.
INT. TRAILER HOME ‚àö MORNING
All three enter the trailer home.
CLIFF
Excuse the place, I haven't been entertaining company as of late. Sorry if
I'm acting a little dense, but you're the last person in the world I expected
to see this morning.
Clarence and the Young Girl walk into the living room.
CLARENCE
Yeah, well, tha's OK, Daddy, I tend to have that effect on people. I'm dyin'
on thirst, you got anything to drink?
He moves past Cliff and heads straight for his refridgerator.
CLIFF
I think there's a Seven-Up in there.
CLARENCE
(rumaging around the fridge)
Anything stronger?
(pause)
Oh, probably not. Beer? You can drink beer, can't you?
CLIFF
I can, but I don't.
CLARENCE
(closing the fridge)
That's about all I ever eat.
Cliff looks at the Girl. She smiles sweetly at him.
CLIFF
(to Girl)
I'm sorry... I'm his father.
YOUNG GIRL
(sticking her hand out)
That's OK, I'm his wife.
(shaking his hand vigorously)
Alabama Worley, pleased to meetcha.
She is really pumping his arm, just like a used-car salesman. However, that's
where the similarities end; Alabama's totally sincere.
Clarence steps back into the living room, holding a bunch of little ceramic fruit
magnets in his hand. He throws his other arm around Alabama.
CLARENCE
Oh yeah, we got married.
(referring to the magnets)
You still have these.
(to Alabama)
This isn't a complete set; when I was five I swallowed the pomegranate one.
I never shit it out, so I guess it's still there. Loverdoll, why don't you be a
sport and go get us some beer. I want some beer.
(to Cliff)
Do you want some beer? Well, if you want some it's here.
He hands her some money and his car keys.
CLARENCE
Go to the liquor store ‚àö
(to Cliff)
Where is there a liquor store around here?
CLIFF
Uh, yeah... there's a party store down 54th.
CLARENCE
(to Alabama)
Get a six-pack of something imported. It's hard to tell you what to get
cause different places have different things. If they got Fosters, get that, if
not, ask the guy at the thing what the strongest imported beer he has. Look,
since you're making a beer run, would you mind too terribly if you did a
foot run as well. I'm fuckin' starvin' to death. Are you hungry too?
ALABAMA
I'm pretty hungry. When I went to the store I was gonna get some Ding-
Dongs.
CLARENCE
Well, fuck that shit, we'll get some real food. What would taste good.
(to Cliff)
What do you think would taste good?
CLIFF
I'm really not very ‚àö
CLARENCE
You know what would taste good? Chicken. I haven't had chicken in a
while. Chicken would really hit the spot about now. Chicken and beer,
definitly, absolutely, without a doubt.
(to Cliff)
Where's a good chicken place around here?
CLIFF
I really don't know.
CLARENCE
You don't know the chicken places around where you live?
(to Alabama)
Ask the guy at the place where a chicken place is.
He gives her some more money.
CLARENCE
This should cover it, Auggie-Doggie.
ALABAMA
Okee-dokee, Doggie-Daddy.
She opens the door and starts out. Clarence turns to his dad as the door shuts.
CLARENCE
Isn't she the sweetest goddamned girl you ever saw in your whole life? Is
she a four alarm fire, or what?
CLIFF
She seems very nice.
CLARENCE
Daddy. Nice isn't the word. Nice is an insult. She's a peach. That's the only
word for it, she's a peach. She even tastes like a peach. You can tell I'm in
love with her. You can tell by my face, can't ya? It's a dead giveaway. It's
written all over it. Ya know what? She loves me back. Take a seat, Pop, we
gotta talk ‚àö
CLIFF
Clarence, just shut up, you're giving me a headache! I can't believe how
much like your mother you are. You're your fuckin' mother through and
through. I haven't heard from ya in three years. Then ya show up all of a
sudden at eight o'clock in the morning. You walk in like a goddamn
bulldozer... don't get me wrong, I'm happy to see you... just slow it down.
Now, when did you get married?
CLARENCE
Daddy, I'm in big fuckin' trouble and I really need your help.
BLACK TITLE CARD: ""HOLLYWOOD""
INT. OUTSIDE OF CASTING DIRECTOR'S OFFICER ‚àö DAY
FOUR YOUNG ACTORS are sitting on a couch with sheets of paper in their
hands silently mouthing lines. One of the actors is DICK RITCHIE. The casting
director, MARY LOUISE RAVENCROFT, steps into the waiting room, clip
board in hand.
RAVENCROFT
Dick Ritchie?
Dick pops up from the pack.
DICK
I'm me... I mean, that's me.
RAVENCROFT
Step inside.
INT. CASTING DIRECTOR'S OFFICE ‚àö DAY
She sits behind a large desk. Her name-plate rests on the desktop. Several
posters advertising ""The Return of T.J. Hooker"" hang on the wall.
Dick sits in a chair, holding his sheets in his hands.
RAVENCROFT
Well, the part you're reading for is one of the bad guys. There's Brian and
Marty. Peter Breck's already been cast as Brian. And you're reading for
the part of Marty. Now in this scene you're both in a car and Bill Shatner's
hanging on the hood. And what you're trying to do is get him off.
(she picks a up a copy of the script)
Whenever you're ready.
DICK
(reading and miming driving)
Where'd you come from?
RAVENCROFT
(reading from the script lifelessly)
I don't know. He just appeared as magic.
DICK
(reading from script)
Well, don't just sit there, shoot him.
She puts her script down, and smiles at him.
RAVENCROFT
That was very good.
DICK
Thank you.
RAVENCROFT
If we decided on making him a New York type, could you do that?
DICK
Sure. No problem.
RAVENCROFT
Could we try it now?
DICK
Absolutely.
Dick picks up the script and begins, but this time with a Brooklyn accent.
DICK
Where'd he come from?
RAVENCROFT
(monotone, as before)
I don't know. He just appeared as magic.
DICK
Well, don't just sit there, shoot him.
Ravencroft puts her script down.
RAVENCROFT
Well, Mr. Ritchie, I'm impressed. You're a very fine actor.
Dick smiles.
INT. TRAILER HOME ‚àö DAY
Cliff's completely aghast. He just stares, unable to come to grips with what
Clarence has told him.
CLARENCE
Look, I don't know this is pretty heavy-duty, so if you wanna explode, feel
free.
CLIFF
You're always making jokes. That's what you do, isn't it? Make jokes.
Making jokes is the one thing you're good at, isn't it? But if you make a
joke about this ‚àö
(raising his voice)
‚àö I'm gonna go completely out of my fuckin' head!
Cliff pauses and collects himself.
CLIFF
What do you want from me?
CLARENCE
What?
CLIFF
Stop acting like an infant. You're here because you want me to help you in
some way. What do you need from me? You need money?
CLARENCE
Do you still have friends on the force?
CLIFF
Yes, I still have friends on the force.
CLARENCE
Could you find out if they know anythin'? I don't know they know shit
about us. But I don't wanna think, I wanna know. You could find out for
sure what's goin' on.
(pause)
Daddy?
CLIFF
What makes you think I could do that?
CLARENCE
You were a cop.
CLIFF
What makes you think I would do that?
CLARENCE
I'm your son.
CLIFF
You got it all worked out, don't you?
CLARENCE
Look, goddamnit, I never asked you for a goddamn thing! I've tried to
make your parental obligation as easy as possible. After Mom divorced
you, did I ask you for anything? When I wouldn't see ya for six months to a
year at a time, did you ever get your shit about it? No, it was always ""OK"",
""No problem"", ""You're a busy guy, I understand"". The whole time you
were a drunk, did I ever point my finger at you and talk shit? No!
Everybody else did. I never did. You see, I know that you're just a bad
parent. You're not really very good at it. But I know you love me. I'm
basically a pretty resourceful guy. If I didn't really need it I wouldn't ask.
And if you say no, don't worry about it. I'm gone. No problems.
Alabama walks in through the door carrying a shopping bag.
ALABAMA
The forager's back.
CLARENCE
Thank God. I could eat a horse if you slap enough catsup on it.
ALABAMA
I didn't get any chicken.
CLARENCE
How come?
ALABAMA
It's nine o'clock in the morning. Nothing's open.
INT. TRAILER HOME ‚àö BEDROOM ‚àö DAY
Cliff's on the telephone in his bedroom, pacing as he talks. The living room od
the trailer can be seen from his doorway, where Clarence and Alabama are
horsing around. They giggle and cut up throughout the scene. As Cliff talks, all
the noise and hubbub of a police station comes through over the line. He's
talking to DETECTIVE WILSON, an old friend of his from the force.
We see both inside the conversation.
CLIFF
It's about that pimp that was shot a couple of days ago, Drexl Spivey.
WILSON
What about him?
CLIFF
Well, Ted, to tell you the truth, I found out through the grapevine that it
might be, and I only said might be, the Drexl Spivey that was responsible
for that restaurant break-in on Riverdale.
WILSON
Are you still working security for Foster & Langley?
CLIFF
Yeah, and the restaurant's on my route. And you know, I stuck my nose in
for the company to try to put a stop to some of these break-ins. Now, while
I have no proof, the name Drexl Spivey kept comin' up Who's case is it?
WILSON
McTeague.
CLIFF
I don't know him. Is he a nice guy? You think he'll help me out?
WILSON
I don't see why not. When you gonna come round and see my new place?
CLIFF
You and Robin moved?
WILSON
Shit, are you behind. Me and Robin got a divorce six months ago. Got
myself a new place ‚àö mirrors all over the bedroom, ceiling fans above the
bed. Guy'd have to look as ugly as King Kong not to get laid in this place.
I'm serious, a guy'd have to look like a gorilla.
CUT TO:
EXT. TRAILER HOME ‚àö DAY
Clarence and Cliff stand by Clarence's 1965 red Mustang. Alabama's amusing
herself by doing cartwheels and handstands in the background.
CLIFF
They have nothing. In fact, they think it's drug related.
CLARENCE
Do tell. Why drug related?
CLIFF
Apparently, Drexl had a big toe stuck in shit like that.
CLARENCE
No shit?
CLIFF
Yeah. Drexl had an association with a fella named Blue Lou Boyle. Name
mean anything to you?
CLARENCE
Nope.
CLIFF
If you don't hang around in this circle, no reason it should.
CLARENCE
Who is he?
CLIFF
Gangster. Drug Dealer. Somebody you don't want on your ass. Look,
Clarence, the more I hear about this Drexl fucker, the more I think you did
the right thing. That guy wasn't just some wild flake.
CLARENCE
That's what I've been tellin' ya. The guy was like a mad dog. So the cops
aren't looking for me?
CLIFF
Naw, until they hear something better they'll assume Drexl and Blue Lou
had a falling out. So, once you leave twon, I wouldn't worry about it.
Clarence sticks his hand out to shake. Cliff takes it.
CLARENCE
Thanks a lot, Daddy. You really came through for me.
CLIFF
I got some money I can give you ‚àö
CLARENCE
Keep it.
CLIFF
Well, son, I want you to know I hope everything works out with you and
Alabama. I like her. I think you make a cute couple.
CLARENCE
We do make a cute couple, don't we?
CLIFF
Yeah, well, just stay outta trouble. Remeber, you got a wife to think about.
Quit fuckin' around.
(pause)
I love you son.
They hug each other,
Clarence takes a pice of paper out and puts it into Cliff's hand.
CLARENCE
This is Dick's number in Hollywood. We don't know where we'll be, but
you can get a hold of me through him.
Clarence turns toward Alabama and yells to her.
CLARENCE
Bama, we're outta here. Kiss Pops goodbye,
Alabama runs across from where she was and throws her arms around Cliff
and gives him a big smackeroo on the lips. Cliff's a little startled. Alabama's
bubbling like a Fresca.
ALABAMA
Bye, Daddy! Hope to see you again real soon.
CLARENCE
(mock anger)
What kind of daughterly smackeroo was that?
ALABAMA
Oh, hush up.
The two get into the Mustang.
CLARENCE
(to Cliff)
We'll send you a postcard as soon as we get to Hollywood.
Clarence starts the engine. The convertible roof opens as they talk.
CLIFF
Bama, you take care of that one for me. Keep him out of trouble.
ALABAMA
Don't worry, Daddy, I'm keepin' this fella on a short leash.
Clarence, slowly, starts driving away.
CLARENCE
(to Cliff)
As the sun sets slowly in the west we bid a fond farewell to all the friends
we've made... and, with a touch of melancholy, we look forward to the time
when we will all be together again.
Clarence peels out, shooting a shower of gravel up in the air.
As the Mustang disappears Cliff runs his tongue over his lips.
CLIFF
The-son-of-a-bitch was right... she does taste like a peach.
INT. DICK'S APARTMENT ‚àö DAY
Dick's apartment is standard issue for a young actor. Things are pretty neat
and clean. A nice stereo unit sits on the shelf. A framed picture of a ballet
dancer's feet hangs on the wall.
The phone rings, Dick answers.
DICK
Hi, Dick here.
INT. HOTEL SUITE ‚àö LAS VEGAS ‚àö SUNSET
Top floor, Las Vegas, Nevada hotel room with a huge picture window
overlooking the neon-filled strip and the flaming red and orange sunset sky.
Clarence paces up and down with the telephone in his hand.
CLARENCE
(big bopper voice)
Heeeellllloooo baaaabbbbbyyyy!!!
Note: We intercut both sides of the conversation.
DICK
(unsure)
Clarence?
CLARENCE
You got it.
DICK
It's great to hear from you.
CLARENCE
Well, you're gonna be seein' me shortly.
DICK
You comin' to L.A.? When?
CLARENCE
Tomorrow.
DICK
What's up? Why're leavin' Detroit?
Clarence sits down on the hotel room bed. Alabama, wearing only a long T-
shirt with a big picture of Bullwinkle on it, crawls behind him.
CLARENCE
Well, there's a story behind all that. I'll tell you when I see you. By the way,
I won't be alone. I'm bringing my wife with me.
DICK
Get the fuck outta here!
CLARENCE
I'm married man.
DICK
Get the fuck outta here!
CLARENCE
Believe it or not, I actually tricked a girl into falling in love with me. I'm
not quite sure how I did it. I'd hate to have to do it again. But I did it.
Wanna say hi to my better half?
Before Dick can respond Clarence puts Alabama on the phone.
ALABAMA
Hi, Dick. I'm Alabama Worley.
DICK
Hello, Alabama.
ALABAMA
I can't wait to meet you. Clarence told me all about you. He said you were
his best friend. So, I guess that makes you my best friend, too.
Clarence start dictating to her what to say.
CLARENCE
Tell him we gotta go.
ALABAMA
Clarence says we gotta be hittin' it.
DICK
What?
CLARENCE
Tell him we'll be hittin' his area some time tomorrow.
ALABAMA
He said don't go nowhere. We'll be there some time tomorrow.
DICK
Wait a minute ‚àö
CLARENCE
Tell him not to eat anything. We're gonna scarf when we get there.
ALABAMA
Don't eat anything.
DICK
Alabama, could you tell Clar ‚àö
CLARENCE
Ask him if he got the letter.
ALABAMA
Did you get the letter?
DICK
What letter?
ALABAMA
(to Clarence)
What letter?
CLARENCE
The letter I sent.
ALABAMA
(to Dick)
The letter he sent.
DICK
Clarence sent a letter?
CLARENCE
Has he gotten his mail today?
ALABAMA
Gotten your mail yet?
DICK
Yeah, my room-mate leaves it on the TV.
ALABAMA
(to Clarence)
Yes.
CLARENCE
Has he looked through it yet?
ALABAMA
(to Dick)
Ya looked through it?
DICK
Not yet.
ALABAMA
(to Clarence)
Nope.
CLARENCE
Tell him to look through it.
ALABAMA
(to Dick)
Get it.
DICK
Let me speak to Clarence.
ALABAMA
(to Clarence)
He wants to speak with you.
CLARENCE
No time. Gotta go. Just tell him to read the letter, the letter explains all.
Tell him I love him. And tell him, as of tomorrow, all his money problems
are over.
ALABAMA
(to Dick)
He can't. We gotta go, but he wants you to read the letter. The letter
explains it all. He wants you to know he loves you. And he wants you to
know that as of tomorrow, all of your money problems are over.
DICK
Money problems?
CLARENCE
Now tell him goodbye.
ALABAMA
Bye-bye.
CLARENCE
Now hang up.
She hangs up the phone.
INT. DICK'S APARTMENT ‚àö DAY
Dick hears the click on the other end.
DICK
Hello, hello, Clarence? Clarence's wife?... I mean Alabama... hello?
Extremely confused, Dick jangs up the phone. He goes over to the TV and picks
up the day's mail. He goes through it.
BILL: Southern California Gas Company.
BILL: Group W.
BILL: Fossenkemp Photography.
BILL: Columbia Record and Tape Club.
LETTER: It's obviously from Clarence. Addressed to Dick. Dick opens it.
EXT. TRAILER ‚àö DAY
A lower-middle-class trailer park named Astro World, which has a neon sign in
front of it in the shape of a planet.
A big, white Chevy Nova pulls into the park. It parks by a trailer that's slightly
less kept up than the others. Cliff gets out of the Chevy. He's drinking out of a
fast-food soda cup as he opens the door to his trailer.
INT. TRAILER ‚àö DAY
He steps inside the doorway and then, before he knows it, a gun is pressed to
his temple and a big hand grabs his shoulder.
GUN CARRIER (DARIO)
Welcome home, alchy. We're havin' a party.
Cliff is roughly shoved into his living room. Waiting for him are four men,
standing: VIRGIL, FRANKIE (young Wise-guy) LENNY (an old Wise-guy),
and TOOTH-PICK VIC (a fireplug pitbull type).
Sitting in Cliff's recliner is VINCENZO COCCOTTI, the Frank Nitti to Detroid
mob leader Blue Lou Boyle.
Cliff is knocked to his knees. He looks up and sees the sitting Coccotti. Dario
and Lenny pick him up and roughly drop him in a chair.
COCCOTTI
(to Frankie)
Tell Tooth-pick Vic to go outside and do you-know-what.
In Italian Frankie tells Tooth-pick Vic what Coccotti said. He nods and exits.
Cliff's chair is moved closer to Coccotti's. Dario stands on one side of Cliff.
Frankie and Lenny ransack the trailer. Virgil has a bottle of Chivas Regal in his
hand, but he has yet to touch a drop.
COCCOTTI
Do you know who I am, Mr. Worley?
CLIFF
I give up. Who are you?
COCCOTTI
I'm the Anti-Christ. You get me in a vendetta kind of mood, you will tell
the angels in heaven that you had never seen pure evil so singularly
personified as you did in the face of the man who killed you. My name is
Vincenzo Coccotti. I work as a counsel for Mr. Blue Lou Boyle, the man
your son stole from. I hear you were once a cop so I assume you've heard
of us before. Am I correct?
CLIFF
I've heard of Blue Lou Boyle.
COCCOTTI
I'm glad. Hopefully that will clear up the how-full-of-shit-I-am question
you've been asking yourself. Now, we're gonna have a little Q and A, and,
at the risk of sounding redundant, please make your answers genuine.
(taking out a pack of Chesterfields)
Want a Chesterfield?
CLIFF
No.
COCCOTTI
(as he lights up)
I have a son of my own. About you boy's age. I can imagine how painful
this must be for you. But Clarence and that bitch-whore girlfriend of his
brought this all on themselves. And I implore you not to go down the road
with 'em. You can always take comfort in the fact that you never had a
choice.
CLIFF
Look, I'd help ya if I could, but I haven't seen Clarence ‚àö
Before Cliff can finish his sentence, Coccotti slams him hard in the nose with
his fist.
COCCOTTI
Smarts, don't it? Gettin' slammed in the nose fucks you all up. You got that
pain shootin' through your brain. Your eyes fill up with water. It ain't any
kind of fun. But what I have to offer you. That's as good as it's ever gonna
get, and it won't ever get that good again. We talked to your neighbors.
They saw a Mustang, a red Mustang, Clarence's red Mustang, parked in
front of your trailer yesterday. Mr. Worley, have you seen your son?
Cliff's defeated.
CLIFF
I've seen him.
COCCOTTI
Now I can't be sure of how much of what he told you. So in the chance
you're in the dark about some of this, let me shed some light. That whore
your boy hangs around with, her pimp is an associate of mine, and I don't
just mean pimpin', in other affairs he works for me in a courier capacity.
Well, apparently, that dirty little whore found out when we're gonna do
some business, cause your son, the cowboy and his flame, came in the room
blastin' and didn't stop till they were pretty sure everybody was dead.
CLIFF
What are you talkin' about?
COCCOTTI
I'm talkin' about a massacre. They snatched my narcotics and hightailed it
outta there. Wouldda gotten away with it, but your son, fuckhead that he is,
left his driver's license in a dead guy's hand. A whore hiding in the
commode filled in all the blanks.
CLIFF
I don't believe you.
COCCOTTI
That's of minor importance. But what's of major fuckin' importance is that
I believe you. Where did they go?
CLIFF
On their honeymoon.
COCCOTTI
I'm gettin' angry askin' the same question a second time. Where did they
go?
CLIFF
They didn't tell me.
Coccotti looks at him.
CLIFF
Now, wait a minute and listen. I haven't seen Clarence in three years.
Yesterday he shows up here with a girl, sayin' he got married. He told me
he needed some quick cash for a honeymoon, so he asked if he could
borrow five hundred dollars. I wanted to help him out so I wrote out a
check. We went to breakfast and that's the last I saw of him. So help me
God. They never thought to tell me where they were goin'. And I never
thought to ask.
Coccotti looks at him for a long moment. He then gives Virgil a look. Virgil,
quick as greased lightning, grabs Cliff's hand and turns it palm up. He then
whips out a butterfly knife and slices Cliff's palm open and pours Chivas Regal
on the wound. Cliff screams.
Coccotti puffs on a Chesterfield.
Tooth-pic Vic returns to the trailer, and reports in Italian that there's nothing in
the car.
Virgil walks into the kitchen and gets a dishtowel. Cliff holds his bleeding palm
in agony. Virgil hands him the dishtowel. Cliff uses it to wrap up his hand.
COCCOTTI
Sicilians are great liars. The best in the world. I'm a Sicilian. And my old
man was the world heavyweight champion of Sicilian liars. And from
growin' up with him I learned the pantomime. Now there are seventeen
different things a guy can do when he lies to give him away. A guy has
seventeen pantomimes. A woman's got twenty, but a guy's got seventeen.
And if you know 'em like ya know your own face, they beat lie detectors to
hell. What we got here is a little game of show and tell. You don't wanna
show me nothin'. But you're tellin' me everything. Now I know you know
where they are. So tell me, before I do some damage you won't walk away
from.
The awful pain in Cliff's hand is being replaced by the awful pain in his heart.
He looks deep into Coccotti's eyes.
CLIFF
Could I have one of those Chesterfields now?
COCCOTTI
Sure.
Coccotti leans over and hands him a smoke.
CLIFF
Got a match?
Cliff reaches into his pocket and pulls out a lighter.
CLIFF
Oh, don't bother. I got one.
(he lights the cigarette)
So you're a Sicilian, huh?
COCCOTTI
(intensly)
Uh-huh.
CLIFF
You know I read a lot. Especially things that have to do with history. I find
that shit fascinating. In fact, I don't know if you know this or not, Sicilians
were spawned by niggers.
All the men stop what they were doing and look at Cliff, except for Tooth-pic
Vic who doesn't speak English and so isn't insulted. Coccotti can't believe what
he's hearing.
COCCOTTI
Come again?
CLIFF
It's a fact. Sicilians have nigger blood pumpin' through their hearts. If you
don't believe me, look it up. You see, hundreds and hundreds of years ago
the Moors conquered Sicily. And Moors are niggers. Way back then,
Sicilians were like the wops in northern Italy. Blond hair, blue eyes. But,
once the Moors moved in there, they changed the whole country. They did
so much fuckin' with the Sicilian women, they changed the blood-line for
ever, from blond hair and blue eyes to black hair and dark skin. I find it
absolutely amazing to think that to this day, hundreds of years later,
Sicilians still carry that nigger gene. I'm just quotin' history. It's a fact. It's
written. Your ancestors were niggers. Your great, great, great, great, great-
grandmother was fucked by a nigger, and had a half-nigger kid. That is a
fact. Now tell me, am I lyin'?
Coccotti looks at him for a moment then jumps up, whips out an automatic,
grabs hold of Cliff's hair, puts the barrel to his temple, and pumps three bullets
through Cliff's head.
He pushes the body violently aside. Coccotti pauses. Unable to express his
feelings and frustrated by the blood in his hands, he simply drops his weapon,
and turns to his men.
COCCOTTI
I haven't killed anybody since 1974. Goddamn his soul to burn for eternity
in fuckin' hell for makin' me spill blood on my hands! Go to this
comedian's son's apartment and come back with somethin' that tells me
where that asshole went so I can wipe this egg off of my face and fix this
fucked-up family for good.
Tooth-pick Vic taps Frankie's shoulder and, in Italianm asks him what that was
all about.
Lenny, who has been going through Cliff's refridgerator, has found a beer.
When he closes the refridgerator door he finds a note held on by a ceramic
banana magnet that says: ""Clarence in L.A.: Dick Ritchie (number and
address)"".
LENNY
Boss, get ready to get happy.

Coffee! Candy! Cake! Ice Cream!"" Rocking along the tracks every other day for four hours between Boston and New York in the coach aisles of the New York, New Haven & Hartford's ""Yankee Clipper.""
Old Man Rountree, an elderly Pullman porter and a friend of Elk's, had recommended the railroad job for me. He had told her the war was snatching away railroad men so fast that if I could pass for twenty-one, he could get me on.
Ella wanted to get me out of Boston and away from Sophia. She would have loved nothing better than to have seen me like one of those Negroes who were already thronging Roxbury in the Army's khaki and thick shoes-home on leave from boot camp. But my age of sixteen stopped that.
I went along with the railroad job for my own reasons. For a long time I'dw anted to visit New York City. Since I had been in Roxbury, I had heard a lot about ""the Big Apple,"" as it was called by the well-traveled musicians, merchant mariners, salesmen, chauffeurs for white families, and various kinds of hustlers I ran into. Even as far back as Lansing, I had been hearing about how fabulous New York was, and especially Harlem. In fact, my father had described Harlem with pride, and
showed us pictures of the huge parades by the Harlem followers of Marcus Garvey. And every time Joe Louis won a fight against a white opponent, big front-page pictures in the Negro newspapers such as the _Chicago Defender_, the _Pittsburgh Courier_, and the _Afro-American_ showed a sea of Harlem Negroes cheering and waving and the Brown Bomber waving back at them from the balcony of Harlem's Theresa Hotel. Everything I'd ever heard about New York City was exciting - things like Broadway's bright lights and the Savoy Ballroom and Apollo Theater in Harlem, where great bands played and famous songs and dance steps and Negro stars originated.
But you couldn't just pick up and goto visit New York from Lansing, or Boston, or anywhere else - not without money. So I'd never really given too much thought to getting to New York until the free way to travel there came in the form of Ella's talk with old man Rountree, who was a member of Ella's church.
What Ella didn't know, of course, was that I would continue to see Sophia. Sophia could get away only a few nights a week. She said, when I told her about the train job, that she'd get away every night I got back into Boston, and this would mean every other night, if I got the run I wanted. Sophia didn't want me to leave at all, but she believed I was draft age already, and thought the train job would keep me out of the Army. Shorty thought it would be a great chance for me. He was worried sick himself about the draft call that he knew was soon to come. Like hundreds of the black ghetto's young men, he was taking some stuff that, it was said, would make your heart sound defective to the draft board's doctors.
Shorty felt about the war the same way I and most ghetto Negroes did: ""Whitey owns everything. He wants us to go and bleed for him? Let him fight.""
Anyway, at the railroad personnel hiring office down on Dover Street, a tired-acting old white clerk got down to the crucial point, when I came to sign up. ""Age, Little?"" When I told him ""Twenty-one,"" he never lifted his eyes from his pencil. I knew I had the job.
I was promised the first available Boston-to-New York fourth-cook job. But for a while, I worked there in the Dover Street Yard, helping to load food requisitions onto the trains. Fourth cook, I knew, was just a glorified name for dishwasher, but it wouldn't be my first time, and just as long as I traveled where I wanted, it didn't make any difference to me. Temporarily though, they put me on ""The Colonial"" that ran to Washington, D.C.
The kitchen crew, headed by a West Indian chef named Duke Vaughn, worked with almost unbelievable efficiency in the cramped quarters. Against the sound of the train clacking along, the waiters were jabbering the customers' orders, the cooks operated like machines, and five hundred miles of dirty pots and dishes and silverware rattled back to me. Then, on the overnight layover, I naturally went sightseeing in downtown Washington. I was astounded to find in the nation's capital, just a few blocks from Capitol Hill, thousands of Negroes living worse than any I'd ever seen in the poorest sections of Roxbury; in dirt-floor shacks along unspeakably filthy lanes
with names like Pig Alley and Goat Alley. I had seen a lot, but never such a dense concentration of stumble bums, pushers, hookers, public crap-shooters, even little kids running around at midnight begging for pennies, half-naked and barefooted. Some of the railroad cooks and waiters had told me to be very careful, because muggings, knifings and robberies went on every night among these Negroes . . . just a few blocks from the White House.
But I saw other Negroes better off; they lived in blocks of rundown red brick houses. The old ""Colonial"" railroaders had told me about Washington having a lot of ""middle-class"" Negroes with Howard University degrees, who were working as laborers, janitors, porters, guards, taxi-drivers, and the like. For the Negro in Washington, mail-carrying was a prestige job.
After a few of the Washington runs, I snatched the chance when one day personnel said I could temporarily replace a sandwich man on the ""Yankee Clipper"" to New York. I was into my zoot suit before the first passenger got off.
The cooks took me up to Harlem in a cab. White New York passed by like a movie set, then abruptly, when we left Central Park at the upper end, at 110th Street, the people's complexion began to change.
Busy Seventh Avenue ran along in front of a place called Small's Paradise. The crew had told me before we left Boston that it was their favorite night spot in Harlem, and not to miss it. No Negro place of business had ever impressed me so much. Around the big, luxurious-looking, circular bar were thirty or forty Negroes, mostly men, drinking and talking.
I was hit first, I think, by their conservative clothes and manners. Wherever I'd seen as many as ten Boston Negroes-let alone Lansing Negroes-drinking, there had been a big noise. But with all of these Harlemites drinking and talking, there was just a low murmur of sound. Customers came and went. The bartenders knew what most of them drank and automatically fixed it. A bottle was set on the bar before some.
Every Negro I'd ever known had made a point of flashing whatever money he had. But these Harlem Negroes quietly laid a bill on the bar. They drank. They nonchalantly nodded to the bartender to pour a drink for some friend, while the bartenders, smooth as any of the customers, kept making change from the money on the bar.
Their manners seemed natural; they were not putting on any airs. I was awed. Within the first five minutes in Small's, I had left Boston and Roxbury forever.
I didn't yet know that these weren't what you might call everyday or average Harlem Negroes. Later on, even later that night, I would find out that Harlem contained hundreds of thousands of my people who were just as loud and gaudy as Negroes anywhere else. But these were the cream of the older, more mature operators in Harlem. The day's ""numbers"" business was done. The night's gambling and other forms of hustling hadn't yet begun. The usual night-life crowd, who worked on regular jobs all day, were at home eating their dinners. The hustlers at this time were in the daily six o'clock congregation, having their favorite bars all over Harlem largely to
themselves.
From Small's, I taxied over to the Apollo Theater. (I remember so well that Jay McShann's band was playing, because his vocalist was later my close friend, Walter Brown, the one who used to sing ""Hooty Hooty Blues."") From there, on the other side of 125th Street, at Seventh Avenue, I saw the big, tall, gray Theresa Hotel. It was the finest in New York City where Negroes could then stay, years before the downtown hotels would accept the black man. (The Theresa is now best
known as the place where Fidel Castro went during his U.N. visit, and achieved a psychological coup over the U.S: State Department when it confined him to Manhattan, never dreaming that he'd stay uptown in Harlem and make such an impression among the Negroes.)
The Braddock Hotel was just up 126th Street, near the Apollo's backstage entrance. I knew its bar was famous as a Negro celebrity hang-out. I walked in and saw, along that jam-packed bar, such famous stars as Dizzy Gillespie, Billy Eckstine, Billie Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald, and Dinah Washington.
As Dinah Washington was leaving with some friends, I overheard someone say she was on her way to. the Savoy Ballroom where Lionel Hampton was appearing that night-she was then Hamp's vocalist. The ballroom made the Roseland in Boston look small and shabby by comparison. And the lindy-hopping there matched the size and elegance of the place. Hampton's hard-driving outfit kept a red-hot pace with his greats such as Arnett Cobb, Illinois Jacquet, Dexter Gordon, Alvin Hayse, Joe Newman, and George Jenkins. I went a couple of rounds on the floor with girls from the sidelines.
Probably a third of the sideline booths were filled with white people, mostly just watching the Negroes dance; but some of them danced together, and, as in Boston, a few white women were with Negroes. The people kept shouting for Hamp's ""Flyin' Home,"" and finally he did it. (I could believe the story I'd heard in Boston about this number-that once in the Apollo, Hamp's ""Flyin' Home"" had made some reefer-smoking Negro in the second balcony believe he could fly, so he tried-and jumped-and broke his leg, an event later immortalized in song when Earl Hines wrote a hit tune called ""Second Balcony Jump."") I had never seen such fever-heat dancing. After a couple of slow numbers cooled the place off, they brought on Dinah Washington. When she did her ""Salty Papa Blues,"" those people just about tore the Savoy roof off. (Poor Dinah's funeral was held not long ago in Chicago. I read that over twenty thousand people viewed her body, and I should have been there myself. Poor Dinah! We became great friends, back in those days.)
But this night of my first visit was Kitchen Mechanics' Night at the Savoy, the traditional Thursday night off for domestics. I'd say there were twice as manywomen as men in there, not only kitchen workers and maids, but also war wives and defense-worker women, lonely and looking. Out in the street, when I left the ballroom, I heard a prostitute cursing bitterly that the professionals couldn't do any business because of the amateurs.
Up and down, along and between Lenox and Seventh and Eighth avenues, Harlem was like some technicolor bazaar. Hundreds of Negro soldiers and sailors, gawking and young like me, passed by. Harlem by now was officially off limits to white servicemen. There had already been some muggings and robberies, and several white servicemen had been found murdered. The police were also trying to discourage white civilians from coming uptown, but those who wanted to still did. Every man without a woman on his arm was being ""worked"" by the prostitutes. ""Baby, wanna have some fun?"" The pimps would sidle up close, stage-whispering, ""All kinds of women,
Jack-want a white woman?"" And the hustlers were merchandising: ""Hundred-dollar ring, man, diamond; ninety-dollar watch, too-look at 'em. Take 'em both for twenty-five.""
In another two years, I could have given them all lessons. But that night, I was mesmerized. This world was where I belonged. On that night I had started on my way to becoming a Harlemite. I was going to become one of the most depraved parasitical hustlers among New York's eight million people-four million of whom work, and the other four million of whom live off them.
I couldn't quite believe all that I'd heard and seen that night as I lugged my shoulder-strap sandwich box and that heavy five-gallon aluminum coffee pot up and down the aisles of the ""Yankee Clipper"" back to Boston. I wished that Ella and I had been on better terms so that I could try to describe to her how I felt. But I did talk to Shorty, urging him to at least go to see the Big Apple music world. Sophia listened to me, too. She told me that I'd never be satisfied anywhere but New York. She was so right. In one night, New York-Harlem-had just about narcotized me.
That sandwich man I'd replaced had little chance of getting his job back. I went bellowing up and down those train aisles. I sold sandwiches, coffee, candy, cake, and ice cream as fast as the railroad's commissary department could supply them. It didn't take me a week to learn that all you had to do was give white people a show and they'd buy anything you offered them. It was like popping your shoeshine rag. The dining car waiters and Pullman porters knew it too, and they faked their Uncle Tomming to get bigger tips. We were in that world of Negroes who are both servants and psychologists, aware that white people are so obsessed with their own importance that they will pay liberally, even dearly, for the impression of being catered to and entertained.
Every layover night in Harlem, I ran and explored new places. I first got a room at the Harlem YMCA, because it was less than a block from Small's Paradise. Then, I got a cheaper room at Mrs. Fisher's rooming house which was close to the YMCA. Most of the railroad men stayed at Mrs. Fisher's. I combed not only the bright-light areas, but Harlem's residential areas from best to worst, from Sugar Hill up near the Polo Grounds, where many famous celebrities lived, down to the slum blocks of old rat-trap apartment houses, just crawling with everything you could mention that was illegal and immoral. Dirt, garbage cans overflowing or kicked over; drunks, dope addicts,
beggars. Sleazy bars, store-front churches with gospels being shouted inside, ""bargain"" stores, hockshops, undertaking parlors. Greasy ""home-cooking"" restaurants, beauty shops smoky inside from Negro women's hair getting fried, barbershops advertising conk experts. Cadillacs, secondhand and new, conspicuous among the cars on the streets.
All of it was Lansing's West Side or Roxbury's South End magnified a thousand times. Little basement dance halls with ""For Rent"" signs on them. People offering you little cards advertising ""rent-raising parties."" I went to one of these-thirty or forty Negroes sweating, eating, drinking, dancing, and gamblingin a jammed, beat-up apartment, the record player going full blast, the fried chicken or chitlins with potato salad and collard greens for a dollar a plate, and cans of beer or shots of liquor for fifty cents. Negro and white canvassers sidled up alongside you, talking fast as they tried to get you to buy a copy of the _Daily Worker_: ""This paper's trying to keep your rent controlled . . . Make that greedy landlord kill them rats in your apartment . . . This paper represents the only political party that ever ran a black man for the Vice Presidency of the United States . . . Just want you to read, won't take but a little of your time . . . Who do you think fought the hardest to help free those Scottsboro boys?"" Things I overheard among Negroes when the salesmen were around let me know that the paper somehow was tied in with the Russians, but to my sterile mind in those early days, it didn't mean much; the radio broadcasts and the newspapers were then full of our-ally-Russia, a strong, muscular people, peasants, with their
backs to the wall helping America to fight Hitler and Mussolini.
But New York was heaven to me. And Harlem was Seventh Heaven! I hung around in Small's and the Braddock bar so much that the bartenders began to pour a shot of bourbon, my favorite brand of it, when they saw me walk in the door. And the steady customers in both places, the hustlers in Small's and the entertainers in the Braddock, began to call me ""Red,"" a natural enough nickname in view of my bright red conk. I now had my conk done in Boston at the shop of Abbott and
Fogey; it was the best conk shop on the East Coast, according to the musical greats who had recommended it to me.
My friends now included musicians like Duke Ellington's great drummer, Sonny Greer, and that great personality with the violin, Ray Nance. He's the one who used to stag in that wild ""scat"" style: ""Blip-blip-de-blop-de-blam-blam-"" And people like Cootie Williams, and Eddie ""Cleanhead"" Vinson, who'd kid me about his conk-he had nothing up there but skin. He was hitting the heights then with his song, ""Hey, Pretty Mama, Chunk Me In Your Big Brass Bed."" I also knew Sy Oliver;
he was married to a red-complexioned girl, and they lived up on Sugar Hill; Sy did a lot of arranging for Tommy Dorsey in those days. His most famous tune, I believe, was ""Yes, Indeed!""
The regular ""Yankee Clipper"" sandwich man, when he came back, was put on another train. He complained about seniority, but my sales record made them placate him some other way. The waiters and cooks had begun to call me ""Sandwich Red.""
By that time, they had a laughing bet going that I wasn't going to last, sales or not, because I had so rapidly become such an uncouth, wild young Negro. Profanity had become my language. I'd even curse customers, especially servicemen; I couldn't stand them. I remember that once, when some passenger complaints had gotten me a warning, and I wanted to be careful, I was working down the aisle and a big, beefy, red-faced cracker soldier got up in front of me, so drunk he was
weaving, and announced loud enough that everybody in the car heard him, ""I'm going to fight you, nigger."" I remember the tension. I laughed and told him, ""Sure, I'll fight, but you've got too many clothes on."" He had on a big Army overcoat. He took that off, and I kept laughing and said he still had on too many. I was able to keep that cracker stripping off clothes until he stood there drunk with nothing on from his pants up, and the whole car was laughing at him, and some other
soldiers got him out of the way. I went on. I never would forget that-that I couldn't have whipped that white man as badly with a club as I had with my mind.
Many of the New Haven Line's cooks and waiters still in railroad service today will remember old Pappy Cousins. He was the ""Yankee Clipper"" steward, a white man, of course, from Maine. (Negroes had been in dining car service as much as thirty and forty years, but in those days there were no Negro stewards on the New Haven Line.) Anyway, Pappy Cousins loved whiskey, and he liked everybody, even me. A lot of passenger complaints about me, Pappy had let slide. He'd ask
some of the old Negroes working with me to try and calm me down.
""Man, you can't tell him nothing!"" they'd exclaim. And they couldn't. At home in Roxbury, they would see me parading with Sophia, dressed in my wild zoot suits. Then I'd come to work, loud and wild and half-high on liquor or reefers, and I'd stay that way, jamming sandwiches at people until we got to New York. Off the train, I'd go through that Grand Central Station afternoon rush hour crowd, and many white people simply stopped in their tracks to watch me pass. The drape
and the cut of a zoot suit showed to the best advantage if you were tall-and I was over six feet. My conk was fire-red. I was really a clown, but my ignorance made me think I was ""sharp."" My knob-toed, orange-colored ""kick-up"" shoes were nothing but Florsheims, the ghetto's Cadillac of shoes in those days. (Some shoe companies made these ridiculous styles for sale only in the black ghettoes where ignorant Negroes like me would pay the big-name price for something that we associated with being rich.) And then, between Small's Paradise, the Braddock Hotel, and other places-as much as my twenty-or twenty-five-dollar pay would allow, I drank liquor, smoked marijuana, painted the Big Apple red with increasing numbers of friends, and finally in Mrs. Fisher's rooming house I got a few hours of sleep before the ""Yankee Clipper"" rolled again.
It was inevitable that I was going to be fired sooner or later. What finally finished me was an angry letter from a passenger. The conductors added their-bit, telling how many verbal complaints they'd had, and how many warnings I'd been given.
But I didn't care, because in those wartime days such jobs as I could aspire to were going begging. When the New Haven Line paid me off, I decided it would be nice to make a trip to visit my brothers and sisters in Lansing. I had accumulated some railroad free-travel privileges.
None of them back in Michigan could believe it was me. Only my oldest brother, Wilfred, wasn't there; he was away at Wilberforce University in Ohio studying a trade. But Philbert and Hilda were working in Lansing. Reginald, the one who had always looked up to me, had gotten big enough to fake his age, and he was planning soon to enter the merchant marine. Yvonne, Wesley and Robert were in school.
My conk and whole costume were so wild that I might have been taken as a man from Mars. I caused a minor automobile collision; one driver stopped to gape at me, and the driver behind bumped into him. My appearance staggered the older boys I had once envied; I'd stick out my hand, saying ""Skin me, daddy-o!"" My stories about the Big Apple, my reefers keeping me sky-high -- wherever I went, I was the life of the party. ""My man! . . . Gimme some skin!""
The only thing that brought me down to earth was the visit to the state hospital in Kalamazoo. My mother sort of half-sensed who I was.
And I looked up Shorty's mother. I knew he'd be touched by my doing that. She was an old lady, and she was glad to hear from Shorty through me. I told her that Shorty was doing fine and one day was going to be a great leader of his own band. She asked me to tell Shorty that she wished he'd write her, and send her something.
And I dropped over to Mason to see Mrs. Swerlin, the woman at the detention home who had kept me those couple of years. Her mouth flew open when shecame to the door. My sharkskin gray ""Cab Calloway"" zoot suit, the long, narrow, knob-toed shoes, and the four-inch-brimmed pearl-gray hat over my conked fire-red hair; it was just about too much for Mrs. Swerlin. She just managed to pull herself together enough to invite me in. Between the way I looked and my style of talk, I made her so nervous and uncomfortable that we were both glad when I left.
The night before I left, a dance was given in the Lincoln School gymnasium. (I've since learned that in a strange city, to find the Negroes without asking where, you just check in the phone book for a ""Lincoln School."" It's always located in the segregated black ghetto-at least it was, in those days.) I'd left Lansing unable to dance, but now I went around the gymnasium floor flinging little girls over my shoulders and hips, showing my most startling steps. Several times, the little band
nearly stopped, and nearly everybody left the floor, watching with their eyes like saucers. That night, I even signed autographs-""Harlem Red""-and I left Lansing shocked and rocked.
Back in New York, stone broke and without any means of support, I realized that the railroad was all that I actually knew anything about. So I went over to the Seaboard Line's hiring office. The railroads needed men so badly that all I had to do was tell them I had worked on the New Haven, and two days later I was on the ""Silver Meteor"" to St. Petersburg and Miami. Renting pillows and keeping the coaches clean and the white passengers happy, I made about as much as I had with
sandwiches.
I soon ran afoul of the Florida cracker who was assistant conductor. Back in New York, they told me to find another job. But that afternoon, when I walked into Small's Paradise, one of the bartenders, knowing how much I loved New York, called me aside and said that if I were wilting to quit the railroad, I might be able to replace a day waiter who was about to go into the Army.
The owner of the bar was Ed Small. He and his brother Charlie were inseparable, and I guess Harlem didn't have two more popular and respected people. They knew I was a railroad man, which, for a waiter, was the best kind of recommendation. Charlie Small was the one I actually talked with in their office. I was afraid he'd want to wait to ask some of his old-timer railroad friends for their opinion. Charlie wouldn't have gone for anybody he heard was wild. But he decided on the basis of his own impression, having seen me in his place so many times, sitting quietly, almost in awe, observing the hustling set. I told him, when he asked, that I'd never been in
trouble with the police-and up to then, that was the truth. Charlie told me their rules for employees: no lateness, no laziness, no stealing, no kind of hustling off any customers, especially men in uniform. And I was hired.
This was in 1942.I had just turned seventeen.
With Small's practically in the center of everything, waiting tables there was Seventh Heaven seven times over. Charlie Small had no need to caution me against being late; I was so anxious to be there, I'd arrive an hour early. I relieved the morning waiter. As far as he was concerned, mine was the slowest, most no-tips time of day, and sometimes he'd stick around most of that hour teaching me things, for he didn't want to see me fired.
Thanks to him, I learned very quickly dozens of little things that could really ingratiate a new waiter with the cooks and bartenders. Both of these, depending on how they liked the waiter, could make his job miserable or pleasant-and I meant to become indispensable. Inside of a week, I had succeeded with both. And the customers who had seen me among them around the bar, recognizing me now in the waiter's jacket, were pleased and surprised; and they couldn't have been more friendly. And I couldn't have been more solicitous.
""Another drink? . . . Right away, sir . . . Would you like dinner? . . . It's very good . . . Could I get you a menu, sir? . . . Well, maybe a sandwich?""
Not only the bartenders and cooks, who knew everything about everything, it seemed to me, but even the customers, also began to school me, in little conversations by the bar when I wasn't busy. Sometimes a customer would talk to me as he ate. Sometimes I'd have long talks - absorbing everything - with the real old-timers, who had been around Harlem since Negroes first came there.
That, in fact, was one of my biggest surprises: that Harlem hadn't always been a community of Negroes.
It first had been a Dutch settlement, I learned. Then began the massive waves of poor and half-starved and ragged immigrants from Europe, arriving with everything they owned in the world in bags and sacks on their backs. The Germans came first; the Dutch edged away from them, and Harlem became all German.
Then came the Irish, running from the potato famine. The Germans ran, looking down their noses at the Irish, who took over Harlem. Next, the Italians; same thing-the Irish ran from them. The Italians had Harlem when the Jews came down the gangplanks-and then the Italians left.
Today, all these same immigrants' descendants are running as hard as they can to escape the descendants of the Negroes who helped to unload the immigrant ships.
I was staggered when old-timer Harlemites told me that while this immigrant musical chairs game had been going on, Negroes had been in New York City since 1683, before any of them came, and had been ghettoed all over the city.They had first been in the Wall Street area; then they were pushed into Greenwich Village. The next shove was up to the Pennsylvania Station area. And men, the last stop before Harlem, the black ghetto was concentrated around 52nd Street, which is how 52nd Street got the Swing Street name and reputation that lasted long after the Negroes were gone.
Then, in 1910, a Negro real estate man somehow got two or three Negro families into one Jewish Harlem apartment house. The Jews flew from that house, then from that block, and more Negroes came in to fill their apartments. Then whole blocks of Jews ran, and still more Negroes came uptown, until in a short time, Harlem was like it still is today-virtually all black.
Then, early in the 1920's music and entertainment sprang up as an industry in Harlem, supported by downtown whites who poured uptown every night. It all started about the time a tough young New Orleans cornet man named Louis ""Satchmo"" Armstrong climbed off a train in New York wearing clodhopper policemen's shoes, and started playing with Fletcher Henderson. In 1925, Small's Paradise had opened with crowds all across Seventh Avenue; in 1926, the great Cotton Club, where Duke Ellington's band would play for five years; also in 1926 the Savoy Ballroom opened, a whole block front on Lenox Avenue, with a two-hundred-foot dance floor under
spotlights before two bandstands and a disappearing rear stage.
Harlem's famous image spread until it swarmed nightly with white people from all over the world. The tourist buses came there. The Cotton Club catered to whites only, and hundreds of other clubs ranging on down to cellar speakeasies catered to white people's money. Some of the best-known were Connie's Inn, the Lenox Club, Barron's, The Nest Club, Jimmy's Chicken Shack, and Minton's. The Savoy, the Golden Gate, and the Renaissance ballrooms battled for the crowds-the Savoy introduced such attractions as Thursday Kitchen Mechanics' Nights, bathing beauty contests, and a new car given away each Saturday night. They had bands from all across the country in the ballrooms and the Apollo and Lafayette theaters. They had colorful bandleaders like 'Fess Williams in his diamond-studded suit and top
hat, and Cab Calloway in his white zoot suit to end all zoots, and his wide-brimmed white hat and string tie, setting Harlem afire with ""Tiger Rag"" and ""St. James Infirmary"" and ""Minnie the Moocher.""
Blacktown crawled with white people, with pimps, prostitutes, bootleggers, with hustlers of all kinds, with colorful characters, and with police and prohibition agents. Negroes danced like they never have anywhere before or since. I guess I must have heard twenty-five of the old-timers in Small's swear to me that they had been the first to dance in the Savoy the ""Lindy Hop"" which was born there in 1927, named for Lindbergh, who had just made his flight to Paris.
Even the little cellar places with only piano space had fabulous keyboard artists such as James P.Johnson and Jelly Roll Morton, and singers such as Ethel Waters. And at four A.M., when all the legitimate clubs had to close, from all over town the white and Negro musicians would come to some prearranged Harlem after-hours spot and have thirty-and forty-piece jam sessions that would last into the next day.
When it all ended with the stock market crash in 1929, Harlem had a world reputation as America's Casbah. Small's had been a part of all that. There, I heard the old-timers reminisce about all those great times.
Every day I listened raptly to customers who felt like talking, and it all added to my education. My ears soaked it up like sponges when one of them, in a rare burst of confidence, or a little beyond his usual number of drinks, would tell me inside things about the particular form of hustling that he pursued as a way of life. I was thus schooled well, by experts in such hustles as the numbers, pimping, con games of many kinds, peddling dope, and thievery of all sorts, including armed
robbery.Embed",en,LABEL_0,0.46575865149497986,LABEL_1,0.5342413783073425

¬†¬†¬†¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†KARL MARX
This speech is a vivid expression of Marx's sense of proletarian revolution as a volcanic presence in European society of the mid-nineteenth century, and also of his intensely moralistic vision of the coming revolution as capital punishment of a society that deserved to die. He gave the speech in English on April 14, 1856, and it was published a few days later in the People's Paper. This was a Chartist paper, published in London from 1852 to 1858, for which Marx occasionally wrote articles.
¬† ¬† ¬† The so-called Revolutions of 1848 were but poor incidents-small fractures and fissures in the dry crust of European society. However, they denounced the abyss. Beneath the apparently solid surface, they betrayed oceans of liquid matter, only needing expansion to rend into fragments continents of hard rock. Noisily and confusedly they proclaimed the emancipation of the Proletarian, i.e., the secret of the nineteenth century, and of the revolution of that century. That social revolution, it is true, was no novelty invented in 1848. Steam, electricity, and the self-acting mule were revolutionists of a rather more dangerous character than even citizens Barb√©s, Raspail and Blanqui. But, although the atmosphere in which we live, weighs upon every one with a 20,000 lb. force, do you feel it? No more than European society before 1848 felt the revolutionary atmosphere enveloping and pressing it from all sides. There is one great fact, characteristic of this our nineteenth century, a fact which no party dares deny. On the one hand, there have started into life industrial and scientific forces, which no epoch of the former human history had ever suspected. On the other hand, there exist symptoms of decay, far surpassing the horrors recorded of the latter times of the Roman empire. In our days everything seems pregnant with its contrary. Machinery, gifted with the wonderful power of shortening and fructifying human labour, we behold starving and overworking it. The new-fangled sources of wealth, by some strange weird spell, are turned into sources of want. The victories of art seem bought by the loss of character. At the same pace that mankind masters nature, man seems to become enslaved to other men or to his own infamy. Even the pure light of science seems unable to shine but on the dark background of ignorance. All our invention and progress seem to result in endowing material forces with intellectual life, and in stultifying human life into a material force. This antagonism between modern industry and science on the one hand, modern misery and dissolution on the other hand; this antagonism between the productive powers, and the social relations of our epoch is a fact, palpable, overwhelming, and not to be controverted. Some parties may wail over it; others may wish to get rid of modern arts, in order to get rid of modern conflicts. Or they may imagine that so signal a progress in industry wants to be completed by as signal a regress in politics. On our part, we do not mistake the shape of the shrewd spirit that continues to mark all these contradictions. We know that to work well the newfangled forces of society, they only want to be mastered by newfangled men-and such are the working men. They are as much the invention of modern time as machinery itself. In the signs that bewilder the middle class, the aristocracy and the poor prophets of regression, we do recognise our brave friend, Robin Goodfellow,1 the old mole that can work in the earth so fast, that worthy pioneer-the Revolution . The English working men are the first born sons of modern industry. They will then, certainly, not be the last in aiding the social revolution produced by that industry, a revolution, which means the emancipation of their own class all over the world, which is as universal as capital-rule and wages-slavery. I know the heroic struggles the English working class have gone through since the middle of the last century-struggles no less glorious, because they are shrouded in obscurity, and buried by the middle class historian. To revenge the misdeeds of the ruling class, there existed in the middle ages, in Germany, a secret tribunal, called the ""Vehmgericht."" If a red cross was seen marked on a house, people knew that its owner was doomed by the ""Vehm."" All the houses of Europe are now marked with the mysterious red cross. History is the judge-its executioner, the proletarian.

¬†¬† ¬† ¬†¬† ¬† ¬†¬† ¬† ¬†¬† ¬† ¬†¬† ¬† ¬†¬† ¬† ¬†¬† ¬† ¬† FRIEDRICH ENGELS
Engels, the son of a well-to-do German manufacturer, was sent to England in 1842, at the age of twenty-two, to learn business In the office of the Ermen and Engels paper mill in the industrial city of Manchester He remained in England for nearly two years and while there gathered material for his first book, The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844, which was published in German in 1845. The extract below, from the chapter on ""The Great Towns,"" is taken from the English translation published by the Foreign Languages Publishing House, Moscow, in 1962.
¬† ¬† ¬† * * * I now proceed to describe Manchester's worker districts. First of all, there is the Old Town, which lies between the northern boundary of the commercial district and the Irk. Here the streets, even the better ones, are narrow and winding, as Todd Street, Long Millgate, Withy Grove, and Shude Hill, the houses dirty, old, and tumble-down, and the construction of the side streets utterly horrible. Going from the Old Church to Long Millgate, the stroller has at once a row of old-fashioned houses at the right, of which not one has kept its original level; these are remnants of the old pre-manufacturing Manchester, whose former inhabitants have removed with their descendants into better-built districts, and have left the houses, which were not good enough for them, to a working-class population strongly mixed with Irish blood. Here one is in an almost undisguised working-men's quarter, for even the shops and beerhouses hardly take the trouble to exhibit a trifling degree of cleanliness. But all this is nothing in comparison with the courts and lanes which lie behind, to which access can be gained only through covered passages, in which no two human beings can pass at the same time. Of the irregular cramming together of dwellings in ways which defy all rational plan, of the tangle in which they are crowded literally one upon the other, it is impossible to convey an idea. And it is not the buildings surviving from the old times of Manchester which are to blame for this; the confusion has only recently reached its height when every scrap of space left by the old way of building has been filled up and patched over until not a foot of land is left to be further occupied.
¬† ¬† ¬† To confirm my statement I have drawn here a small section of the plan of Manchester-not the worst spot and not one-tenth of the whole Old Town.
¬† ¬† ¬† This drawing will suffice to characterise the irrational manner in which the entire district was built, particularly the part near the Irk.
¬† ¬† ¬† The south bank of the Irk is here very steep and between fifteen and thirty feet high. On this declivitous hillside there are planted three rows of houses, of which the lowest rise directly out of the river, while the front walls of the highest stand on the crest of the hill in Long Millgate. Among them are mills on the river, in short, the method of construction is as crowded and disorderly here as in the lower part of Long Millgate. Right and left a multitude of covered passages lead from the main street into numerous courts, and he who turns in thither gets into a filth and disgusting grime, the equal of which is not be found-especially in the courts which lead down to the Irk, and which contain unqualifiedly the most horrible dwellings which I have yet beheld. In one of these

courts there stands directly at the entrance, at the end of the covered passage, a privy without a door, so dirty that the inhabitants can pass into and out of the court only by passing through foul pools of stagnant urine and excrement. This is the first court on the Irk above Ducie Bridge in case any one should care to look into it. Below it on the river there are several tanneries which fill the whole neighborhood with the stench of animal putrefaction. Below Ducie Bridge the only entrance to most of the houses is by means of narrow, dirty stairs and over heaps of refuse and filth. The first court below Ducie Bridge, known as Allen's Court, was in such a state at the time of the cholera that the sanitary police ordered it evacuated, swept and disinfected with chloride of lime. Dr. Kay gives a terrible description of the state of this court at that time.1 Since then, it seems to have been partially torn away and rebuilt; at least looking down from Ducie Bridge, the passer-by sees several ruined walls and heaps of d√©bris with some newer houses . The view from this bridge, mercifully concealed from mortals of small stature by a parapet as high as a man, is characteristic for the whole district. At the bottom flows, or rather stagnates, the Irk, a narrow, coal-black, foul-smelling stream, full of d√©bris and refuse, which it deposits on the shallower right bank. In dry weather, a long string of the most disgusting blackish-green slime pools are left standing on this bank, from the depths of which bubbles of miasmatic gas constantly arise and give forth a stench unendurable even on the bridge forty or fifty feet above the surface of the stream. But besides this, the stream itself is checked every few paces by high weirs, behind which slime and refuse accumulate and rot in thick masses. Above the bridge are tanneries, bonemills, and gasworks, from which all drains and refuse find their way into the Irk, which receives further the contents of all the neighbouring sewers and privies. It may be easily imagined, therefore, what sort of residue the stream deposits. Below the bridge you look upon the piles of d√©bris, the refuse, filth, and offal from the courts on the steep left bank; here each house is packed close behind its neighbour and a piece of each is visible, all black, smoky, crumbling, ancient, with broken panes and window-frames. The background is furnished by old barrack-like factory buildings. On the lower right bank stands a long row of houses and mills; the second house being a ruin without a roof, piled with d√©bris ; the third stands so low that the lowest floor is uninhabitable, and therefore without windows or doors. Here the background embraces the pauper burial-ground, the station of the Liverpool and Leeds railway, and, in the rear of this, the Workhouse, the ""Poor-Law Bastille"" of Manchester, which, like a citadel, looks threateningly down from behind its high walls and parapets on the hilltop, upon the working-people's quarter below.
¬† ¬† ¬† Above Ducie Bridge, the left bank grows more flat and the right bank steeper, but the condition of the dwellings on both banks grows worse rather than better. He who turns to the left here from the main street, Long Millgate, is lost; he wanders from one court to another, turns countless corners, passes nothing but narrow, filthy nooks and alleys, until after a few minutes he has lost all clue, and knows not whither to turn. Everywhere half or wholly ruined buildings, some of them actually uninhabited, which means a great deal here; rarely a wooden or stone floor to be seen in the houses, almost uniformly broken, ill-fitting windows and doors, and a state of filth! Everywhere heaps of d√©bris, refuse, and offal; standing pools for gutters, and a stench which alone would make it impossible for a human being in any degree civilised to live in such a district. The newly-built extension of the Leeds railway, which crosses the Irk here, has swept away some of these courts and lanes, laying others completely open to view. Immediately under the railway bridge there stands a court, the filth and horrors of which surpass all the others by far, just because it was hitherto so shut off, so secluded that the way to it could not be found without a good deal of trouble. I should never have discovered it myself, without the breaks made by the railway, though I thought I knew this whole region thoroughly. Passing along a rough bank, among stakes and washinglines, one penetrates into this chaos of small one-storied, oneroomed huts, in most of which there is no artificial floor; kitchen, living and sleeping-room all in one. In such a hole, scarcely five feet long by six broad, I found two beds-and such bedsteads and beds! -which, with a staircase and chimney-place, exactly filled the room. In several others I found absolutely nothing, while the door stood open, and the inhabitants leaned against it. Everywhere before the doors refuse and offal; that any sort of pavement lay underneath could not be seen but only felt, here and there, with the feet. This whole collection of cattle-sheds for human beings was surrounded on two sides by houses and a factory, and on the third by the river, and besides the narrow stair up the bank, a narrow doorway alone led out into another almost equally ill-built, ill-kept labyrinth of dwellings.
¬† ¬† ¬† Enough! The whole side of the Irk is built in this way, a planless, knotted chaos of houses, more or less on the verge of uninhabitableness, whose unclean interiors fully correspond with their filthy external surroundings. And how could the people be clean with no proper opportunity for satisfying the most natural and ordinary wants? Privies are so rare here that they are either filled up every day, or are too remote for most of the inhabitants to use. How can people wash when they have only the dirty Irk water at hand, while pumps and water pipes can be found in decent parts of the city alone? In truth, it cannot be charged to the account of these helots of modern society if their dwellings are not more clean than the pig sties which are here and there to be seen among them. The landlords are not ashamed to let dwellings like the six or seven cellars on the quay directly below Scotland Bridge, the floors of which stand at least two feet below the low-water level of the Irk that flows not six feet away from them; or like the upper floor of the corner-house on the opposite shore directly above the bridge, where the ground-floor, utterly uninhabitable, stands deprived of all fittings for doors and windows, a case by no means rare in this region, when this open ground-floor is used as a privy by the whole neighbourhood for want of other facilities!
¬† ¬† ¬† If we leave the Irk and penetrate once more on the opposite side from Long Millgate into the midst of the working-men's dwellings, we shall come into a somewhat newer quarter, which stretches from St. Michael's Church to Withy Grove and Shude Hill. Here there is somewhat better order. In place of the chaos of buildings, we find at least long straight lanes and alleys or courts, built according to a plan and usually square. But if, in the former case, every house was built according to caprice, here each lane and court is so built, without reference to the situation of the adjoining ones. The lanes run now in this direction, now in that, while every two minutes the wanderer gets into a blind alley, or on turning a corner, finds himself back where he started from; certainly no one who has not lived a considerable time in this labyrinth can find his way through it.
¬† ¬† ¬† If I may use the word at all in speaking of this district, the ventilation of these streets and courts is, in consequence of this confusion, quite as imperfect as in the Irk region; and if this quarter may, nevertheless, be said to have some advantage over that of the Irk, the houses being newer and the streets occasionally having gutters, nearly every house has, on the other hand, a cellar dwelling, which is rarely found in .the Irk district, by reason of the greater age and more careless construction of the houses. As for the rest, the filth, d√©bris, and offal heaps, and the pools ,in the streets are common to both quarters, and in the district now under discussion, another feature most injurious to the cleanliness of the inhabitants, is the multitude of pigs walking about in all the alleys, rooting into the offal heaps, or kept imprisoned in small pens. Here, as in most of the working-men's quarters of Manchester, the pork-raisers rent the courts and build pig-pens in them. In almost every court one or even several such pens may be found, into which the inhabitants of the court throw all refuse, and offal, whence the swine grow fat; and the atmosphere, confined on all four sides, is utterly corrupted by putrefying animal and vegetable substances. Through this quarter, a broad and measurably decent street has been cut, Millers Street, and the background has been pretty successfully concealed. But if any one should be led by curiosity to pass through one of the numerous passages which lead into the courts, he will find this piggery repeated at every twenty paces.
¬† ¬† ¬† Such is the Old Town of Manchester, and on re-reading my description, I am forced to admit that instead of being exaggerated, it is far from black enough to convey a true impression of the filth, ruin, and uninhabitableness, the defiance of all considerations of cleanliness, ventilation, and health which characterise the construction of this single district, containing at least twenty to thirty thousand inhabitants. And such a district exists in the heart of the second city of England, the first manufacturing city of the world. If any one wishes to see in how little space a human being can move, how little air-and such air!-he can breathe, how little of civilisation he may share and yet live, it is only necessary to travel hither. True, this is the Old Town, and the people of Manchester emphasise the fact whenever any one mentions to them the frightful condition of this Hell upon Earth; but what does that prove? Everything which here arouses horror and indignation is of recent origin, belongs to the industrial epoch. The couple of hundred houses, which belong to old Manchester, have been long since abandoned by their original inhabitants; the industrial epoch alone has crammed into them the swarms of workers whom they now shelter; the industrial epoch alone has built up every spot between these old houses to win a covering for the masses whom it has conjured hither from the agricultural districts and from Ireland; the industrial epoch alone enables the owners of these cattlesheds to rent them for high prices to human beings, to plunder the poverty of the workers, to undermine the health of thousands, in order that they alone, the owners, may grow rich. In the industrial epoch alone has it become possible that the worker scarcely freed from feudal servitude could be used as mere material, a mere chattel; that he must let himself be crowded into a dwelling too bad for every other, which he for his hard-earned wages buys the right to let go utterly to ruin. This manufacture has achieved, which, without these workers, this poverty, this slavery could not have lived. True, the original construction of this quarter was bad, little good could have been made out of it; but, have the landowners, has the municipality done anything to improve it when rebuilding? On the contrary, wherever a nook or comer was free, a house has been run up; where a superfluous passage remained, it has been built up; the value of land rose with the blossoming out of manufacture, and the more it rose, the more madly was the work of building up carried on, without reference to the health or comfort of the inhabitants, with sole reference to the highest possible profit on the principle that no hole is so bad but that some poor creature must take it who can pay for nothing better. However, it is the Old Town, and with this reflection the bourgeoisie is comforted. Let us see, therefore, how much better it is in the New Town.
¬† ¬† ¬† The New Town, known also as lrish Town, stretches up a hill of clay, beyond the Old Town, between the Irk and St. George's Road. Here all the features of a city are lost. Single rows of houses or groups of sheets stand, here and there, like little villages on the naked, not even grassgrown clay soil; the houses, or rather cottages, are in bad order, never repaired, filthy, with damp, unclean, cellar dwellings; the lanes are neither paved nor supplied with sewers, but harbour numerous colonies of swine penned in small sties or yards, or wandering unrestrained through the neighbourhood. The mud in the streets is so deep that there is never a chance, except in the dryest weather, of walking without sinking into it ankle deep at every step. In the vicinity of St. George' s Road, the separate groups of buildings approach each other more closely, ending in a continuation of lines, blind alleys, back lanes and courts, which grow more and more crowded and irregular the nearer they approach the heart of the town. True, they are here oftener paved or supplied with paved sidewalks and gutters; but the filth, the bad odor of the houses, and especially of the cellars, remain the same.

¬†¬† ¬†¬† ¬† ¬†¬† ¬† ¬†¬† ¬† ¬†¬† ¬† ¬†The Class Struggles in France, 1848-1850
¬†¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬†¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†KARL MARX
France opened the round of revolutions of 1848 in Europe.* The Parisian workers figured importantly in the French revolutionary events from their opening in February, when King Louis Philippe was forced to abdicate, through the June workers' insurrection, which was suppressed with great ferocity by General Cavaignac's forces. Later, the national election of December 10, 1848, brought to the French Republic's presidency Napoleon's nephew, Louis Napoleon Bonaparte, who in 1851 made himself emperor by coup d'√©tat.
.
¬† ¬† ¬† In this most mordantly brilliant of his revolutionary pamphlets, first published in 1850 as a series of articles in Neue Rheinische Zeitung, Marx not only coined such well-known phrases as ""Revolutions are the locomotives of history""; he portrayed the French workers' action as the debut of a coming Europe-wide proletarian revolution, and interspersed his narrative of France's 1848 revolution with passages of broader import that illuminate key points in his thought. These passages have been gathered together in the selection presented here.**
¬† ¬† ¬† With the exception of only a few chapters, every more important part of the annals of the revolution from 1848 to 1849 carries the heading: Defeat of the revolution!
¬† ¬† ¬† What succumbed in these defeats was not the revolution. It was the pre-revolutionary traditional appendages, results of social relationships which had not yet come to the point of sharp class antagonisms-persons, illusions, conceptions, projects from which the revolutionary party before the February Revolution was not free, from which it could be freed not by the victory of February, but only by a series of defeats.
¬† ¬† ¬† In a word: the revolution made progress, forged ahead, not by its immediate tragicomic achievements, but on the contrary by the creation of a powerful, united counter-revolution, by the creation of an opponent in combat with whom, only, the party of overthrow ripened into a really revolutionary party.
¬† ¬† ¬† To prove this is the task of the following pages.
¬†¬†¬†¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†* * *
¬† ¬† ¬† The Provisional Government which emerged from the February barricades necessarily mirrored in its composition the different parties which shared in the victory. It could not be anything but a compromise between the different classes which together had overturned the July throne, but whose interests were mutually antagonistic. The great majority of its members consisted of representatives of the bourgeoisie. The republican petty bourgeoisie was represented by Ledru-Rollin and Flocon, the republican bourgeoisie by the people from the National,1 the dynastic opposition by Cr√©mieux, Dupont de l'Eure, etc. The working class had only two representatives, Louis Blanc and Albert. Finally, Lamartine in the Provisional Government, this was at first no real interest, no definite class; this was the February Revolution itself, the common uprising with its illusions, its poetry, its visionary content and its phrases. For the rest, the spokesman of the February Revolution, by his position and his views, belonged to the bourgeoisie.
¬† ¬† ¬† If Paris, as a result of political centralisation, rules France, the workers, in moments of revolutionary earthquakes, rule Paris. The first act in the life of the Provisional Government was an attempt to escape from this overpowering influence by an appeal from intoxicated Paris to sober France. Lamartine disputed the right of the barricade fighters to proclaim a republic on the ground that only the majority of Frenchmen had that right; they must await their votes, the Paris proletariat must not besmirch its victory by a usurpation. The bourgeoisie allows the proletariat only one usurpation-that of fighting.
¬†¬†¬†¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†* * *
¬† ¬† ¬† Even the memory of the limited aims and motives which drove the bourgeoisie into the February Revolution was extinguished by the proclamation of the republic on the basis of universal suffrage. Instead of only a few factions of the bourgeoisie, all classes of French society were suddenly hurled into the orbit of political power, forced to leave the boxes, the stalls and the gallery and to act in person upon the revolutionary stage! With the constitutional monarchy vanished also the semblance of a state power independently confronting bourgeois society as well as the whole series of subordinate struggles which this semblance of power called forth!
¬† ¬† ¬† By dictating the republic to the Provisional Government and through the Provisional Government to the whole of France, the proletariat stepped into the foreground forthwith as an independent party, but at the same time challenged the whole of bourgeois France to enter the lists against it. What it won was the terrain for the fight for its revolutionary emancipation, but by no means this emancipation itself.
¬† ¬† ¬† In common with the bourgeoisie the workers had made the February Revolution, and alongside the bourgeoisie they sought to secure the advancement of their interest, just as they had installed a worker in the Provisional Government itself alongside the bourgeois majority. Organise labour! But wage labour, that is the existing, the bourgeois organisation of labour. Without it there is no capital, no bourgeoisie, no bourgeois society. A Special Ministry of Labour! But the Ministries of Finance, of Trade, of Public Works-are not these the bourgeois Ministries of Labour? And alongside these a proletarian Ministry of Labour had to be a ministry of impotence, a ministry of pious wishes, a Luxembourg Commission. Just as the workers thought they would be able to emancipate themselves side by side with the bourgeoisie, so they thought they would be able to
consummate a proletarian revolution within the national walls of France, side by side with the remaining bourgeois nations. But French relations of production are conditioned by the foreign trade of France, by her position on the world market and the laws thereof; how was France to break them without a European revolutionary war, which would strike back at the despot of the world market, England?
¬† ¬† ¬† As soon as it has risen up, a class in which the revolutionary interests of society are concentrated finds the content and the material for its revolutionary activity directly in its own situation: foes to be laid low, measures dictated by the needs of the struggle to be taken; the consequences of its own deeds drive it on. It makes no theoretical inquiries into its own task. The French working class had not attained this level; it was still incapable of accomplishing its own revolution.
¬† ¬† ¬† The development of the industrial proletariat is, in general, conditioned by the development of the industrial bourgeoisie. Only under its rule does the proletariat gain that extensive national existence which can raise its revolution to a national one, and does it itself create the modern means of production, which become just so many means of its revolutionary emancipation. Only its rule tears up the material roots of feudal society and levels the ground on which alone a proletarian revolution is possible. French industry is more developed and the French bourgeoisie more revolutionary than that of the rest of the Continent. But was not the February Revolution levelled directly against the finance aristocracy? This fact proved that the industrial bourgeoisie did not rule France. The industrial bourgeoisie can rule only where modern industry shapes all property relations to suit itself, and industry can win this power only where it has conquered the world market, for national bounds are inadequate for its development. But French industry, to a great extent, maintains its command even of the national market only through a more or less modified system of prohibitive duties. While, therefore, the French proletariat, at the moment of a revolution, possesses in Paris actual power and influence which spur it on to a drive beyond its means, in the rest of France it is crowded into separate, scattered industrial centres, being almost lost in the superior numbers of peasants and petty bourgeois. The struggle against capital in its developed, modern form, in its decisive aspect, the struggle of the industrial wage worker against the industrial bourgeois, is in France a partial phenomenon, which after the February days could so much the less supply the national content of the revolution, since the struggle against capital's secondary modes of exploitation, that of the peasant against usury and mortgages or of the petty bourgeois against the wholesale dealer, banker and manufacturer, in a word, against bankruptcy, was still hidden in the general uprising against the finance aristocracy.
¬†¬†¬†¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†* * *
¬† ¬† ¬† Thus in the approaching m√™l√©e between bourgeoisie and proletariat, all the advantages, all the decisive posts, all the middle strata of society were in the hands of the bourgeoisie, at the same time as the waves of the February Revolution rose high over the whole Continent and each new post brought a new bulletin of revolution, now from Italy, now from Germany, now from the remotest parts of South Eastern Europe, and maintained the general ecstasy of the people, giving it constant testimony of a victory that it had already forfeited.
¬†¬†¬†¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†* * *
¬† ¬† ¬† The workers were left no choice; they had to starve or let fly. They answered on June 22 with the tremendous insurrection in which the first great battle was fought between the two classes that split modern society. It was a fight for the preservation or annihilation of the bourgeois order. The veil that shrouded the republic was torn asunder.
¬† ¬† ¬† It is well known how the workers, with unexampled bravery and ingenuity, without leaders, without a common plan, without means and, for the most part, lacking weapons, held in check for five days the army, the Mobile Guard, the Paris National Guard and the National Guard that streamed in from the provinces. It is well known how the bourgeoisie compensated itself for the mortal anguish it suffered by unheard of brutality, massacring over 3,000 prisoners.
¬†¬†¬†¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†* * *
¬† ¬† ¬† The official representatives of French democracy were steeped in republican ideology to such an extent that it was only some weeks later that they began to have an inkling of the significance of the June fight. They were stupefied by the gunpower smoke in which their fantastic republic dissolved.
¬† ¬† ¬† The Paris proletariat was forced into the June insurrection by the bourgeoisie. This sufficed to mark its doom. Its immediate, avowed needs did not drive it to engage in a light for the forcible overthrow of the bourgeoisie, nor was it equal to this task. The Moniteur had to inform it officially that the time was past when the republic saw any occasion to bow and scrape to its illusions, and only its defeat convinced it of the truth that the sl",en,LABEL_0,0.442728191614151,LABEL_1,0.5572717785835266

There's a moon over Bourbon Street tonight
I see faces as they pass
Beneath the pale lamplight
I've no choice but to follow that call
The bright lights, the people
And the moon and all
I pray everyday to be strong
For I know what I do must be wrong

Oh you'll never see my shade
Or hear the sound of my feet
While there's a moon over Bourbon Street

It was many years ago
That I became what I am
I was trapped in this life
Like an innocent lamb
Now I can never show my face at noon
And you'll only see me walking
By the light of the moon
The brim of my hat
Hides the eye of a beast
I've the face of a sinner
But the hands of a priest

Oh you'll never see my shade

While there's a moon over Bourbon Street

She walks everyday through
The streets of New Orleans
She's innocent and young
From a family of means
I have stood many times
Outside her window at night
To struggle with my instinct
In the pale moon light
How could I be this way
When I pray to god above
I must love what I destroy
And destroy the thing I love

Oh you'll never see my shade

Trey dad's a tough guy, slight chubby, but still a buff guy
Jack boy' run on 'em and then he snuffed, guy
So, one day, he took Trey with him and he got shot

Eagle scout, I'm with a fresh ""I don't give a fuck"" badge
Scru wrangled and awaken the rattlesnake in your face
The unmistakable battle cat, ha! So say my catchphrase louder, who's next?

Coming in, I know there's people who laugh
When I'm dropping my bars, I don't act like the part
But I'm leaving them charred like a flow Avatar
When I say that I'm terrible, mean like the tzar
Paladin, radiance in my battling
Staying sick like a pathogen
Taking risks like I'm Catherine
Work non-stop like I'm Hamilton
Watch 'em DDoS and eavesdrop
To screenshots for cheap shots
And scream lot when we got
What they've always dreamed of
So keep up and prove what
You've got- Russell's teapot
Bring thunder like Zeus
My rhymes buff like a Greek God
Plan like I'm Bonaparte, honing art
Keeping afloat like I'm Noah's ark
Smart like I'm Tony Stark, look at my coat of arms
When I've been spitting, you better be fitting the smoke alarms
They say I wrote it wrong
I can explain to you lyrics and smiles using a flow chart
No faux pas
Making these symphonies, Mozart
Stay getting views, thousands? No, try millions
Y'all saying nothing like streams from Sky Williams
I'm staying hungry, I ain't making no food waste
A new ace, leave reactors twisted, call it screw face

(Ooh, who's that?) It's the coo-coo lad who produced the track
You few assume he wack, but computer hack; I just use the MAC
Shots flew through you but, dude, you'd be truly ass if you shooting gats
It's like your boo, no cap, I get booty claps 'til I come on back
Matter fact, let me flip quick - no acrobat, jail wanna keep me in a trap so bad
12 wanna see me laid flat on back, then you wanna talk crap? Let's chat
Doubled if the cops get us capped, bring up stats
Why every time we ask for that they talk about crime that's black on black?
Man, let's keep it real, crime is crime, so wherever you are that is who you get killed by
Racism undercover as classism, this about dollar bills, yikes!
No, this ain't what the feds like, this that talk that get me dead, right?
I'm just doing what they said, write? Hope my community read lines
Yeah, they been reading what I got
Better than treating popular heathens like we all need them, they ain't gods
Yet again, we've been checking a screen for validation till we cry
Instead of believing in a lot, we proceed to idol lies (Skoodwidit!)

Look, haha... look...

I know spots where they tote Yops when they mean war
And I mean war, not H3 versus Keemstar
It seems y'all forgot that my temper's hot and it seesaws
Been leeched on for so damn long, nigga, we need ours
I'll heat y'all frame up and take my aim 'fore I seat y'all
My utensils were stainless, and for a plate, I would eat y'all
You se√±oritas, you sub-tweeters are margaritas
9 millimeters holds sixteen, Chris Delia
Yo, it's evident when it comes to this shit, I'm just ahead of them
Look, I'm on my second win
While they're catching their second wind
Well that just means I'm better than they sedative, I'm medicine
They got them toilet bars, same shit, but just a better spin
YouTube's Thomas Edison
If I create the light- they gon' use it and then they'll credit them
But I was made to fight and my movement ain't made of Gelatin
And now I'm taking flight 'cause I'm proving that I can get it, the truest is what they never been, uh!
They got me stressed, so I hit the Sess till I hit the Stinger
It's Twitter fingers till niggas mailing out niggas fingers
Niggas singers, Diana Ross, till they die on the floor
Nigga, you can die on a cross tryna fight with the gods
I'm Leonidas when I'm fighting, a Titan of sorts
Why you lying? You can't beat the game till you fight with the boss
Think we chummy till this .40 in they 20/20
Embarrass these rapping parodies buried 'cause now we coming

Bitch!
Hahahahaha...

Thank you. Thank you very much! Thank you. Thanks. I appreciate that. Thank you so much. Take a seat. Take a seat. Thanks so much. Wow. What a nice welcome. Wow, wow, wow. Very excit-- By the way, this guy's with me. He's, uh... he's authorized. He's not, like, a very audacious bootlegg–µr who really doesn't give a fuck. ""You said no phon–µs, but what about full-on cameras?"" Uh... Yeah, we're filming these shows, so, you know, you might be in the show, uh, when it's on, whatever I put it on. You'll be like, ""Oh, shit. I was there!"" But we're filming a few shows, so if you're, like, the shitty crowd, we won't use any of the footage. Um... I'm psyched to be here. I-I've been on the road for a while. Um, I just got back to New York, uh, my home, uh, a few days ago, and, uh, yeah. I, uh... I was walking around the other day, and this guy, uh, came up to me on the street, and he was like, uh, ""Hey, man. Love the Netflix show!"" And I was like, ""Oh, thanks so much."" He was like, ""Yeah, yeah, I really liked the episode you did on Supreme!"" I was like, ""What? I didn't do no episode on Supreme."" And then I quickly realized he's talking about Hasan Minhaj. Patriot Act. Different show. Different guy. And he felt horrible, right? He immediately realized his mistake, and he was trying to buy it back. He was like, ""Oh, no, no, Aziz, right?"" I was like, ""Yeah, yeah. That's me."" ""Master of None!"" ""Yeah, yeah. That's me."" ""Parks and Rec."" ""Yeah, yeah. That's me."" ""Treat yo' self."" ""Yeah, yeah. That's me."" ""And, uh, you had that whole thing last year, sexual misconduct?"" ""No, no, no, no, no! That was Hasan."" You know, I... I haven't said much about that whole thing, um, but I've talked about it on this tour, 'cause you're here, and it means a lot to me. And I'm sure some of you are curious how I feel about that whole situation. And, uh, it's a tricky thing for me to answer, 'cause I've felt so many things in the last year, so... There's times I felt scared. There's times I felt humiliated. There's times I felt embarrassed. And ultimately, I just felt terrible that this person felt this way. And after a year or so, I just hope it was a step forward. It moved things forward for me and made me think about a lot. I hope I've become a better person. And I always think about a conversation I had with one of my friends where he was like, ""You know what, man? That whole thing made me think about every date I've ever been on."" And I thought, ""Wow. Well, that's pretty incredible. It's made not just me, but other people be more thoughtful, and that's a good thing."" And that's how I feel about it. And I know... this isn't the most hilarious way to begin a comedy show. But it's important to me that you know how I feel about that whole thing before we share this night together. Well, that was pretty intense. What else shall we talk about? America? Everyone's very worried right now. A lot of people are bummed. People are like, ""Oh, my God. Shit has hit the fan."" I'm not worried, though. You know why? 'Cause... this is America, okay? Shit didn't hit the fan, shit's always been on the fan, okay? There's never been a clean fan out there. There's always been shit up there. Every generation of Americans has had their shit. And they've persevered, and we will as well, okay? And some of those generations have had even crazier shit than we do, right? Things like the Depression, Vietnam, the draft... Could you imagine if we had a draft? With today's people? ""Uh, I can't go to war. I just started this company. We make eco-friendly shoes out of cashews. They're called ""Cashoes"". Just a few generations before, they'd give that guy a rifle, they're like, ""Go shoot some Asian people!"" Now he's at work like, ""Uh, it's not pronounced 'pho', Valerie, it's 'faa.'"" His grandfather... But I promise you, we're gonna be okay, 'cause despite how it may seem, we still have a capacity for listening, for understanding. I'll give you an example, okay? There was a story I read. This girl goes to her high school prom. White girl. She wears an Asian garment. And there's an Asian kid at the school and he's offended. He actually did something really cool. He actually went up to her and they had a conversation. He explained his concerns about cultural appropriation. She assured him she was coming from a place of respect and admiration. And they both learned about each other's perspectives. And it was a really-- Just kidding. None of that shit happened. Oh! Why would that happen? No, he just Tweeted out her pictures and wrote, ""My culture's not your goddamn prom dress!"" And this became global news! And there was articles, and comments, and tweets. And I read all of 'em. And my favorite thing is you go on these threads, and you'd see people arguing, trying to, like, out-woke each other. You know what I mean? Like, one person'd be like, ""Oh, I can't believe she'd just steal from Chinese culture like that."" Another guy'd be like, ""Actually, the Chinese stole that from Malaysia."" And I was like, ""Oh, shit! You just got out-woked! You thought your eyes were open. This other dude doesn't even have a forehead. His eyeball just keeps going... just so he can see all the injustice."" Man, look, man. I saw the pictures. It didn't seem like this person's heart was in the wrong place. It's not like she tweeted, ""Hey, everybody, check out my ching-chong, bing-bong dress!"" Well, that would be bad. Do I not have all the facts? Did she step out of the limo like... ""Konichiwa, bitches! Where's the prom?"" All right, that's problematic. Nowadays, man, sometimes even when the stuff is racist, I'm like, ""Can we just talk about something else? I don't think we're gonna fix it at this brunch. I don't think this is the crew that's gonna crack the case."" Say what you will about racist people, but they're usually very brief. Newly woke white people are exhausting! ""Uh, what's the statistic? Where'd you read the article?"" Chin, chin, chin, chin, cha. ""Aziz, have you seen this episode of The Simpsons? There's an Indian character and dabu do dabee dabade dabado."" ‚ô™ Think piece, stink piece I just read a think piece ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Now I'm gonna say what I read to you ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Here are the bullet points For this issue ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Badoo-badoo, badoo-badoo badoo-badoo, ba-doo-doo ‚ô™ Oh, can you just call me Apu and leave me alone? Yeah! I'm aware. I'm aware, Candice. I saw it years ago. It's a white guy doing an Indian voice. I appreciate the support, but things don't just become racist when white people figure it out. Don't get me wrong, I don't like those Simpsons people either. They're running around, ""Why did no one say anything years ago? We're winning awards and stuff, no one said anything."" 'Cause Indian people could only say something, like, four years ago, okay? We've had a slow rise in the culture. You know who the first Indian person I saw on MTV was? Me! It's taken a minute. All right, truth be told, it was that bass player in No Doubt, but, you know... He was in the background playing bass! He didn't have a platform to speak on these things! Plus, we all know the dynamic in that band. ""Uh, Gwen, there's a couple of issues in the Indian-American community and--"" ‚ô™ Don't speak! ‚ô™ ""Okay, shit, I'm sorry."" Interesting times for, uh, white people. Uh... I've been observing you. I see what's going on. You're trying really hard to be nice to minorities... in a way I've never seen before. Putting in the time, putting in the effort. Getting out there. Watching Crazy Rich Asians. White people went in droves. Very cool. Any white people here see Crazy Rich Asians? Raise your hands, everybody. Yeah? Yeah. You, man, in the front. You saw it? Yeah? It had, like, a %on Rotten Tomatoes. You think it was that good, %? Eh, maybe a little less? What-- what number would you give it? Eighty-five. Eighty-five? Wow! Twelve percent less. Anything in particular you didn't like that made you dock it points, man? Are you nervous right now? I'm just messing with you. It doesn't matter what you think about the movie. It's just fun to make white people feel bad. And... This is so adorable. Look how far we've come... ...in just two generations, right? Like, your grandma doesn't even call that movie ""Crazy Rich Asians."" She calls it ""that movie that has too many Orientals."" And now you're sitting here like, ""Uh, ? Shit. I take it back, . What do I need to say to not get in trouble? Uh..."" It's coming from a good place, but some people are acting weird, man. I asked this one lady, I was like, ""You see Crazy Rich Asians?"" She was like, ""Yeah!"" I was like, ""You like it?"" She was like, ""Uh, I actually didn't see it, I'm sorry!"" I'm like... ""What are you lying for?! What did you think, I was gonna give you some cookies?"" My favorite thing, though, one time I asked someone, I was like, uh, ""You like Crazy Rich Asians?"" They're like, ""You know what, Aziz? I'm gonna be honest with you. The first time I saw it, I didn't really enjoy it. But then I watched it again with one of my Asian friends, and I saw how much it meant to her to see herself represented on the screen, and that made me really like the film."" And I said, ""Oh, um, that doesn't mean you like the movie, that's just a weird, condescending, shitty thing to say."" Could you imagine - Mall Cop... ...and I was like, ""I didn't really like it, but then I watched it again with one of my chubby white friends... Really changed my perspective."" Oh. But, look, I'll give credit where credit's due. I've been around years. I've never seen white people trying this hard be nice to minorities. I know there's some people that are not trying at all, and some people going a bit aggressively the other direction... But overall, I'd say this edition of white people is trying the hardest. And I think it's cool, and I appreciate it. But... sometimes I'm a little suspicious. Uh, minorities, you know what I'm talking about? Doesn't it seem a little weird sometimes? Doesn't it seem a little strange? Almost like some people are playing a game where they're, like, tallying up points for doing nice stuff. Like, is there some sort of secret, progressive Candy Crush we don't know about? Like, don't you imagine some white people getting together in secret, like, ""All right, let's tally up our scores. What did everyone do for equality today?"" Let's hear it. Brian, tell us about your day."" ""Well, I told one of my African-American friends I thought Black Panther should have won Best Picture. Then I tweeted out some support for this new documentary by a lesbian filmmaker. Then I Instagrammed a little love for Colin Kaepernick. Then I crossed the street when I saw a black guy. Shit! I need more points. I need more points. What can I do? Wrote a lengthy Instagram post calling myself out for white privilege based on something I did in ."" Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding! ""Tell him what he's won, guys!"" ""Oh, Brian's won a bunch of Instagram likes from other white people playing the same game!"" And look, I know there's some people sitting here like, ""Come on, Aziz. What the hell? I'm white. I don't do this shit, okay? I'm here, watching you, supporting minorities in the arts!"" It's a weird time to be working on jokes. Gotta be very careful about what you say, right? I've seen people in regular jobs getting in trouble these days, you know? I recently saw some people got in trouble for, uh, saying the word ""niggardly."" Which, take it easy, has nothing to do with race. It just means cheap or stingy. You can look up the etymology, it's a completely innocent word. And people are getting in trouble for it. Which is crazy. But... it seems like they could've just said cheap or stingy, right? I don't know why they had to walk the plank on this one. ""Mmm... I know what it sounds like. But I want to use my big word! What do you mean you're getting a regular ticket? Let's get a Fast Pass. Quit being so niggardly!"" One of the guys that got in trouble, he's a senator from Ohio, right? His name's Sherrod Brown. They had a meeting about military spending. And he goes to the legislators, ""You all, when it comes to spending on the weapons and the wars, you all want to spend very lavishly, but when the veterans come home, you start acting very niggardly."" They're like, ""Uh, what'd you say?"" ""I said, 'You just start acting very niggardly.'"" ""Uh, just the last word again, Sherrod?"" ""I said, 'Niggardly.'"" ""Get him out of here!"" And he got in all this trouble. And then, they looked it up in the dictionary, and he was fine. But when I first read the article, I was really confused, 'cause I read his name as Sherrod Brown, and I was like, ""Uh, seems like Sherrod Brown should be okay here, right? Am I missing something here, Sherrod Brown? Do I not have all the facts? Uh... Oh, he's a white guy? Get him out of here!"" No. It's a completely innocent word. Nothing wrong with it. So, you know, white dude in the front, if you want to put it in rotation every now and then, go for it. Nothing wrong with it. I just explained to you, there's nothing wrong with the word, right? Right? You got it. So, why don't you just yell it into the microphone right now? Okay, here we go, let's do it. Here we go. Let's go. Here we go. Let's go, let's go. Here we go. He was about to do it! Can you believe it, guys? Come on, sir! That's not cool. That was a test and you failed! You can't just throw it around willy-nilly. Maybe if it comes up in your life organically, then you can consider throwing it in. I don't know what the scenario is, maybe, uh... Maybe go out to dinner with your African-American boss, right? And... he grabs the bill, and then you look at the tip. You're like, ""Mm, I don't know, sir, seems a bit niggardly."" Like, that... seems okay. Gotta be careful about what you say. And about what you said, right? 'Cause they'll dig up the old tweets. They'll find the old clips. You know what's strange about that whole thing, though? Is like... you ever just watch very popular mainstream stuff from not that long ago? Uh, there's stuff in there, guys! I was watching The Hangover the other day. This is one of the biggest movies ever, right? It's not that old. There's a scene in that movie where Bradley Cooper goes, ""Paging Dr. Faggot!"" That's in the movie! Did you guys write a letter? I didn't write a letter. Not only is it in the movie, it's in the trailer for the movie! You know why it was in the trailer? 'Cause they did test readings, and whenever Bradley Cooper went, ""Paging Dr. Faggot,"" everyone went, ""Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! This movie rules! I love that word!"" You can watch stuff that's not that old with eyes and things can seem weird now. Like... like, I was watching a... a rerun of The Office. What's the biggest story? ""Jim and Pam. Oh, I hope they get together!"" You watch it now, though, it's like, ""Mmh, I don't know. This lady's engaged. He's been hitting on her for, like, four seasons. I don't know if this is cool in the workplace. If they rebooted The Office now, it'd end with Pam winning a landmark sexual harassment case. And then, in the series finale, you'd find out that's what the documentary was, they were just gathering evidence against Jim! I was even watching my own show. I was watching a Parks and Rec rerun. I love Parks, love my Parks family. But I was watching some season's rerun, and I was like, ""Eee, I don't know. Like, we had a whole scene in the show where my character Tom gets a gift for Rashida Jones's character. Right? I get her a teddy bear. But the teddy bear has a nanny cam in it. Nuh... I feel like if I got script today, I'd be like, ""Mmh, yeah, I'm not doing this one, guys. Pretty sure Tom would go to jail for that."" But back then, I was like, ""Oh, I get it. Now I can see inside her house. Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha."" But that's very interesting. What does that mean? Does that mean me and the people that made Parks are bad people? No. It was a different cultural context. You can't judge everything by standards. Sure, some things, of course, but not everything. Yeah? I guess what I'm saying is, ""Look, we're all shitty people, okay? And we have our blind spots. And we become aware, and we slowly get better. We're all on a journey. And if you're sitting there, like, ""I'm not shitty. I'm aware of all the marginalized groups."" You're extra shitty, okay? 'Cause you're arrogant. Have some humility. Don't you realize in years we're all gonna look back and feel like complete assholes? Like, isn't that the dream, in a way? That years from now, we look back, we can't even justify ourselves to our grandkids. We're just sitting there like, ""Uh, yeah. I don't know what the fuck was going on. Um... There was just homeless people everywhere and no-one gave a shit. Uh... You'd just kind of avoid eye contact, walk around 'em, hope it wasn't one of the ones that'd chase you down. Every now and then they'd have cups out and you'd open up your wallet and be like, ""Uh, sorry, all I got's twenties."" And then you'd hop on one of those weird scooters and get the fuck out of there! It was a weird time, . We put every single black guy in jail. Every single black guy was in jail, except for, like, Drake, LeVar Burton, and that little kid from Stranger Things. Besides them, we put every single black guy in jail for, like, a little bit of weed. And then we made weed legal and we just left 'em in there. I don't know, it seems like we could have made a couple of calls. Cultural context, right, could change everything. Look at all this R. Kelly stuff. All this information was out there in the past, right? There was the Aaliyah thing, there were the tapes, and everyone just kind of looked the other way, right? But now, the culture has reached a breaking point. Now that there's a bingeable six hour documentary, the culture's like, ""Hey, it's one thing for all this information to be out there in a -page long read, but now that it's been packaged in an entertaining fashion, no more!"" I watched it. Intense. Just out of curiosity, you guys, clap if you're done with R. Kelly. Clap if you're done with R. Kelly. Yeah. Wow. A lot of people. Yeah. I mean, it was a very compelling piece. A lot of people putting out statements and stuff now. People that used to work with him. People like Lady Gaga, Chance the Rapper. You know who I haven't seen a statement from? This guy right here. Nothing from you, sir! - Sir, what's your name up here? - Dan. - Dan, what's your last name? - Greenblatt. Dan Greenblatt. I've seen nothing from Dan Greenblatt. But why would I, Dan? There's no documentation of your R. Kelly patronage, right? You're very lucky in that regard. Wouldn't that be embarrassing? What if you were watching that documentary, right, and they're like, ""Oh, and then the tape comes out"" At this point, you've got to know something's not right. But people didn't care. Here's footage of Dan Greenblatt just one week after the tape was released. ‚ô™ It's a remix to ignition I got them fresh out of the kitchen ‚ô™ ‚ô™ I got the rollin'-- ‚ô™ Here's footage of Dan just two weeks later, driving to work. ‚ô™ I'm sippin' on Coke and rum ‚ô™ ‚ô™ I'm like, ""So, what? I'm drunk"" It's the rar, rar, rar, rar"" ‚ô™ You're lucky they don't have that footage, Dan. You know you got down to those tunes. Wouldn't that be so awful? What if they had footage of you from, like, years ago? Maybe, uh, you know, talking about going to an R. Kelly concert. Talking about how you had a great time and how it was so silly. Wouldn't that be awful? You know who they do have footage of like that? Me! Yeah, it's the end of my first stand-up special. I put it out myself. I had this whole bit at the end of my first stand-up special. I'm like, ""I went to an R. Kelly concert. It was crazy!"" I don't do that shit now, but it's still out there. And I'm watching this documentary, I'm terrified! I'm like, ""Man, they'd better not pull up them clips! I've had a tricky year as it is."" 'Cause... I listened to it the other day, guys, and the bit has not aged well. Like, all the wording I used is the worst possible wording. And I'm imagining Wendy Williams or whoever going to one of these clubs where I'm on stage like, ""You know, guys, my favorite musician I've ever met is R. Kelly!"" ""His favorite musician he's ever met... is R. Kelly. And it doesn't end there. Let's look at a clip from Aziz's second stand-up special, which came out just two years later."" ""You know, guys, in my last special, I talked about R. Kelly. And I figured I don't need to do that this time, but here's the problem, R. Kelly keeps doing amazing things! Amazing things! Amazing things! Amazing things! Amazing things!"" You know what's weird is I was watching that special, and there was a lot of jokes on there I'd forgotten. It was, like, ten years old, you know? There was bits, I was like, ""Ooh, I don't know if I'd say that today."" I felt bad. Then I was like, ""Eh, that's fine."" That's the way it's supposed to be, right? If you're the same person you were ten years ago, you're shitty! Like, you're supposed to change. But there was jokes on there, like, I wouldn't do that now, you know? Like, I had this old bit where I used to talk about my little cousin Harris, and, uh... Yeah, yeah, thank you, whatever. And, uh... I-I had this joke in there where I would talk about how he watched weird TV shows and how he's a little chubby. I had one bit where I was like, ""Know what? There's not a lot of chubby Indian kids! It's kind of a rarity. It's kind of like seeing a shooting star, only it's fat, brown, and on the ground."" It's fine, whatever, but I feel like if I had thought of that joke today, I'd be like, ""Uh, probably no reason to fat shame my little cousin on a global scale. Maybe I'll tuck that one aside."" But back then, I was . I was like, ""I've got to fill this hour, I don't give a shit!"" I just threw little Harris under the bus. Well, he is a little chubby, so, technically, I squeezed him in, right? He's fine. He got internships and stuff 'cause of that bit. Yeah! People were like, ""What? You're that Harris?"" And he's not chubby no more. He's like super buff. He goes to gym all the time. Probably 'cause he was scarred for life. ""I'm not a shooting star! I'm not a shooting star!"" I watched that, uh... I watched that Michael Jackson documentary. Ooh, I don't know if you had a chance to see this one, but let's just say hypothetically you did and you're equally as convinced as you are about R. Kelly. Clap if you're done with Michael Jackson. Clap if you're done. What happened to all them R. Kelly claps? That was way less people. You guys are all collectively like, ""Uh, I don't know what to tell you, Aziz. The music's way better. Sorry, I... I'll take the hit on Kells, but Michael is a bridge I'm not willing to cross. I got a wedding next month, let's be serious!"" Dan, nothing from you? Dan's like, ""I heard it's, like, two kids. I don't give a shit. Sorry, Aziz, I'm going home, I'm listening to ""Thriller,"" I'm watching The Cosby Show and going to bed. Deal with it!"" All right. But, Dan. Okay. Let's say... let's say another doc comes out. Now it's worse. Now they're saying it's, like, a thousand kids. Now are you done with Michael Jackson? Yeah. See? Dan is a man of principle, okay? He was like, ""Two kids are one thing, but I got to draw the line somewhere, and Dan's gonna draw the line at a thousand kids!"" Isn't it weird we're just watching this stuff as entertainment? Right? Isn't that kind of strange? Your friends were like, ""Oh, man. Have you seen that show where those two guys graphically describe being molested for four hours?"" ""No."" ""You gotta watch it!"" I don't know what went down, but I will say that it did seem like something weird was happening and that Michael was kind of a sick guy. And I wish the people around him had done more to get him help. You know? Like... like, he would bring these kids on tour and stuff. I've been on tour. I know what it's like. There are plenty of other people around. I got a tour manager, I got opening comedians, I got the venue staff. I feel like if I showed up on a Friday and I was like, ""Hey, guys. This is Justin. He's gonna be with me all week."" ""Um... Aziz, Justin's six."" ""But he's my friend."" ""Um... Maybe you need some friends your own age."" ""Uh, but I didn't have a childhood. I'm Peter Pan."" ""No, you might be a pedophile. Come on Justin. Let's get you to your parents. Have a talk with your mom about her priorities."" Stand up for a second. I don't know this kid. You could have played Justin. This is my friend Justin. He's gonna be with me all week. Why the fuck are you sitting in the front row of this show? What was that, dad and two sons? Well, uh... you know... If that ends up in a special, mom is not gonna be pleased. ""Way to go, Dad!"" What is your name? I'm Tyler. - Tyler. And the other kid's name? - I'm Dylan. Dylan. Tyler and Dylan. Okay. How old are you, Tyler? - Ten. - Ten? Oh, shit! Perfectly cast! Jesus. What's your name, Dad? - Uh, Ben. - Ben, okay. You made an awkward decision bringing these kids. You know, the other thing that's tricky about the Michael thing is I don't know what to think 'cause I have the internet, and the internet can confirm anything you want to believe, right? You know, I can go on there, I can type ""Michael Jackson guilty."" And I'll be like, ""What? Michael is a monster. I can't believe he'd do that."" But then, I can go on there, I can go on YouTube and type ""Michael Jackson innocent,"" and be like, ""What? Those kids set him up!"" I don't know what to believe, 'cause a YouTube video can convince you of anything! I watched a YouTube video once, I was like, ""Whoa, am I in the Illuminati? Like... This is some compelling evidence they've put together."" I watched this video, it's like, ""Aziz Ansari: illuminati. Look at his name. How does he spell it? Two As. What do As have on the top of them? Triangles. Two triangles. What else does he have in his name? Two Is. A-Z-I-Z, A-N-S-A-R-I. Two Is, two triangles. What does he have in his head? Two eyes. illuminati."" If Michael did do this stuff, it's created, you know, a weird cultural conundrum for us. You know. 'Cause, you know, music's very visceral. It becomes a part of your life. You know, my first memory of music itself, is when I was probably not that much younger than Tyler. And I remember... ...listening to a Michael Jackson cassette, to Thriller. That was my first memory of music ever. What's your first memory of music ever, Tyler? Like, the first song you remember putting on and listening to, you remember? - Probably ""Thriller"", actually. - Probably ""Thriller""? Which song? - What do you mean? - Which song from Thriller? Oh, ""Thriller"", the song ""Thriller""? Oh, okay. But how do you erase that stuff from your life, Tyler? It becomes a part of you, right? You know what I always thought would be the craziest conundrum? What if in , Osama bin Laden put out... an incredible jazz album? And people are like, ""This is seminal work. This is Miles Coltrane bin Laden,"" right? Then that day, you're watching the news, and the anchor's on there like, ""Uh, it appears the perpetrator of the attacks was... jazz legend, Osama bin Laden? The saxophone player? Are we sure it's the same guy? Oh, my God, we're in complete shock here in the studio. Uh, right now we have the representative from his record label on the phone, this is Darren from Bop Boppity Bop Bop Records. Darren, what do you think about all this?"" ""I'm in... I'm in complete shock. I-I can't believe it. I was with him a couple of weeks ago, he couldn't have been a nicer guy."" ""Really? A nice guy?"" ""Well, I mean, you know, he helped me move into my apartment. Uh... Used to always pick me up at the airport. Uh... Shit. I should probably tell the FBI about that. Uh... But I really can't believe it."" ""And what about the music, Darren?"" ""Well, you know, we just... recorded this Christmas album with Michael Bubl√©, and, uh... I got to be honest, it's sick. But... we're probably gonna have to shelve it."" ""Probably will have to shelve it. I think this might be a question on a lot of jazz lovers' minds today: Are we still going to be able to enjoy this music? Uh, let's see what the viewers think. Let's go to the phones. We have a gentleman calling from Brooklyn, New York. This is Dan Greenblatt. Dan, what do you think?"" ""Meh, it's not like it was a thousand buildings."" Um... Oh. I don't know what's gonna happen to Michael, but... I think R. Kelly's in a little bit of a pickle. Uh... it seems like he's getting charged. All of the companies have abandoned him. RCA, Sony, all these places. You know, nowadays, you know, you have a big corporation, even one employee does something, the whole company's under fire, right? You know, we saw this with this whole Pizza Hut thing, right? Guy orders a pepperoni pizza. He gets the pizza, the pepperonis are arranged to look like a swastika. But now some people online are saying it doesn't look like a swastika. They're saying it looks like a regular pizza. So the internet is split. I saw it. It kinda looked like a regular pizza to me. I don't know. What do you guys think? Clap if you think it was a swastika. Clap if you think it looks like a swastika. Okay. A couple in the back. Now clap if you think it just looks like a regular pizza. Yeah. So, you, sir, right here... You-- you think it looks like a regular pizza? Yeah? And what, you think this guy's just lying to get attention or something like that? Yeah? And do you remember where you saw it? 'Cause, uh, it was in New York Times and Washington Post, but Washington Post supposedly accidentally posted a digitally-altered photo. Do you remember where you saw it? - Washington Post. - You saw in Washington Post? Okay. Well, you know what's interesting is, um... I just made all that up. None of that happened. I'm not trying to embarrass you, dude, but you and everyone that clapped earlier, you're the fucking problem, okay? What are you doing? This is where we're at now? You think your opinion's so valuable you need to chime in on shit that doesn't even exist? I mean, I do this every night. Every night, people clap. First, the first group claps. ""Yeah, it's a swastika. That's what the country is. Trump probably put those pepperonis on there himself!"" Then, the other crew claps. ""No way. The country's way too sensitive. PC police. Snowflakes!"" And what these people don't realize is despite believing completely different things, they're actually the same person. 'Cause they don't really care about learning, and exploring, and discussing, they just want to chime in with their little programmed reactions. They already know what they think about everything. And the rest of you, the ones that didn't clap, you're not off the hook. I saw your faces. No one was sitting there like, ""Oh, no. This poor guy. I hope that didn't happen."" No, you were all sitting there with the same thought running through your head. ""How did I miss this Pizza Hut thing? You see the--? You see it? I watch so much news. I'm watching CNN all goddamn day! I'm on my phone the rest of the time, I've had my shit locked up in this stupid pouch for an hour, and I'm already behind!"" By the way, you had to be a little skeptical of this thing, 'cause, you know, if this happened, it wouldn't have been a Pizza Hut, it would've happened at Papa John's. Funny! Cool. Some lady just yelled, ""Funny!"" Unnecessary, but appreciated. This is why it's cool to come to live stuff. You never know what's gonna happen, right? ""Funny!"" That's never happened ever in years of doing comedy. So... Ooh! Let's talk about Alzheimer's for a minute. My grandma has Alzheimer's. I just saw her in India over the Christmas holiday. And, um, you know, I don't know if you've got Alzheimer's people in your life, but it's a very sad disease. Uh, she has a caretaker now. This woman named Fatima. And, uh, Fatima kind of explained to me how you hang out with Alzheimer's people, 'cause, you know, they have all these little tics and stuff you gotta account for. Like one thing my grandma would do is she would ask the same questions over and over, you know? Like, one thing she kept asking, she kept going, uh, ""Is Aisha in there making samosas?"" And Fatima would go, ""Yep, she's in there!"" This was very strange to me 'cause Aisha's her sister... th",en,LABEL_0,0.5174987316131592,LABEL_1,0.48250123858451843

Sweet disposition
Never too soon
Oh, reckless abandon
Like no one's watching you

A moment, a love, a dream, aloud
A kiss, a cry, our rights, our wrongs
(A moment, a love) A moment, a love, a dream, aloud
(A moment, a love) A moment, a love, a dream, aloud

So stay there
'Cause I'll be coming over
And while our blood's still young
It's so young, it runs
And won't stop 'til it's over
Won't stop to surrender

Songs of desperation
I played them for you

A moment, a love, a dream, aloud
A kiss, a cry, our rights, our wrongs

Well, I don't know how anyone could wait
The weekend's up, they're trying to relate
Pointless conversations, people we don't know
If you agree, then I think it's time to go
I'm freaking out as people start to stare
Can't get away from this song anywhere
Can you hear me?
Don't pick up your phone
Is there a world where we can be alone?

Sneaking out, I'll try to meet you there
White lights, now we're running down the stairs
Everybody's wasted, throwing away their lives
It's all the same 'cause no one ever tries
Through all the sounds that we're laying on the ground
Don't ever care and the rest is hidden now
How can it be that we are just the same?
Or can it be that, can it be that

I don't wanna wait, not anymore

What I want, you've got and it might be hard to handle

Outside the family stew
Out by the fire breathin'
Outside we wait 'til face turns blue
I know the nervous walkin'
I know the dirty beard hangs

Take me away to nowhere plains

There is a wait so long (So long, so long)
You'll never wait so long

Here comes your man

Big shake on the boxcar movin'
Big shake to the land that's fallin' down
Is a wind makes a palm stop blowin'
A big, big stone fall and break my crown

I'm going back to 505
If it's a seven hour flight or a forty-five minute drive
In my imagination, you're waitin' lyin' on your side
With your hands between your thighs

Stop and wait a sec
And when you look at me like that, my darlin'
What did you expect?
I'd probably still adore you
With your hands around my neck
Or I did last time I checked
Not shy of a spark
The knife twists at the thought
That I should fall short of the mark
Frightened by the bite, though
It's no harsher than the bark
The middle of adventure
Such a perfect place to start

I'm going back to 505

I remember when I first noticed that you liked me back
We were sitting down in a restaurant, waiting for the check
We had made love earlier that day with no strings attached
But I could tell that something had changed, how you looked at me then

Kristen, come right back
I've been waiting for you
To slip back in bed
When you light the candle

And on the Lower East Side, you're dancing with me now
And I'm taking pictures of you with flowers on the wall
Think I like you best when you're dressed in black from head to toe
Think I like you best when you're just with me and no one else

Kristen, come right back
I've been waiting for you
To slip back in bed
When you light the candle

And I'm kissing you, lying in my room
Holding you until you fall asleep
And it's just as good as I knew it would be
Stay with me, I don't want you to leave

 LENNOX, with Attendants, meeting a bleeding Sergeant]
Duncan. What bloody man is that? He can report,
As seemeth by his plight, of the revolt
The newest state. 20Malcolm. This is the sergeant
Who like a good and hardy soldier fought
'Gainst my captivity. Hail, brave friend!
Say to the king the knowledge of the broil
As thou didst leave it. 25Sergeant. Doubtful it stood;
As two spent swimmers, that do cling together
And choke their art. The merciless Macdonwald‚Äî
Worthy to be a rebel, for to that
The multiplying villanies of nature 30
Do swarm upon him‚Äîfrom the western isles
Of kerns and gallowglasses is supplied;
And fortune, on his damned quarrel smiling,
Show'd like a rebel's whore: but all's too weak:
For brave Macbeth‚Äîwell he deserves that name‚Äî 35
Disdaining fortune, with his brandish'd steel,
Which smoked with bloody execution,
Like valour's minion carved out his passage
Till he faced the slave;
Which ne'er shook hands, nor bade farewell to him, 40
Till he unseam'd him from the nave to the chaps,
And fix'd his head upon our battlements.
Duncan. O valiant cousin! worthy gentleman!
Sergeant. As whence the sun 'gins his reflection
Shipwrecking storms and direful thunders break, 45
So from that spring whence comfort seem'd to come
Discomfort swells. Mark, king of Scotland, mark:
No sooner justice had with valour arm'd
Compell'd these skipping kerns to trust their heels,
But the Norweyan lord surveying vantage, 50
With furbish'd arms and new supplies of men
Began a fresh assault.
Duncan. Dismay'd not this
Our captains, Macbeth and Banquo?
Sergeant. Yes; 55
As sparrows eagles, or the hare the lion.
If I say sooth, I must report they were
As cannons overcharged with double cracks, so they
Doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe:
Except they meant to bathe in reeking wounds, 60
Or memorise another Golgotha,
I cannot tell.
But I am faint, my gashes cry for help.
Duncan. So well thy words become thee as thy wounds;
They smack of honour both. Go get him surgeons. 65
Who comes here?
Malcolm. The worthy thane of Ross.
Lennox. What a haste looks through his eyes! So should he look 70
That seems to speak things strange.
Ross. God save the king!
Duncan. Whence camest thou, worthy thane?
Ross. From Fife, great king;
Where the Norweyan banners flout the sky 75
And fan our people cold. Norway himself,
With terrible numbers,
Assisted by that most disloyal traitor
The thane of Cawdor, began a dismal conflict;
Till that Bellona's bridegroom, lapp'd in proof, 80
Confronted him with self-comparisons,
Point against point rebellious, arm 'gainst arm.
Curbing his lavish spirit: and, to conclude,
The victory fell on us.
Duncan. Great happiness! 85Ross. That now
Sweno, the Norways' king, craves composition:
Nor would we deign him burial of his men
Till he disbursed at Saint Colme's inch
Ten thousand dollars to our general use. 90Duncan. No more that thane of Cawdor shall deceive
Our bosom interest: go pronounce his present death,
And with his former title greet Macbeth.
Ross. I'll see it done.
Duncan. What he hath lost noble Macbeth hath won. 95

First Witch. Where hast thou been, sister?
Second Witch. Killing swine.
Third Witch. Sister, where thou? 100First Witch. A sailor's wife had chestnuts in her lap,
And munch'd, and munch'd, and munch'd:‚Äî
'Give me,' quoth I:
'Aroint thee, witch!' the rump-fed ronyon cries.
Her husband's to Aleppo gone, master o' the Tiger: 105
But in a sieve I'll thither sail,
And, like a rat without a tail,
I'll do, I'll do, and I'll do.
Second Witch. I'll give thee a wind.
First Witch. Thou'rt kind. 110Third Witch. And I another.
First Witch. I myself have all the other,
And the very ports they blow,
All the quarters that they know
I' the shipman's card. 115
I will drain him dry as hay:
Sleep shall neither night nor day
Hang upon his pent-house lid;
He shall live a man forbid:
Weary se'nnights nine times nine 120
Shall he dwindle, peak and pine:
Though his bark cannot be lost,
Yet it shall be tempest-tost.
Look what I have.
Second Witch. Show me, show me. 125First Witch. Here I have a pilot's thumb,
Wreck'd as homeward he did come.

Third Witch. A drum, a drum!
Macbeth doth come. 130All. The weird sisters, hand in hand,
Posters of the sea and land,
Thus do go about, about:
Thrice to thine and thrice to mine
And thrice again, to make up nine. 135
Peace! the charm's wound up.

Macbeth. So foul and fair a day I have not seen.
Banquo. How far is't call'd to Forres? What are these
So wither'd and so wild in their attire, 140
That look not like the inhabitants o' the earth,
And yet are on't? Live you? or are you aught
That man may question? You seem to understand me,
By each at once her chappy finger laying
Upon her skinny lips: you should be women, 145
And yet your beards forbid me to interpret
That you are so.
Macbeth. Speak, if you can: what are you?
First Witch. All hail, Macbeth! hail to thee, thane of Glamis!
Second Witch. All hail, Macbeth, hail to thee, thane of Cawdor! 150Third Witch. All hail, Macbeth, thou shalt be king hereafter!
Banquo. Good sir, why do you start; and seem to fear
Things that do sound so fair? I' the name of truth,
Are ye fantastical, or that indeed
Which outwardly ye show? My noble partner 155
You greet with present grace and great prediction
Of noble having and of royal hope,
That he seems rapt withal: to me you speak not.
If you can look into the seeds of time,
And say which grain will grow and which will not, 160
Speak then to me, who neither beg nor fear
Your favours nor your hate.
First Witch. Hail!
Second Witch. Hail!
Third Witch. Hail! 165First Witch. Lesser than Macbeth, and greater.
Second Witch. Not so happy, yet much happier.
Third Witch. Thou shalt get kings, though thou be none:
So all hail, Macbeth and Banquo!
First Witch. Banquo and Macbeth, all hail! 170Macbeth. Stay, you imperfect speakers, tell me more:
By Sinel's death I know I am thane of Glamis;
But how of Cawdor? the thane of Cawdor lives,
A prosperous gentleman; and to be king
Stands not within the prospect of belief, 175
No more than to be Cawdor. Say from whence
You owe this strange intelligence? or why
Upon this blasted heath you stop our way
With such prophetic greeting? Speak, I charge you.

Banquo. The earth hath bubbles, as the water has,
And these are of them. Whither are they vanish'd?
Macbeth. Into the air; and what seem'd corporal melted
As breath into the wind. Would they had stay'd!
Banquo. Were such things here as we do speak about? 185
Or have we eaten on the insane root
That takes the reason prisoner?
Macbeth. Your children shall be kings.
Banquo. You shall be king.
Macbeth. And thane of Cawdor too: went it not so? 190Banquo. To the selfsame tune and words. Who's here?

Ross. The king hath happily received, Macbeth,
The news of thy success; and when he reads
Thy personal venture in the rebels' fight, 195
His wonders and his praises do contend
Which should be thine or his: silenced with that,
In viewing o'er the rest o' the selfsame day,
He finds thee in the stout Norweyan ranks,
Nothing afeard of what thyself didst make, 200
Strange images of death. As thick as hail
Came post with post; and every one did bear
Thy praises in his kingdom's great defence,
And pour'd them down before him.
Angus. We are sent 205
To give thee from our royal master thanks;
Only to herald thee into his sight,
Not pay thee.
Ross. And, for an earnest of a greater honour,
He bade me, from him, call thee thane of Cawdor: 210
In which addition, hail, most worthy thane!
For it is thine.
Banquo. What, can the devil speak true?
Macbeth. The thane of Cawdor lives: why do you dress me
In borrow'd robes? 215Angus. Who was the thane lives yet;
But under heavy judgment bears that life
Which he deserves to lose. Whether he was combined
With those of Norway, or did line the rebel
With hidden help and vantage, or that with both 220
He labour'd in his country's wreck, I know not;
But treasons capital, confess'd and proved,
Have overthrown him.
Macbeth.  Glamis, and thane of Cawdor!
The greatest is behind. 225
Thanks for your pains.
Do you not hope your children shall be kings,
When those that gave the thane of Cawdor to me 230
Promised no less to them?
Banquo. That trusted home
Might yet enkindle you unto the crown,
Besides the thane of Cawdor. But 'tis strange:
And oftentimes, to win us to our harm, 235
The instruments of darkness tell us truths,
Win us with honest trifles, to betray's
In deepest consequence.
Cousins, a word, I pray you.
Macbeth. . Two truths are told, 240
As happy prologues to the swelling act
Of the imperial theme.‚ÄîI thank you, gentlemen.
 This supernatural soliciting]
Cannot be ill, cannot be good: if ill,
Why hath it given me earnest of success, 245
Commencing in a truth? I am thane of Cawdor:
If good, why do I yield to that suggestion
Whose horrid image doth unfix my hair
And make my seated heart knock at my ribs,
Against the use of nature? Present fears 250
Are less than horrible imaginings:
My thought, whose murder yet is but fantastical,
Shakes so my single state of man that function
Is smother'd in surmise, and nothing is
But what is not. 255Banquo. Look, how our partner's rapt.
Macbeth.  If chance will have me king, why, chance may crown me,
Without my stir.
Banquo. New horrors come upon him,
Like our strange garments, cleave not to their mould 260
But with the aid of use.
Macbeth.  Come what come may,
Time and the hour runs through the roughest day.
Banquo. Worthy Macbeth, we stay upon your leisure.
Macbeth. Give me your favour: my dull brain was wrought 265
With things forgotten. Kind gentlemen, your pains
Are register'd where every day I turn
The leaf to read them. Let us toward the king.
Think upon what hath chanced, and, at more time,
The interim having weigh'd it, let us speak 270
Our free hearts each to other.
Banquo. Very gladly.
Macbeth. Till then, enough. Come, friends.

Duncan. Is execution done on Cawdor? Are not
Those in commission yet return'd?
Malcolm. My liege,
They are not yet come back. But I have spoke
With one that saw him die: who did report 280
That very frankly he confess'd his treasons,
Implored your highness' pardon and set forth
A deep repentance: nothing in his life
Became him like the leaving it; he died
As one that had been studied in his death 285
To throw away the dearest thing he owed,
As 'twere a careless trifle.
Duncan. There's no art
To find the mind's construction in the face:
He was a gentleman on whom I built 290
An absolute trust.
O worthiest cousin!
The sin of my ingratitude even now
Was heavy on me: thou art so far before 295
That swiftest wing of recompense is slow
To overtake thee. Would thou hadst less deserved,
That the proportion both of thanks and payment
Might have been mine! only I have left to say,
More is thy due than more than all can pay. 300Macbeth. The service and the loyalty I owe,
In doing it, pays itself. Your highness' part
Is to receive our duties; and our duties
Are to your throne and state children and servants,
Which do but what they should, by doing every thing 305
Safe toward your love and honour.
Duncan. Welcome hither:
I have begun to plant thee, and will labour
To make thee full of growing. Noble Banquo,
That hast no less deserved, nor must be known 310
No less to have done so, let me enfold thee
And hold thee to my heart.
Banquo. There if I grow,
The harvest is your own.
Duncan. My plenteous joys, 315
Wanton in fulness, seek to hide themselves
In drops of sorrow. Sons, kinsmen, thanes,
And you whose places are the nearest, know
We will establish our estate upon
Our eldest, Malcolm, whom we name hereafter 320
The Prince of Cumberland; which honour must
Not unaccompanied invest him only,
But signs of nobleness, like stars, shall shine
On all deservers. From hence to Inverness,
And bind us further to you. 325Macbeth. The rest is labour, which is not used for you:
I'll be myself the harbinger and make joyful
The hearing of my wife with your approach;
So humbly take my leave.
Duncan. My worthy Cawdor! 330Macbeth.  The Prince of Cumberland! that is a step
On which I must fall down, or else o'erleap,
For in my way it lies. Stars, hide your fires;
Let not light see my black and deep desires:
The eye wink at the hand; yet let that be, 335
Which the eye fears, when it is done, to see.

Duncan. True, worthy Banquo; he is full so valiant,
And in his commendations I am fed;
It is a banquet to me. Let's after him, 340
Whose care is gone before to bid us welcome:
It is a peerless kinsman.

Lady Macbeth. 'They met me in the day of success: and I have 345
learned by the perfectest report, they have more in
them than mortal knowledge. When I burned in desire
to question them further, they made themselves air,
into which they vanished. Whiles I stood rapt in
the wonder of it, came missives from the king, who 350
all-hailed me 'Thane of Cawdor;' by which title,
before, these weird sisters saluted me, and referred
me to the coming on of time, with 'Hail, king that
shalt be!' This have I thought good to deliver
thee, my dearest partner of greatness, that thou 355
mightst not lose the dues of rejoicing, by being
ignorant of what greatness is promised thee. Lay it
to thy heart, and farewell.'
Glamis thou art, and Cawdor; and shalt be
What thou art promised: yet do I fear thy nature; 360
It is too full o' the milk of human kindness
To catch the nearest way: thou wouldst be great;
Art not without ambition, but without
The illness should attend it: what thou wouldst highly,
That wouldst thou holily; wouldst not play false, 365
And yet wouldst wrongly win: thou'ldst have, great Glamis,
That which cries 'Thus thou must do, if thou have it;
And that which rather thou dost fear to do
Than wishest should be undone.' Hie thee hither,
That I may pour my spirits in thine ear; 370
And chastise with the valour of my tongue
All that impedes thee from the golden round,
Which fate and metaphysical aid doth seem
To have thee crown'd withal.
 375
What is your tidings?
Messenger. The king comes here to-night.
Lady Macbeth. Thou'rt mad to say it:
Is not thy master with him? who, were't so,
Would have inform'd for preparation. 380Messenger. So please you, it is true: our thane is coming:
One of my fellows had the speed of him,
Who, almost dead for breath, had scarcely more
Than would make up his message.
Lady Macbeth. Give him tending; 385
He brings great news.
The raven himself is hoarse
That croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan
Under my battlements. Come, you spirits 390
That tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here,
And fill me from the crown to the toe top-full
Of direst cruelty! make thick my blood;
Stop up the access and passage to remorse,
That no compunctious visitings of nature 395
Shake my fell purpose, nor keep peace between
The effect and it! Come to my woman's breasts,
And take my milk for gall, you murdering ministers,
Wherever in your sightless substances
You wait on nature's mischief! Come, thick night, 400
And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell,
That my keen knife see not the wound it makes,
Nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark,
To cry 'Hold, hold!'
 405
Great Glamis! worthy Cawdor!
Greater than both, by the all-hail hereafter!
Thy letters have transported me beyond
This ignorant present, and I feel now
The future in the instant. 410Macbeth. My dearest love,
Duncan comes here to-night.
Lady Macbeth. And when goes hence?
Macbeth. To-morrow, as he purposes.
Lady Macbeth. O, never 415
Shall sun that morrow see!
Your face, my thane, is as a book where men
May read strange matters. To beguile the time,
Look like the time; bear welcome in your eye,
Your hand, your tongue: look like the innocent flower, 420
But be the serpent under't. He that's coming
Must be provided for: and you shall put
This night's great business into my dispatch;
Which shall to all our nights and days to come
Give solely sovereign sway and masterdom. 425Macbeth. We will speak further.
Lady Macbeth. Only look up clear;
To alter favour ever is to fear:
Leave all the rest to me.

 DONALBAIN, BANQUO, LENNOX, MACDUFF, ROSS, ANGUS, and Attendants]
Duncan. This castle hath a pleasant seat; the air
Nimbly and sweetly recommends itself
Unto our gentle senses. 435Banquo. This guest of summer,
The temple-haunting martlet, does approve,
By his loved mansionry, that the heaven's breath
Smells wooingly here: no jutty, frieze,
Buttress, nor coign of vantage, but this bird 440
Hath made his pendent bed and procreant cradle:
Where they most breed and haunt, I have observed,
The air is delicate.

Duncan. See, see, our honour'd hostess! 445
The love that follows us sometime is our trouble,
Which still we thank as love. Herein I teach you
How you shall bid God 'ild us for your pains,
And thank us for your trouble.
Lady Macbeth. All our service 450
In every point twice done and then done double
Were poor and single business to contend
Against those honours deep and broad wherewith
Your majesty loads our house: for those of old,
And the late dignities heap'd up to them, 455
We rest your hermits.
Duncan. Where's the thane of Cawdor?
We coursed him at the heels, and had a purpose
To be his purveyor: but he rides well;
And his great love, sharp as his spur, hath holp him 460
To his home before us. Fair and noble hostess,
We are your guest to-night.
Lady Macbeth. Your servants ever
Have theirs, themselves and what is theirs, in compt,
To make their audit at your highness' pleasure, 465
Still to return your own.
Duncan. Give me your hand;
Conduct me to mine host: we love him highly,
And shall continue our graces towards him.
By your leave, hostess. 470

 Servants with dishes and service, and pass over the stage. Then enter MACBETH]
Macbeth. If it were done when 'tis done, then 'twere well
It were done quickly: if the assassination 475
Could trammel up the consequence, and catch
With his surcease success; that but this blow
Might be the be-all and the end-all here,
But here, upon this bank and shoal of time,
We'ld jump the life to come. But in these cases 480
We still have judgment here; that we but teach
Bloody instructions, which, being taught, return
To plague the inventor: this even-handed justice
Commends the ingredients of our poison'd chalice
To our own lips. He's here in double trust; 485
First, as I am his kinsman and his subject,
Strong both against the deed; then, as his host,
Who should against his murderer shut the door,
Not bear the knife myself. Besides, this Duncan
Hath borne his faculties so meek, hath been 490
So clear in his great office, that his virtues
Will plead like angels, trumpet-tongued, against
The deep damnation of his taking-off;
And pity, like a naked new-born babe,
Striding the blast, or heaven's cherubim, horsed 495
Upon the sightless couriers of the air,
Shall blow the horrid deed in every eye,
That tears shall drown the wind. I have no spur
To prick the sides of my intent, but only
Vaulting ambition, which o'erleaps itself 500
And falls on the other.
How now! what news?
Lady Macbeth. He has almost supp'd: why have you left the chamber?
Macbeth. Hath he ask'd for me? 505Lady Macbeth. Know you not he has?
Macbeth. We will proceed no further in this business:
He hath honour'd me of late; and I have bought
Golden opinions from all sorts of people,
Which would be worn now in their newest gloss, 510
Not cast aside so soon.
Lady Macbeth. Was the hope drunk
Wherein you dress'd yourself? hath it slept since?
And wakes it now, to look so green and pale
At what it did so freely? From this time 515
Such I account thy love. Art thou afeard
To be the same in thine own act and valour
As thou art in desire? Wouldst thou have that
Which thou esteem'st the ornament of life,
And live a coward in thine own esteem, 520
Letting 'I dare not' wait upon 'I would,'
Like the poor cat i' the adage?
Macbeth. Prithee, peace:
I dare do all that may become a man;
Who dares do more is none. 525Lady Macbeth. What beast was't, then,
That made you break this enterprise to me?
When you durst do it, then you were a man;
And, to be more than what you were, you would
Be so much more the man. Nor time nor place 530
Did then adhere, and yet you would make both:
They have made themselves, and that their fitness now
Does unmake you. I have given suck, and know
How tender 'tis to love the babe that milks me:
I would, while it was smiling in my face, 535
Have pluck'd my nipple from his boneless gums,
And dash'd the brains out, had I so sworn as you
Have done to this.
Macbeth. If we should fail?
Lady Macbeth. We fail! 540
But screw your courage to the sticking-place,
And we'll not fail. When Duncan is asleep‚Äî
Whereto the rather shall his day's hard journey
Soundly invite him‚Äîhis two chamberlains
Will I with wine and wassail so convince 545
That memory, the warder of the brain,
Shall be a fume, and the receipt of reason
A limbeck only: when in swinish sleep
Their drenched natures lie as in a death,
What cannot you and I perform upon 550
The unguarded Duncan? what not put upon
His spongy officers, who shall bear the guilt
Of our great quell?
Macbeth. Bring forth men-children only;
For thy undaunted mettle should compose 555
Nothing but males. Will it not be received,
When we have mark'd with blood those sleepy two
Of his own chamber and used their very daggers,
That they have done't?
Lady Macbeth. Who dares receive it other, 560
As we shall make our griefs and clamour roar
Upon his death?
Macbeth. I am settled, and bend up
Each corporal agent to this terrible feat.
Away, and mock the time with fairest show: 565
False face must hide what the false heart doth know.

Banquo. How goes the night, boy?
Fleance. The moon is down; I have not heard the clock. 570Banquo. And she goes down at twelve.
Fleance. I take't, 'tis later, sir.
Banquo. Hold, take my sword. There's husbandry in heaven;
Their candles are all out. Take thee that too.
A heavy summons lies like lead upon me, 575
And yet I would not sleep: merciful powers,
Restrain in me the cursed thoughts that nature
Gives way to in repose!
Give me my sword. 580
Who's there?
Macbeth. A friend.
Banquo. What, sir, not yet at rest? The king's a-bed:
He hath been in unusual pleasure, and
Sent forth great largess to your offices. 585
This diamond he greets your wife withal,
By the name of most kind hostess; and shut up
In measureless content.
Macbeth. Being unprepared,
Our will became the servant to defect; 590
Which else should free have wrought.
Banquo. All's well.
I dreamt last night of the three weird sisters:
To you they have show'd some truth.
Macbeth. I think not of them: 595
Yet, when we can entreat an hour to serve,
We would spend it in some words upon that business,
If you would grant the time.
Banquo. At your kind'st leisure.
Macbeth. If you shall cleave to my consent, when 'tis, 600
It shall make honour for you.
Banquo. So I lose none
In seeking to augment it, but still keep
My bosom franchised and allegiance clear,
I shall be counsell'd. 605Macbeth. Good repose the while!
Banquo. Thanks, sir: the like to you!

Macbeth. Go bid thy mistress, when my drink is ready,
She strike upon the bell. Get thee to bed. 610
Is this a dagger which I see before me,
The handle toward my hand? Come, let me clutch thee.
I have thee not, and yet I see thee still.
Art thou not, fatal vision, sensible 615
To feeling as to sight? or art thou but
A dagger of the mind, a false creation,
Proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain?
I see thee yet, in form as palpable
As this which now I draw. 620
Thou marshall'st me the way that I was going;
And such an instrument I was to use.
Mine eyes are made the fools o' the other senses,
Or else worth all the rest; I see thee still,
And on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood, 625
Which was not so before. There's no such thing:
It is the bloody business which informs
Thus to mine eyes. Now o'er the one halfworld
Nature seems dead, and wicked dreams abuse
The curtain'd sleep; witchcraft celebrates 630
Pale Hecate's offerings, and wither'd murder,
Alarum'd by his sentinel, the wolf,
Whose howl's his watch, thus with his stealthy pace.
With Tarquin's ravishing strides, towards his design
Moves like a ghost. Thou sure and firm-set earth, 635
Hear not my steps, which way they walk, for fear
Thy very stones prate of my whereabout,
And take the present horror from the time,
Which now suits with it. Whiles I threat, he lives:
Words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives. 640
I go, and it is done; the bell invites me.
Hear it not, Duncan; for it is a knell
That summons thee to heaven or to hell.

Lady Macbeth. That which hath made them drunk hath made me bold;
What hath quench'd them hath given me fire.
Hark! Peace!
It was the owl that shriek'd, the fatal bellman, 650
Which gives the stern'st good-night. He is about it:
The doors are open; and the surfeited grooms
Do mock their charge with snores: I have drugg'd
their possets,
That death and nature do contend about them, 655
Whether they live or die.
Macbeth.  Who's there? what, ho!
Lady Macbeth. Alack, I am afraid they have awaked,
And 'tis not done. The attempt and not the deed
Confounds us. Hark! I laid their daggers ready; 660
He could not miss 'em. Had he not resembled
My father as he slept, I had done't.
My husband!
Macbeth. I have done the deed. Didst thou not hear a noise? 665Lady Macbeth. I heard the owl scream and the crickets cry.
Did not you speak?
Macbeth. When?
Lady Macbeth. Now.
Macbeth. As I descended? 670Lady Macbeth. Ay.
Macbeth. Hark!
Who lies i' the second chamber?
Lady Macbeth. Donalbain.
Macbeth. This is a sorry sight. 675
Lady Macbeth. A foolish thought, to say a sorry sight.
Macbeth. There's one did laugh in's sleep, and one cried
'Murder!'
That they did wake each other: I stood and heard them: 680
But they did say their prayers, and address'd them
Again to sleep.
Lady Macbeth. There are two lodged together.
Macbeth. One cried 'God bless us!' and 'Amen' the other;
As they had seen me with these hangman's hands. 685
Listening their fear, I could not say 'Amen,'
When they did say 'God bless us!'
Lady Macbeth. Consider it not so deeply.
Macbeth. But wherefore could not I pronounce 'Amen'?
I had most need of blessing, and 'Amen' 690
Stuck in my throat.
Lady Macbeth. These deeds must not be thought
After these ways; so, it will make us mad.
Macbeth. Methought I heard a voice cry 'Sleep no more!
Macbeth does murder sleep', the innocent sleep, 695
Sleep that knits up the ravell'd sleeve of care,
The death of each day's life, sore labour's bath,
Balm of hurt minds, great nature's second course,
Chief nourisher in life's feast,‚Äî
Lady Macbeth. What do you mean? 700Macbeth. Still it cried 'Sleep no more!' to all the house:
'Glamis hath murder'd sleep, and therefore Cawdor
Shall sleep no more; Macbeth shall sleep no more.'
Lady Macbeth. Who was it that thus cried? Why, worthy thane,
You do unbend your noble strength, to think 705
So brainsickly of things. Go get some water,
And wash this filthy witness from your hand.
Why did you bring these daggers from the place?
They must lie there: go carry them; and smear
The sleepy grooms with blood. 710Macbeth. I'll go no more:
I am afraid to think what I have done;
Look on't again I dare not.
Lady Macbeth. Infirm of purpose!
Give me the daggers: the sleeping and the dead 715
Are but as pictures: 'tis the eye of childhood
That fears a painted devil. If he do bleed,
I'll gild the faces of the grooms withal;
For it must seem their guilt.

Macbeth. Whence is that knocking?
How is't with me, when every noise appals me?
What hands are here? ha! they pluck out mine eyes.
Will all great Neptune's ocean wash this blood
Clean from my hand? No, this my hand will rather 725
The multitudinous seas in incarnadine,
Making the green one red.

Lady Macbeth. My hands are of your colour; but I shame
To wear a heart so white. 730
I hear a knocking
At the south entry: retire we to our chamber;
A little water clears us of this deed:
How easy is it, then! Your constancy 735
Hath left you unattended.
Hark! more knocking.
Get on your nightgown, lest occasion call us,
And show us to be watchers. Be not lost 740
So poorly in your thoughts.
Macbeth. To know my deed, 'twere best not know myself.
Wake Duncan with thy knocking! I would thou couldst!

Porter. Here's a knocking indeed! If a
man were porter of hell-gate, he should have
old turning the key.
 750
Knock,
knock, knock! Who's there, i' the name of
Beelzebub? Here's a farmer, that hanged
himself on the expectation of plenty: come in
time; have napkins enow about you; here 755
you'll sweat for't.
Knock,
knock! Who's there, in the other devil's
name? Faith, here's an equivocator, that could 760
swear in both the scales against either scale;
who committed treason enough for God's sake,
yet could not equivocate to heaven: O, come
in, equivocator.
 765
Knock,
knock, knock! Who's there? Faith, here's an
English tailor come hither, for stealing out of
a French hose: come in, tailor; here you may
roast your goose. 770
Knock,
knock; never at quiet! What are you? But
this place is too cold for hell. I'll devil-porter
it no further: I had thought to have let in 775
some of all professions that go the primrose
way to the everlasting bonfire.
Anon, anon! I pray you, remember the porter.


Macduff. Was it so late, friend, ere you went to bed,
That you do lie so late?
Porter. 'Faith sir, we were carousing till the
second cock: and drink, sir, is a great 785
provoker of three things.
Macduff. What three things does drink especially provoke?
Porter. Marry, sir, nose-painting, sleep, and
urine. Lechery, sir, it provokes, and unprovokes;
it provokes the desire, but it takes 790
away the performance: therefore, much drink
may be said to be an equivocator with lechery:
it makes him, and it mars him; it sets
him on, and it takes him off; it persuades him,
and disheartens him; makes him stand to, and 795
not stand to; in conclusion, equivocates him
in a sleep, and, giving him the lie, leaves him.
Macduff. I believe drink gave thee the lie last night.
Porter. That it did, sir, i' the very throat on
me: but I requited him for his lie; and, I 800
think, being too strong for him, though he took
up my legs sometime, yet I made a shift to cast
him.
Macduff. Is thy master stirring?
 805
Our knocking has awaked him; here he comes.
Lennox. Good morrow, noble sir.
Macbeth. Good morrow, both.
Macduff. Is the king stirring, worthy thane?
Macbeth. Not yet. 810Macduff. He did command me to call timely on him:
I have almost slipp'd the hour.
Macbeth. I'll bring you to him.
Macduff. I know this is a joyful trouble to you;
But yet 'tis one. 815Macbeth. The labour we delight in physics pain.
This is the door.
Macduff. I'll make so bold to call,
For 'tis my limited service.

Lennox. Goes the king hence to-day?
Macbeth. He does: he did appoint so.
Lennox. The night has been unruly: where we lay,
Our chimneys were blown down; and, as they say,
Lamentings heard i' the air; strange screams of death, 825
And prophesying with accents terrible
Of dire combustion and confused events
New hatch'd to the woeful time: the obscure bird
Clamour'd the livelong night: some say, the earth
Was feverous and did shake. 830Macbeth. 'Twas a rough night.
Lennox. My young remembrance cannot parallel
A fellow to it.

Macduff. O horror, horror, horror! Tongue nor heart 835
Cannot conceive nor name thee!
Macbeth.  What's the matter.
Macduff. Confusion now hath made his masterpiece!
Most sacrilegious murder hath broke ope
The Lord's anointed temple, and stole thence 840
The life o' the building!
Macbeth. What is 't you say? the life?

I got the good side of things
Left you with both of the rings
My fingers danced and swayed in the breeze
The change in the wind took you down to your knees
I got the good side of you
Send it out into the blue
The people danced to the sound of your heart
The world sang along to it falling apart

But I sympathize, and I recognize
And baby, I apologize
That I got the good side
The good side of things

I got the good side of life
Travelled the universe twice
So many thoughts I wanted to share
But I didn't call because it wouldn't be fair
Then I got the good side of new
Found arms to fall right into
I know how it looked, it wasn't the plan
And some day I hope that you'll understand
You might also like
That I sympathize, and I recognize
And baby, I apologize
That I got the good side
The good side of things

I'm sure we'll meet in the spring
And catch up on everything
I'll say I'm proud of all that you've done
You taught me the ropes, and you taught me to love

Rows of flimsy houses with gaping doors. Rare lamps with faint rainbow fans. Round Rabaiotti's halted ice gondola stunted men and women squabble. They grab wafers between which are wedged lumps of coal and copper snow. Sucking, they scatter slowly. Children. The swancomb of the gondola, highreared, forges on through the murk, white and blue under a lighthouse. Whistles call and answer.
THE CALLS Wait, my love, and I'll be with you.

THE ANSWERS Round behind the stable.
(A deaf mute idiot with goggle eyes, his shapeless mouth dribbling, jerks past, shaken in Saint Vitus' dance. A chain of children's hands imprisons him.)
THE CHILDREN Kithoguel Salute.
THE IDIOT (Lifts a palsied left arm and gurgles.) Grhahute!
THE CHILDREN Where's the great light?
THE IDIOT (Gobbing.) Ghaghahest.
(They release him. He jerks on. A pygmy woman swings on a rope slung between the railings, counting. A form sprawled against a dustbin and muffled by its arm and hat moves, groans, grinding growling teeth, and snores again. On a step a gnome totting among a rubbish tip crouches to shoulder a sack of rags and bones. A crone standing by with a smoky oil lamp rams the last bottle in the maw of his sack. He heaves his booty, tugs askew his peaked cap and hobbles off mutely. The crone makes back for her lair swaying her lamp. A bandy child, asquat on the doorstep with a papershuttlecock, crawls sidling after her in spurts, clutches her skirt, scrambles up. A drunken navvy ups with both hands the railings of an area, lurching heavily. At a corner two night watch in shoulder capes, their hands upon their staffholsters, loom tall. A plate crashes; a woman screams; a child wails. Oaths of a man roar, mutter, cease. Figures wander, lurk, peer from warrens. In a room lit by a candle stuck in a bottleneck a slut combs out the tatts from the hair of a scrofulous child. Cissy Caffrey's voice, still young, sings shrill from a lane.)
CISSY CAFFREY

I gave it to Molly
Because she was jolly,
The leg of the duck
The leg of the duck.
(Private Cart and Private Compton, swaggersticks tight in their oxters, as they march unsteadily rightaboutface and burst together from their mouths a volleyed fart. Laughter of men from the lane. A hoarse virago retorts.)
THE VIRAGO Signs on you, hairy arse. More power the Cavan girl.
CISSY CAFFREY More luck to me. Cavan, Cootehill and Belturbet.
(She sings.)
I gave it to Nelly
To stick in her belly
The leg of the duck
The leg of the duck.

(Private Cart and Private Compton turn and counterretort, their tunics bloodbright in a lampglow, black sockets of caps on their blond copper polls. Stephen Dedalus and Lynch pass through the crowd close to the redcoats.)
PRIVATE COMPTON (Jerks his finger.) Way for the parson.
PRIVATE CARR (Turns and calls.) What ho, parson!
CISSY CAFFREY (Her voice soaring higher.)
She has it, she got it,
Wherever she put it
The leg of the duck.
(Stephen, flourishing the ashplant in his left hand, chants with joy the introit for paschal time. Lynch, his jockey cap low on his brow, attends him, a sneer of discontent wrinkling his face.)
STEPHEN Vidi aquam egredientem de templo a latere dextro. Alleluia.
(The famished snaggletusks of an elderly bawd protrude from a doorway.)
THE BAWD (Her voice whispering huskily.) Sst! Come here till I tell you. Maidenhead inside. Sst.
STEPHEN (Altius aliqantulum) Et omnes ad quos pervenit acqua ista.
THE BAWD (Spits in their trail her jet of venom.) Trinity medicals. Fallopian tube. All prick and no pence.
(Edy Boardman, sniffling, crouched with Bertha Supple, draws her shawl across her nostrils.)
EDY BOARDMAN (Bickering.) And say the one: I seen you up Faithful place with your squarepusher, the greaser off the railway, in his cometobed hat. Did you, says I. That's not for you to say, says I. You never seen me in the mantrap with a married highlander, says I. The likes of her! Stag that one is. Stubborn as a mule! And her walking with two fellows the one time, Kildbride the enginedriver and lancecorporal Oliphant.
STEPHEN (Triumphaliter.) Salvi facti i sunt.
(He flourishes his ashplant shivering the lamp image, shattering light over the world. A liver and white spaniel on the prowl slinks after him, growling. Lynch scar's it with a kick.)
LYNCH So that?
STEPHEN (Looks behind.) So that gesture, not music, not odours, would be a universal language, the gift of tongues rendering visible not the lay sense but the first entelechy, the structural rhythm.
LYNCH Pornosophical philotheology. Metaphysics in Mecklenburg street!
STEPHEN We have shrewridden Shakespeare and henpecked Socrates. Even the allwisest stagyrite was bitted, bridled and mounted by a light of love.
LYNCH Ba!
STEPHEN Anyway, who wants two gestures to illustrate a loaf and a jug? This movement illustrates the loaf and jug of bread and wine in Omar. Hold my stick.
LYNCH Damn your yellow stick. Where are we going?
STEPHEN Lecherous lynx, to la belle dame sans merci, Georgina Johnson, ad deam qui laetificat juventutem meam.
(Stephen thrusts the ashplant on him and slowly holds out his hands, his head going back till both hands are a span from his breast, down turned in planes intersecting, the fingers about to part, the left being higher.)
LYNCH Which is the jug of bread? It skills not. That or the customhouse. Illustrate thou. Here take your crutch and walk.
(They pass. Tommy Caffrey scrambles to a gaslamp and, clasping, climbs in spasms. From the top spur he slides down. Jacky Caffrey clasps to climb. The navvy lurches against the lamp. The twins scuttle off in the dark. The navvy, swaying, presses a forefinger against a wing of his nose and ejects from the farther nostril a long liquid jet of snot. Shouldering the lamp he staggers away through the crowd with his flaring cresset.
Snakes of river fog creep slowly. From drains, clefts, cesspools, middens arise on all sides stagnant fumes. A glow leaps in the south beyond the seaward reaches of the river. The navvy staggering forward cleaves the crowd and lurches towards the tramsiding. On the farther side under the railway bridge Bloom appears flushed, panting, cramming bread and chocolate into a side pocket. From Gillens hairdressers window a composite portrait shows him gallant Nelson's image. A concave mirror at the side presents to him lovelorn longlost lugubru Booloohoom. Grave Gladstone sees him level Bloom for Bloom. He passes, struck by the stare of truculent Wellington but in the con vex mirror grin unstruck the bonham eyes and fatchuck cheekchops of Jollypoldy the rixdix doldy.
At Antonio Babaiotti's door Bloom halts, sweated under the bright arclamps. He disappears. In a moment he reappears and hurries on.)
BLOOM Fish and taters. N. g. Ah!
(He disappears into Olhousen's, the pork butcher's, under the downcoming rollshutter. A few moments later he emerges from under the shutter puffing Poldy, blowing Bloohoom. In each hand he holds a parcel, one containing a lukewarm pig's crubeen, the other a cold sheep's trotter sprinkled with wholepepper He gasps, standing upright. Then bending to one side he presses a parcel against his rib and groans.)
BLOOM Stitch in my side. Why did I run?
(He takes breath with care and goes forward slowly towards the lampset siding. The glow leaps again.)
BLOOM What is that? A flasher? Searchlight.
(He stands at Cormack's corner watching.)
BLOOM Aurora borealis or a steel foundry? Ah, the brigade, of course. South side anyhow. Big blaze. Might be his house. Beggar's bush. We're safe. (He hums cheerfully.) London's burning, London's burning! On fire, on fire! (He catches sight of the navvy lurching through the crowd at the farther side of Talbot street.) I'll miss him. Run. Quick. Better cross here.
(He darts to cross the road. Urchins shout.)
THE URCHINS Mind out, mister! (Two cyclists, with lighted paper lanterns aswing, swim by him, grazing him, their bells rattling.)
THE BELLS Haltyaltyaltyall.
BLOOM (Halts erect stung by a spasm.) Ow.
(He looks round, darts forward suddenly. Through rising fog a dragon sandstrewer, travelling at caution, slews heavily down upon him, its huge red headlight winking, its trolley hissing on the wire. The motorman bangs his footgong.)
THE GONG Bang Bang Bla Bak Blud Bugg Bloo.
(The brake cracks violently. Bloom, raising a policeman's whitegloved hand, blunders stifflegged, out of the track. The motorman thrown forward, pugnosed, on the guidewheel, yells as he slides past over chains and keys.)
THE MOTORMAN Hey, shitbreeches, are you doing the hattrick?
BLOOM (Bloom trickleaps to the curbstone and halts again. He brushes a mudflake from his cheek with a parcelled hand.) No thoroughfare. Close shave that but cured the stitch. Must take up Sandow's exercises again. On the hands down. Insure against street accident too. The Providential. (He feels his trouser pocket.) Poor mamma's panacea. Heel easily catch in tracks or bootlace in a cog. Day the wheel of the black Maria peeled off my shoe at Leonard's corner. Third time is the charm. Shoe trick. Insolent driver. I ought to report him. Tension makes them nervous. Might be the fellow balked me this morning with that horsey woman. Same style of beauty. Quick of him all the same. The stiff walk. True word spoken in jest. That awful cramp in Lad lane. Something poisonous I ate. Emblem of luck. Why? Probably lost cattle. Mark of the beast. (He closes his eyes an instant.) Bit light in the head. Monthly or effect of the other. Brainfogfag. That tired feeling. Too much for me now. Ow!
(A sinister figure leans on plaited legs against O'Beirnes wall, a visage unknown, injected with dark mercury. From under a wideleaved sombrero the figure regards him with evil eye.)
BLOOM Buenos noches, se√±orita Blanca, que calle es esta?
THE FIGURE (Impassive, raises a signal arm.) Password. Sraid Mabbot.
BLOOM Haha. Merci. Esperanto. Slan leath. (He mutters.) Gaelic league spy, sent by that fireeater.
(He steps forward. A sackshouldered ragman bars his path. He steps left, ragsackman left.)
BLOOM I beg. (He swerves, sidles, stepsaside, slips past and on.)
BLOOM Keep to the right, right, right. If there is a fingerpost planted by the Touring Club at Stepaside who procured that public boon? I who lost my way and contributed to the columns of the Irish Cyclist the letter headed, In darkest Stepaside. Keep, keep, keep to the right. Rags and bones, at midnight. A fence more likely. First place murderer makes for. Wash off his sins of the world.
(Jacky Caffrey, hunted by Tommy Caffrey, runs full tilt against Bloom.)
BLOOM O!
(Shocked, on weak hams, he halts. Tommy and Jacky vanish there, there. Bloom pats with parcelled hands watch, fobpocket, bookpocket, pursepocket, sweets of sin, potato soap.)
BLOOM Beware of pickpockets. Old thieves' dodge. Collide. Then snatch your purse.
(The retriever approaches sniffling, nose to the ground. A sprawled form sneezes. A stooped bearded figure appears garbed in the long caftan of an elder in Zion and a smoking cap with magenta tassels. Horned spectacles hang down at the wings of the nose. Yellow poison streaks are on the drawn face.)
RUDOLPH Second halfcrown waste money today. I told you not go with drunken goy ever. So. You catch no money.
BLOOM (Hides the crubeen and trotter behind his back and, crestfallen, feels warm and cold feetmeat) Ja, ich weiss, papachi.
RUDOLPH What you making down this place? Have you no soul? (With feeble vulture talons he feels the silent face of Bloom) Are you not my son Leopold, the grandson of Leopold? Are you not my dear son Leopold who left the house of his father and left the god of his fathers Abraham and Jacob?
BLOOM (With precaution.) I suppose so, father. Mosenthal. All that's left of him.
RUDOLPH (Severely.) One night they bring you home drunk as dog after spend your good money. What you call them running chaps?
BLOOM (In youth's smart blue Oxford suit with white vestslips, narrowshouldered, in brown Alpine hat, wearing gent's sterling silver waterbury keyless watch and double curb Albert with seal attached, one side of him coated with stiffening mud.) Harriers, father. Only that once.
RUDOLPH Once! Mud head to foot. Cut your hand open. Lockjaw. They make you kaput, Leopoldleben. You watch them chaps.
BLOOM (Weakly.) They challenged me to a sprint. It was muddy. I slipped.
RUDOLPH (With contempt) Ooim nachez. Nice spectacles for your poor mother!
BLOOM Mamma!
ELLEN BLOOM (In pantomime dame's stringed mobcap, crinoline and bustle, widow Twankey's blouse with muttonleg sleeves buttoned behind, grey mittens and cameo brooch, her hairplaited in a crisping net, appears over the staircase banisters, a slanted candlestick in her hand and cries out in shrill alarm.) O blessed Redeemer, what have they done to him! My smelling salts! (She hauls up a reef of skirt and ransacks the pouch of her striped blay petticoat. A phial, an Agnus Dei, a shrivelled potato and a celluloid doll fall out.) Sacred Heart of Mary, where were you at all, at all?
(Bloom, mumbling, his eyes downcast, begins to bestow his parcels in his filled pockets but desists, muttering.)
A VOICE (Sharply.) Poldy!
BLOOM Who? (He ducks and wards off a blow clumsily.) At your service.
(He looks up. Beside her mirage of datepalms a handsome woman in Turkish costume stands before him. Opulent curves fill out her scarlet trousers and jacket slashed with gold. A wide yells cummerbund girdles her. A white yashmak violet in the night, covers her face, leaving free only her lace dark eyes and raven hair.)
BLOOM Molly!
MARION Welly? Mrs Marion from this out, my dear man, when you speak to me. (Satirically.) Has poor little hubby cold feet waiting so long?
BLOOM (Shifts from foot to foot.) No, no. Not the least little bit.
(He breathes in deep agitation, swallowing gulps of air questions, hopes, crubeens for her supper things to tell her excuses, desire, spellbound. A coin gleams on her forehead. On her feet are jewelled toerings. Her ankles are linked by a slender fetterchain. Beside her a camel, hooded with a turreting turban, waits. A silk ladder of innumerable rungs climbs to his bobbing howdah. He ambles near with disgruntled hindquarters. Fiercely she slaps his haunch, her goldcurb wristbangles angriling, scolding him in Moorish.)
MARION Nebrakada! Feminimum.
(The camel, lifting a foreleg, plucks from a tree a lace mango fruit, offers it to his mistress, blinking, in his cloven hoof then droops his head and, grunting, with uplifted neck, fumbles to kneel. Bloom stoops his back for leapfrog.)
BLOOM I can give you... I mean as your business menagerer Mrs Marion... if you...
MARION So you notice some change? (Her hands passing slowly over her trinketed stomacher. A slow friendly mockery in her eyes.) O Poldy, Poldy, you are a poor old stick in the mud! Go and see life. See the wide world.
BLOOM I was just going back for that lotion whitewax, orangeflower water. Shop closes early on Thursday. But the first thing in the morning. (He pats divers pockets.) This moving kidney. Ah!
(He points to the south, then to the east. A cake of new clean lemon soap arises, diffusing light and perfume.)
THE SOAP
We're a capital couple are Bloom and I;
He brightens the earth, I polish the sky.

(The freckled face of Sweny, the druggist, appears in the disc of the soapsun.)
SWENY Three and a penny, please.
BLOOM Yes. For my wife, Mrs Marion. Special recipe.
MARION (Softly.) Poldy!
BLOOM Yes, ma'am?
MARION Ti trema un poco il cuore?
(In disdain she saunters away, plump as a pampered pouter pigeon, humming the duet from Don Giovanni)
BLOOM Are you sure about that Voglio? I mean the pronunciati...
(He follows, followed by the sniffing terrier. The elderly bawd seizes his sleeve, the bristles of her chinmole glittering.)
THE BAWD Ten shillings a maidenhead. Fresh thing was never touched. Fifteen. There's no-one in it only her old father that's dead drunk.
(She points. In the gap of her dark den furtive, rainbedraggled Bridie Kelly stands.)
BRIDIE Hatch street. Any good in your mind?
(With a squeak she flaps her bat shawl and runs. A burly rough pursues with booted strides. He stumbles on the steps, recovers, plunges into gloom. Weak squeaks of laughter are heard, weaker.)
THE BAWD (Her wolfeyes shining.) He's getting his pleasure. You won't get a virgin in the flash houses. Ten shillings. Don't be all night before the polis in plain clothes sees us. Sixtyseven is a bitch.
(Leering Gerty MacDowell limps forward. She draws from behind ogling, and shows coyly her bloodied clout.)
GERTY With all my worldly goods I thee and thou. (She murmurs.) You did that. I hate you.
BLOOM I? When? You're dreaming. I never saw you.
THE BAWD Leave the gentleman alone, you cheat. Writing the gentleman false letters. Streetwalking and soliciting. Better for your mother take the strap to you at the bedpost, hussy like you.
GERTY (To Bloom.) When you saw all the secrets of my bottom drawer. (She paws his sleeve, slobbering.) Dirty married man! I love you for doing that to me.
(She slides away crookedly. Mrs Breen in man's frieze overcoat with loose bellows pockets, stands in the causeway, her roguish eyes wideopen, smiling in all her herbivorous buckteeth.)
MRS BREEN Mr.
BLOOM (Coughs gravely.) Madam, when we last had this pleasure by letter dated the sixteenth instant .
MRS BREEN Mr Bloom! You down here in the haunts of sin! I caught you nicely! Scamp!
BLOOM (Hurriedly.) Not so loud my name. Whatever do you think me? Don't give me away. Walls have hears. How do you do? It's ages since I. You're looking splendid. Absolutely it. Seasonable weather we are having this time of year. Black refracts heat. Short cut home here. Interesting quarter. Rescue of fallen women Magdalen asylum. I am the secretary...
MRS BREEN (Holds up a finger.) Now don't tell a big fib! I know somebody won't like that. O just wait till I see Molly! (Slily.) Account for yourself this very minute or woe betide you!
BLOOM (Looks behind.) She often said she'd like to visit. Slumming. The exotic, you see. Negro servants too in livery if she had money. Othello black brute. Eugene Stratton. Even the bones and cornerman at the Livermore christies. Bohee brothers. Sweep for that matter.
(Tom and Sam Bohee, coloured coons in white duck suits, scarlet socks, upstarched Sambo chokers and lace scarlet asters in their buttonholes leap out. Each has his banjo slung. Their paler smaller negroid hands jingle the twingtwang wires. Flashing white Kaffir eyes and tusks they rattle through a breakdown in clumsy clogs, twinging, singing, back to back, toe heel, heel toe, with smackfatclacking nigger lips.)
There's someone in the house with Dina
There's someone in the house, I know,
There's someone in the house with Dina
Playing on the old banjo.

(They whisk black masks from raw babby faces: then, chuckling, chortling, trumming, twanging they diddle diddle cakewalk dance away.)
BLOOM (With a sour tenderish smile.) A little frivol, shall we, if you are so inclined? Would you like me perhaps to embrace you just for a fraction of a second?
MRS BREEN (Screams gaily.) O, you ruck! You ought to see yourself!
BLOOM For old sake'sake. I only meant a square party, a mixed marriage mingling of our different little conjugials. You know I had a soft corner for you. (Gloomily.) 'Twas I sent you that valentine of the dear gazelle.
MRS BREEN Glory Alice, you do look a holy show! Killing simply. (She puts out her hand inquisitively.) What are you hiding behind your back? Tell us, there's a dear.
BLOOM (Seizes her wrist with his free hand.) Josie Powell that was, prettiest deb in Dublin. How time flies by! Do you remember, harking back in a retrospective arrangement, Old Christmas night Georgina Simpson's housewarming while they were playing the Irving Bishop game, finding the pin blindfold and thoughtreading? Subject, what is in this snuff box?
MRS BREEN You were the lion of the night with your seriocomic recitation and you looked the part. You were always a favourite with the ladies.
BLOOM (Squire of dames, in dinner jacket, with watered-silk facings, blue masonic badge in his buttonhole, black bow and mother-of-pearl studs, a prismatic champagne glass tilted in his hand.) Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Ireland, home and beauty.
MRS BREEN The dear dead days beyond recall. Love's old sweet song.
BLOOM (Meaningfully dropping his voice.) I confess I'm teapot with curiosity to find out whether some person's something is a little teapot at present.
MRS BREEN (Gushingly.) Tremendously teapot! London's tea pot and I'm simply teapot all over me. (She rubs sides with him.) After the parlour mystery games and the crackers from the tree we sat on the staircase ottoman. Under the mistletoe. Two is company.
BLOOM (Wearing a purple Napoleon hat with an amber halfmoon, his fingers and thumbs passing slowly down to her soft moist meaty palm which she surrenders gently.) The witching hour of night. I took the splinter out of this hand, carefully, slowly. (Tenderly, as he slips on her finger a ruby ring.) L√† ci darem la mano.
MRS BREEN (In a onepiece eveningfrock executed in moonlight blue, a tinsel sylph's diadem on her brow with her dancecard fallen beside her moonblue satin slipper curves her palm softly, breathing quickly.) Voglio e non. You're hot! You're scalding! The left hand nearest the heart.
BLOOM When you made your present choice they said it was beauty and the beast. I can never forgive you for that. (His clenched fist at his brow.) Think what it means. All you meant to me then. (Hoarsely.) Woman, it's breaking me! (Dennis Breen, whitetallhatted, with Wisdom Hely's sandwich board, shuffles past them in cadet slippers, his dull beard thrust out, muttering to right and left. Little Alf Bergan, cloaked in the pall of the ace of spaces, dogs him to left and right, doubled in laughter.)
ALF BERGAN (Points jeering at the sandwich boards.) U.p.: Up.
MRS BREEN (To Bloom.) High jinks below stairs. (She gives him the glad eye.) Why didn't you kiss the spot to make it well? You wanted to.
BLOOM (Shocked.) Molly's best friend! Could you?
MRS BREEN (Her pulpy tongue between her lips, offers a pigeon kiss.) Hnhn. The answer is a lemon. Have you a little present for me there?
BLOOM (Off handedly.) Kosher. A snack for supper. The home without potted meat is incomplete. I was at Leah. Mrs Bandman Palmer. Trenchant exponent of Shakespeare. Unfortunately threw away the programme. Rattling good place round there for pig's feet. Feel.
(Richie Goulding, three ladies' hats pinned on his head, appears weighted to one side by the black legal bag of Collis and Ward on which a skull and crossbones are painted in white limewash. He ins it and shows it full of polonies, kippered, herrings, Findon haddies and tightpacked pills.)
RICHIE Best value in Dub.
(Bald Pat, bothered beetle, stands on the curbstone, folding his napkin, waiting to wait.)
PAT (Advances with a tilted dish of spillspilling gravy.) Steak and kidney. Bottle of lager. Hee hee hee. Wait till I wait.
RICHIE Goodgod. Inev erate inall...
(With hanging head he marches doggedly forward. The navvy, lurching by, gores him with his flaming pronghorn.)
RICHIE (With a cry of pain, his hand to his back) Ah! Bright's! Lights!
BLOOM (Points to the navvy.) A spy. Don't attract attention. I hate stupid crowds. I am not on pleasure bent. I am in a grave predicament.
MRS BREEN Humbugging and delutbering as per usual with your cock and bull story.
BLOOM I want to tell you a little secret about how I came to be here. But you must never tell. Not even Molly. I have a most particular reason.
MRS BREEN (All agog.) O, not for worlds.
BLOOM Let's walk on. Shall us?
MRS BREEN Let's.
(The bawd makes an unheeded sign. Bloom walks on with Mrs Breen. The terrier follows, whining piteously, wagging his tail.)
THE BAWD Jewman's melt!
BLOOM (In an oatmeal sporting suit, a sprig of woodbine in the lapel, tony buff shirt, shepherd's plaid Saint Andrew's cross scarftie, white spats, fawn dustcoat on his arm, tawny red brogues, fieldglasses in bandolier and a grey billycock hat.) Do you remember a long long time, years and years ago, just after Milly, Marionette we called her, was weaned when we all went together to Fairyhouse races, was it?
MRS BREEN (In smart Saxe tailormade, white velours hat and spider veil.) Leopardstown.
BLOOM I mean, Leopardstown. And Molly won seven shillings on a three year old named Nevertell and coming home along by Foxrock in that old fiveseater shanderadan of a waggonette you were in your heyday then and you had on that new hat of white velours with a surround of molefur that Mrs Hayes advised you to buy because it was marked down to nineteen and eleven, a bit of wire and an old rag of velveteen, and I'll lay you what you like she did it on purpose...
MRS BREEN She did, of course, the cat! Don't tell me! Nice adviser!
BLOOM Because it didn't suit you one quarter as well as the other ducky little tammy toque with the bird of paradise wing in it that I admired on you and you honestly looked just too fetching in it though it was a pity to kill it, you cruel creature, little mite of a thing with a heart the size of a fullstop.
MRS BREEN (Squeezes his arm, simpers.) Naughty cruel I was.
BLOOM (Low, secretly, ever more rapidly.) And Molly was eating a sandwich of spiced beef out of Mrs Joe Gallaher's lunch basket. Frankly, though she had her advisers or admirers, I never cared much for her style. She was .
MRS BREEN Too.
BLOOM Yes. And Molly was laughing because Rogers and Maggot O'Reilly were mimicking a cock as we passed a farmhouse and Marcus Tertius Moses, the tea merchant, drove past us in a gig with his daughter, Dancer Moses was her name, and the poodle in her lap bridled up and you asked me if I ever heard or read or knew or came across .
MRS BREEN (Eagerly.) Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
(She fades from his side. Followed by the whining dog he walks on towards hellsgates. In an archway a standing woman, bent forward, her feet apart, pisses cowily. Outside a shuttered pub a bunch of loiterers listen to a tale which their broken snouted gaffer rasps out with raucous humour. An armless pair of them flop wrestling, growling, in maimed sodden playfight.)
THE GAFFER (Crouches, his voice twisted in his snout.) And when Cairns came down from the scaffolding in Beaver Street what was he after doing it into only into the bucket of porter that was there waiting on the shavings for Derwan's plasterers.
THE LOITERERS (Guffaw with cleft palates.) O jays!
(Their paintspeckled hats wag. Spattered with size and lime of their lodges they frisk limblessly about him.)
BLOOM Coincidence too. They think it funny. Anything but that. Broad daylight. Trying to walk. Lucky no woman.
THE LOITERERS Jays, that's a good one. Glauber salts. O jays, into the men's porter.
(Bloom passes. Cheap whores, singly, coupled, shawled, dishevelled, call from lanes, doors, corners.)
THE WHORES Are you going far, queer fellow? How's your middle leg? Got a match on you? Eh, come here till I stiffen it for you.
(He plodges through their sump towards the lighted street beyond. From a bulge of window curtains a gramophone rears a battered brazen trunk. In the shadow a shebeenkeeper haggles with the navvy and the two redcoats.)
THE NAVVY (Belching.) Where's the bloody house?
THE SHEBEENKEEPER Purdon street. Shilling a bottle of stout. Respectable woman.
THE NAVVY (Gripping the two redcoats, staggers forward with them.) Come on, you British army!
PRIVATE CARR (Behind his back.) He aint half balmy.
PRIVATE COMPTON (LAughs.) What ho!
PRIVATE CARR (To the navvy.) Portobello barracks canteen. You ask for Carr. Just Carr.
THE NAVVY (Shouts.)
We are the boys. Of Wexford.
PRIVATE COMPTON Say! What price the sergeantmajor?
PRIVATE CARR Bennett? He's my pal. I love old Bennett.
THENAVVY (Shouts.)
The galling chain.
And free our native land.

(He staggers forward, dragging them with him. Bloom stops, at fault. The dog approaches, his tongue outlolling, panting.)
BLOOM Wildgoose chase this. Disorderly houses. Lord knows where they are gone. Drunks cover distance double quick. Nice mixup. Scene at Westland row. Then jump in first class with third ticket. Then too far. Train with engine behind. Might have taken me to Malahide or a siding for the night or collision. Second drink does it. Once is a dose. What am I following him for? Still, he's the best of that lot. If I hadn't heard about Mrs Beaufoy Purefoy I wouldn't have gone and wouldn't have met. Kismet. He'll lose that cash. Relieving office here. Good biz for cheapjacks, organs. What do ye lack? Soon got, soon gone. Might have lost my life too with that mangongwheeltracktrolleyglarejuggernaut only for presence of mind. Can't always save you, though. If I had passed Truelock's window that day two minutes later would have been shot. Absence of body. Still if bullet only went through my coat get damages for shock, five hundred pounds. What was he? Kildare street club toff. God help his gamekeeper.
(He gazes ahead reading on the wall a scrawled chalk legend Wet Dream and a phallic design.)
Odd! Molly drawing on the frosted carriagepane at Kingstown. What's that like? (Gaudy dollwomen loll in the lighted doorways, in window embrasures, smoking birdseye cigarettes. The odour of the sicksweet weed floats towards him in slow round ovalling wreaths.)
THE WREATHS Sweet are the sweets. Sweets of sin.
BLOOM My spine's a bit limp. Go or turn? And this food? Eat it and get all pigsticky. Absurd I am. Waste of money. One and eightpence too much. (The retriever drives a cold snivelling muzzle against his hand, wagging his tail.) Strange how they take to me. Even that brute today. Better speak to him first. Like women they like rencontres. Stinks like a polecat. Chacun son go√ªt. He might be mad. Fido. Uncertain in his movements. Good fellow! Garryowen! (The wolfdog sprawls on his back, wriggling obscenely with begging paws, his long black tongue lolling out.) Influence of his surroundings. Give and have done with it. Provided nobody. (Calling encouraging words he shambles back with a furtive poacher's tread, dogged by the setter into a dark stalestunk corner. He unrolls one parcel and goes to dump the crubeen softly but holds back and feels the trotter.) Sizeable for threepence. But then I have it in my left hand. Calls for more effort. Why? Smaller from want of use. O, let it slide. Two and six.
(With regret he lets unrolled crubeen and trotter slide. The mastiff mauls the bundle clumsily and gluts himself with growling greed, crunching the bones. Two raincaped watch approach, silent, vigilant. They murmur together.)
THE WATCH Bloom. Of Bloom. For Bloom. Bloom.
(Each lays a hand on Blooms shoulder.)
FIRST WATCH Caught in the act. Commit no nuisance.
BLOOM (Stammers.) I am doing good to others.
(A covey of gulls, storm petrels, rises hungrily from Liffey slime with Banbury cakes in their beaks.)
THE GULLS Kaw kave kankury kake.
BLOOM The friend of man. Trained by kindness.
(He points. Bob Doran, toppling from a high bars tool, sways over the munching spaniel.)
BOB DORAN Towser. Give us the paw. Give the paw.
(The bulldog growls, his scruff standing, a gobbet of pigs knuckle between his molars through which rabid scrumspittle dribbles. Bob Doran falls silently into an area.)
SECOND WATCH Prevention of cruelty to animals.
BLOOM (Enthusiastically.) A noble work! I scolded that tramdriver on Harold's cross bridge for illusing the poor horse with his harness scab. Bad French I got for my pains. Of course it was frosty and the last tram. All tales of circus life are highly demoralising.
(Signor Maffei, passion pale, in liontamer's costume with diamond studs in his shirtfront, steps forward, holding a circus paper hoop, a curling carriagewhip and a revolver with which he covers the going boarhound.)
SIGNOR MAFFEI (With a sinister smile.) Ladies and gentlemen, my educated greyhound. It was I broke in the bucking broncho Ajax with my patent spiked saddle for carnivores. Lash under the belly with a knotted thong. Block tackle and a strangling pully will bring your lion to heel, no matter how fractious, even Leo ferox there, the Libyan maneater.

SUNSET BOULEVARD, stencilled on a curbstope.
In the gutter lie dead leaves, scraps of paper,
burnt matches and cigarette butts.  It is early

Now the CAMERA leaves the sign and MOVES EAST, the
grey asphalt of the street filling the screen.  As
speed accelerates to around 40 m.p.h., traffic de-

A-8     JOE GILLIS' APARTMENT
It is a one-room affair with an unmade Murphy bed
pulled out of the wall at which Gillis sits typing.
There are a couple of worn-out plush chairs and a
Spanish-style, wrought-iron standing lamp.  Also a
small desk littered with books and letters, and a
chest of drawers with a portable phonograph and some
records on top.  On the walls are a couple of repro-
ductions of characterless paintings, with laundry
bills and snapshots stuck in the frames.  Through an
archway can he seen a tiny kitchenette, complete with
unwashed coffee pot and cup, empty tin cans, orange
peels, etc.  The effect is dingy and cheerless --
just another furnished apartment.  The buzzer SOUNDS.
GILLIS

The buzzer SOUNDS again.  Gillis gets up and opens

All right, Gillis.  You've got
five minutes.  What's your story
about?
GILLIS
It's about a ball player, a rookie
shortstop that's batting 347.  The
poor kid was once mixed up in a hold-
up.  But he's trying to go straight --
except there's a bunch of gamblers
who won't let him.
SHELDRAKE
So they tell the kid to throw the
World Series, or else, huh?
GILLIS
More or less.  Only for the end
I've got a gimmick that's real good.
A secretary enters, carrying a glass or milk.
She opens a drawer and takes out a bottle of pills for
Sheldrake.
SHELDRAKE
Got a title?
GILLIS
Bases Loaded.  There's a 4O-page
outline.
SHELDRAKE
(To the secretary)
Get the Readers' Department and
see what they have on Bases Loaded.
The secretary exits.  Sheldrake takes a pill and
washes it down with some milk.
GILLIS
They're pretty hot about it
over at Twentieth, but I
think Zanuck's all wet.  Can
you see Ty Power as a
GILLIS (cont'd)
shortstop?  You've got the best
man for it right here on this lot.
Alan Ladd.  Good change of pace for
Alan Ladd.  There's another thing:
it's pretty simple to shoot.  Lot
of outdoor stuff.  Bet you could
make the whole thing for under a
million.  And there's a great little
part for Bill Demarest.  One of the
trainers, an oldtime player who
got beaned and goes out of his head
sometimes.
The door opens and Betty Schaefer enters -- a clean-
cut, nice looking girl of 21, with a bright, alert
manner.  Dressed in tweed skirt, Brooks sweater and
pearls, and carrying a folder of papers.  She puts
them on Sheldrake's desk, not noticing Gillis, who
stands near the door.
BETTY
Hello, Mr. Sheldrake.  On that Bases
Loaded.  I covered it with a 2-page
synopsis.
(She holds it out)
But I wouldn't bother.
SHELDRAKE
What's wrong with it?
BETTY
It's from hunger.
SHELDRAKE
Nothing for Ladd?
BETTY
Just a rehash of something that
wasn't very good to begin with.
SHELDRAKE
I'm sure you'll be glad to meet
Mr. Gillis.  He wrote it.
Betty turns towards Gillis, embarrassed.
SHELDRAKE
This is Miss Kramer.
BETTY
Schaefer.  Betty Schaefer.  And
right now I wish I could crawl
into a hole and pull it in after
me.
GILLIS
If I could be of any help...
BETTY
I'm sorry, Mr. Gillis, but I
just don't think it's any good.
I found it flat and banal.
GILLIS
Exactly what kind of material do
you recommend?  James Joyce?
Dostoosvsky?
SHELDRAKE
Name dropper.
BETTY
I just think pictures should say
a little something.
GILLIS
Oh, you're one of the message
kids.  Just a story won't do.
You'd have turned down Gone With the
Wind.
SHELDRAKE
No, that was me.  I said, Who
wants to see a Civil War picture?
BETTY
Perhaps the reason I hated Bases
Loaded is that I knew your name.
I'd always heard you had some
talent.
GILLIS
That was last year.  This year
I'm trying to earn a living.
BETTY
So you take Plot 27-A, make it
glossy, make it slick --
SHELDRAKE
Carefull Those are dirty words!
You sound like a bunch of New
York critics.  Thank you, Miss
Schaefer.
BETTY
Goodbye, Mr. Gillis.
GILLIS
Goodbye.  Next time I'll write
The Naked and the Dead.

Betty leaves.
SHELDRAKE
Well, seems like Zanuck's got
himself a baseball picture.
GILLIS
Mr. Sheldrake, I don't want you
to think I thought this was going
to win any Academy Award.
SHELDRAKE
(His mind free-wheeling)
Of course, we're always looking
for a Betty Hutton.  Do you see
it as a Betty Hutton?
GILLIS
Frankly, no.
SHELDRAKE
(Amusing himself)
Now wait a minute.  If we made
it a girls' softball team, put
in a few numbers.  Might make a
cute musical: It Happened in
the Bull Pen -- the story of a
Woman.
GILLIS
You trying to be funny?  -- because
I'm all out of laughs.  I'm over a
barrel and I need a job.
SHELDRAKE
Sure, Gillis.  If something should
come along -
GILLIS
Along is no good.  I need it now.
SHELDRAKE
Haven't got a thing.
GILLIS
Any kind of assignment.  Additional
Dialogue.
SHELDRAKE
There's nothing, Gillis.  Not
even if you were a relative.
GILLIS
(Hating it)
Look, Mr. Sheldrake, could you
let me have three hundred bucks
yourself, as a personal loan?
SHELDRAKE
Could I?  Gillis, last year some-
body talked me into buying a ranch
in the valley.  So I borrowed money
from the bank so I could pay for
the ranch.  This year I had to
mortgage the ranch so I could keep
up my life insurance so I could
borrow on the insurance so I could
pay my income tax.  Now if Dewey
had been elected -
GILLIS
Goodbye, Mr. Sheldrake.

doing a lot of talking      naturally.  So then I

GILLIS' VOICE (Cont.)
Then I talked to a couple of
yes men at Twentieth.  To me
they said no.  Finally I
located that agent of mine, the
big faker.  Was he out digging
up a job for poor Joe Gillis?
Hmph! He was hard at work in
Bel Air, making with the golf
clubs.
Gillis hangs up with a curse, opens the door of the
booth, emerges, wiping the sweat from his forehead.
He walks toward the exit.  He is stopped by the
voice of
SKOLSKY
Hello, Gillis.
Gillis looks around.  At the fountain sits Skolsky,
drinking a cup of coffee.
GILLIS
Hello, Mr. Skolsky.
SKOLSKY
Got anything for the column?
GILLIS
Sure.  Just sold an original for
a hundred grand.  The Life of the
Warner Brothers.  Starring the Ritz
Brothers.  Playing opposite the
Andrew Sisters.
SKOLSKY
(With a sour smile)
But don't get me wrong -- I love
Hollywood.
Gillis walks out.
DISSOLVE TO:

A-14    THE BEL AIR GOLF LINKS
On a sun-dappled green edged with tall sycamores,
stands Morino, the agent, a caddy and a nondescript
opponent in the background.  Gillis has evidently
stated his problem already.

MORINO
So you need three hundred dollars?
Of course, I could give you three
hundred dollars.  Only I'm not
going to.
GILLIS
No?
MORINO
Gillis, get this through your
head.  I'm not just your agent.
It's not the ten per cent.  I'm
your friend.
He sinks his putt and walks toward the next tee,
Gillis following him.
GILLIS
How's that about your being my
friend?
MORINO
Don't you know the finest things
in the world have been written on
an empty stomach?  Once a talent
like yours gets into that Mocambo-
Romanoff rut, you're through.
GILLIS
Forget Romanoff's.  It's the car
I'm talking about.  If I lose my
car it's like having my legs out off.
MORINO
Greatest thing that could happen
to you.  Now you'll have to sit
behind that typewriter.  Now
you'll have to write.
GILLIS
What do you think I've been doing?
I need three hundred dollars.
MORINO
(Icily)
Maybe what you need is another agent.
He bends down to tee up his ball.  Gillis turns away.

at the steering wheel and manages to turn the careening
car into
A-23    A DRIVEWAY
It is overgrown with weeds and screened from the street

feet from the street and looks back.

Behind a bamboo blind there is a movement of
a dark figure.
WOMAN'S VOICE
Wlly are you so late?  Why have
you kept me waitlng so long?
A-29    GILLIS
He stands flabbergasted.  A new noise attracts his
attention -- the creak of a heavy metal-and-glass
door being opened.  He turns and sees
A-3O    THE ENTRANCE DOOR OF THE HOUSE
Max von Mayerling stands there.  He is sixty, and
all in black, except for immaculate white cotton
gloves, shirt, high, stiff collar and a white bow
tie.  His coat is shiny black alpaca, his trousers
ledger-atriped.  He is semi-paralyzed.  The left
side of his mouth is pulled down, and he leans on a
rubber-ferruled stick.
MAX
In here!
Gillis enters the shot.

GILLIS
I just put my car in the garage.
I had a blow-out.  I thought --
MAX
Go on in.
There is authority in the gesture of his white-
gloved hand as he motions Gillis inside.
GILLIS
Look, maybe I'd better take my
car --
MAX
Wipe your feet!
Automatically, Gillis wipes his feet on an enormous
shabby cocoanut mat.
MAX
You are not dressed properly.
GILLIS
Dressed for what?
THE WOMAN'S VOICE
Max!  Have him come up, Max!
MAX
(Gesturing)
Up the stairs!
GILLIS
Suppose you listen just for a
minute -
MAX
Madame is waiting.
GILLIS
For me?  Okay.
Gillis enters.

A-31    INT. NORMA DESMOND'S ENTRANCE HALL
It is grandiose and grim.  The whole place is one of
those abortions of silent-picture days, with bowling
alleys in the cellar and a built-in pipe organ, and
beams imported from Italy, with California termites
at work on them.  Portieres are drawn before all the
windows, and only thin slits or sunlight find their
way in to fight the few electric bulbs which are always
burning.

Gillis starts up the curve of the black marble
staircase.  It has a wrought-iron rail and a worn
velvet rope along the wall.
MAX
(From below)
If you need help with the
coffin call me.
The oddity of the situation has caught Gillis'
imagination.  He climbs the stairs with a kind of
morbid fascination.  At the top he stops, undecided,
then turns to the right and is stopped by
WOMAN'S VOICE
This way!
Gillis swings around.
Norma Desmond stands down the corridor next to a
doorway from which emerges a flickering light.  She
is a little woman.  There is a curious style, a
great sense of high voltage about her.  She is dress-
ed in black house pyjamas and black high-heeled
pumps.  Around her throat there is a leopard-pat-
terned scarf, and wound around her head a turban of
the same material.  Her skin is very pale, and she
is wearing dark glasses.
NORMA
In here.  I put him on my massage
table in front of the fire.  He
always liked fires and poking at
them with a stick.
Gillis enters the SHOT and she leads him into

A-32    NORMA DESMOND'S BEDROOM
It is a huge, gloomy room hung in white brocade which
has beconle dirty over the years and even slightly
torn in a few places.  There's a great, unmade gilded
bed in the shape of a swan, from which the gold had
begun to peel.  There is a disorder of clothes and
negligees and faded photographs of old-time stars
about.
In an imitation baroque fireplace some logs are burn-
ing.  On the massage table before it lies a small
form shrouded under a Spanish shawl.  At each end on
a baroque pedestal stands a three-branched cande-
labrum, the candles lighted.
NORMA
I've made up my mind we'll bury him in
the garden.  Any city laws against that?

GILLIS
I wouldn't know.
NORMA
I don't care anyway.  I want the
coffin to be white.  And I want
it specially lined with satin.
White, or deep pink.
She picks up the shawl to make up her mind about the
color.  From under the shawl flops down a dead arm.
Gillis stares and recoils a little.  It is like a
child's arm, only black and hairy.
NORMA
Maybe red.  bright flaming red.
Gay.  Let's make it gay.
Gillis edges closer and glances down.  Under the
shawl he sees the sad, bearded face of a dead
chimpanzee.  Norma drops back the shawl.
NORMA
How much will it be?  I warn you -
don't give me a fancy price just
because I'm rich.
GILLIS
Lady.  you've got the wrong man.
For the first time.  Norma really looks at him
through her dark glasses.
GILLIS
I had some trouble with my car.
Flat tire.  I pulled into your
garage till I could get a spare.
I thought this was an empty house.
NORMA
It is not.  Get out.
GILLIS
I'm sorry, and I'm sorry you lost
your friend, and I don't think red
is the right color.
NORMA
Get out.
GILLIS
Sure.  Wait a minute -- haven't
I seen you -- ?

NORMA
Or shall I call my servant?
GILLIS
I know your face.  You're Norma
Desmond.  You used to be in
pictures.  You used to be big.
NORMA
I am big.  It's the pictures
that got small.
GILLIS
I knew there was something
wrong with them.
NORMA
They're dead.  They're finished.
There was a time when this busi-
ness had the eyes of the whole
wide world.  But that wasn't good
enough.  Oh, nol They wanted the
ears of the world, too.  So they
opened their big mouths, and out
came talk, talk, talk...
GILLIS
That's where the popcorn business
comes in.  You buy yourself a bag
and plug up your ears.
NORMA
Look at them in the front offices --
the master minds! They took the
idols and smashed them.  The
Fairbankses and the Chaplins and
the Gilberts and the Valentinos.
And who have they got now?  Some
nobodies -- a lot of pale little
frogs croaking pish-poshl
GILLIS
Don't get sore at me.  I'm not
an executive.  I'm just a writer.
NORMA
You are! Writing words, words!
You've made a rope of words and
strangled this businessl But there
is a microphone right there to catch
the last gurgles, and Technicolor
to photograph the red, swollen tongue!

GILLIS
Ssh! You'll wake up that monkey.
NORMA
Get out!
Gillis starts down the stairs.
GILLIS
Next time I'll bring my autograph
album along, or maybe a hunk of
cement and ask for your footprints.
He is halfway down the staircase when he is
stopped by
NORMA
Just a minute, you!
GILLIS
Yeah?
NORMA
You're a writer, you said.
GILLIS
Why?
Norma starts down the stairs.
NORMA
Are you or aren't you?
GILLIS
I think that's what it says on my
driver's license.
NORMA
And you have written pictures,
haven't you?
GILLIS
Sure have.  The last one I
wrote was about cattle rustlers.
Before they were through with it,
the whole thing played on a
torpedo boat.
Norma has reached him at the bottom of the staircase.
NORMA
I want to ask you something.
Come in here.
She leads him into

A-33    THE HUGE LIVING ROOM
It is dark and damp and filled with black oak and
red velvet furniture which looks like crappy props
from the Mark of Zorro set.  Along the main wall,
a gigantic fireplace has been freezing for years.
On the gold piano is a galaxy of photographs of
Norma Desmond in her various roles.  On one wall
is a painting -- a California Gold Rush scene,
Carthay Circle school.  (We will learn later that
it hides a motion picture screen.)
One corner is filled with a large pipe organ, and
as Norma and Gillis enter, there is a grizzly
moaning sound.  Gillis looks around.
NORMA
The wind gets in that blasted
pipe organ.  I ought to have
it taken out.
GILLIS
Or teach it a better tune.
Norma has led him to the card tables which stand
side by side near a window.  They are piled high
with papers scrawled in a large, uncertain hand.
NORMA
How long is a movie script these
days?  I mean, how many pages?
GILLIS
Depends on what it is -- a Donald
Duck or Joan or Arc.
NORMA
This is to be a very important
picture.  I have written it
myself.  Took me years.
GILLIS
(Looking at the piles
of script)
Looks like enough for six impor-
tant pictures.
NORMA
It's the story or Salome.  I
think I'll have DeMille direct it.
GILLIS
Uh-huh.

NORMA
We've made a lot of pictures
together.
GILLIS
And you'll play Salome?
NORMA
Who else ?
GILLIS
Only asking.  I did't know
you were planning a comeback.
NORMA
I hate that word.  It is a return.
A return to the millions of people
who have never forgiven me for
deserting the screen.
GILLIS
Fair enough.
NORMA
Salome -- what a woman! What a
part! The Princess in love with
a Holy man.  She dances the Dance
of the Seven Veils.  He rejects
her, so she demands his head on a
golden tray, kissing his cold, dead
lips.
GILLIS
They'll love it in Pomona.
NORMA
(Taking it straight)
They will love it every place.
(She reaches for a
batch of pages from
the heap)
Read it.  Read the scene just
before she has him killed!
GILLIS
Right now?  Never let another
writer read your stuff.  He
may steal it.
NORMA
I am not afraid.  Read it!
NORMA (Cont'd)
(Calling)
Max!  Max!
(To Gillis)
Sit down.  Is there enough light?
GILLIS
I've got twenty-twenty vision.
Max has entered.
NORMA
Bring something to drink.
MAX
Yes.  Madame.
He leaves.  Norma turns to Gillis again.
NORMA
I said sit down.
There is compulsion in her voice.
Gillis looks at her                   GILLIS' VOICE

begging me in her own proud
way to like it.  It meant
so much to her...

NORMA

Well?
GILLIS
This is fascinating.
NORMA
Of course it is.
GILLIS
Maybe it's a little long and
maybe there are some repetitions...
but you're not a professional
writer.
NORMA
I wrote that with my heart.
GILLIS
Sure you did.  That's what makes
it great.  What it needs is a
little more dialogue.
NORMA
What for?  I can say anything I
want with my eyes.
GILLIS
It certainly could use a pair of

I will not have it butchered.
GILLIS
Of course not.  But it ought to
be organized.  Just an editing
job.  You can find somebody.
NORMA
Who?  I'd have to have somebody
I can trust.  When were you born --
I mean, what sign of the zodiac?
GILLIS
I don't know.
NORMA
What month?
GILLIS
December twenty-first.
NORMA
Sagittarius.  I like Sagittarians.
You can trust them.
GILLIS
Thank you.
NORMA
I want you to do this work.
GILLIS
Me?  I'm busy.  Just finished
one script.  I'm due on another
assignment.
NORMA
I don't care.

GILLIS
You know, I'm pretty expensive.
I get five hundred a week.
NORMA
I wouldn't worry about money.
I'll make it worth your while.

To see what I could see
My black shroud
Holding down my feelings
A pillar for my enemies
I should have wrote a letter
And grieve what I happen to grieve
My black shroud
I never trust my feelings

When I was three, three, maybe four
She left us at that video store
Oh, be my rest, be my fantasy

I‚Äôm light as a feather
I‚Äôm bright as the Oregon breeze

Frightened by my feelings

No, I‚Äôm not a go-getter

I should have wrote a letter
Explaining what I feel, that empty feeling
Don‚Äôt back down, concentrate on seeing
The breakers in the bar, the neighbor‚Äôs greeting
My brother had a daughter
The beauty that she brings, illumination
Don‚Äôt back down, there is nothing left

Hey, I'm not afraid, I can be myself and I
Hope you can be yourself as well, 'cause I can make you feel alright
And there was so much happiness that we were still yet to find
I said that you can call me Alex, baby, welcome to my life

(But don't you worry, don't you, don't worry girl)
No, I'm not sure if I'm into you
The last time that you checked, I was probably so sad and confused
(I don't know, no, I don't know what you like)
But if you're looking for something new
I know somebody that you could choose

What about me?
What about me?
What about me and you together?
Something that could really last forever

Maybe I should go outside so I could get a fucking life
I made a friend and she spent the night, and now

(I'm in love and she remains in my life)
Back when we spoke in Europe
I need insurance on my emotions
I can't get hurt again
(Fuck the past, fuck them, they all made me sad)
And I had no time to prepare to face my fears
I guess that it's time that I dried these tears

But if I could just be happy by the end of this song
But if by the time you hear it, you are already gone
And it didn't go to plan
Then why should I continue in this life
When there's no one around to be the one who makes me smile?

See I'm another broken teen with low self esteem
Since the age of 13 I was on the street scene
Stealin' cars and robbing ya house to get C.R.E.A.M
Now to make my family proud is my only dream
Then started slangin' rocks off to the fiends
Dad I'm sorry that you had to have a crook for a son
But don't worry bruh I've given that shit up
So I guess that I've won all the shit that I've done
Stealing change out ya car for some bud just to have fun
Cruisin' down ya street as it goes bop bop
There's not need to act tough no need to act up yeah
But I'm rising above that shit
Ya better watch it better get with it
Greedy cunts only in it when there's something for them
Used to always have a 3 stick mix pulled out the stem
Always rockin' it in the booth with Shem

And if you start beef we'll be runnin' through ya door
Smokin' on the buds and I roll a fat ace
There's so many busta's I'mma case a case

Valied up move more dots

Cruisin' 'round here red as fuck so you know it's hot
Doin' shit for crime is to get paid and get laid
But don't worry cuz 'cause I'm outta the game yeah

You booked the night train for a reason
So you could sit there in this hurt
Bustling crowds or silent sleepers
You're not sure which is worse

Because I dropped your hand while dancing
Left you‚Åüout‚Åüthere‚Åüstanding
Crestfallen on the‚Åülanding
Champagne problems
Your mom's‚Åüring in your pocket
My picture in your wallet
Your heart was glass, I dropped it
Champagne problems

You told your family for a reason
You couldn't keep it in
Your sister splashed out on the bottle
Now no one's celebrating

Dom P√©rignon, you brought it
No crowd of friends applauded
Your hometown skeptics called it
Champagne problems
You had a speech, you're speechless
Love slipped beyond your reaches
And I couldn't give a reason

Sometimes you just don't know the answer
'Til someone's on their knees and asks you
""She would've made such a lovely bride
What a shame she's fucked in the head,"" they said
But you'll find the real thing instead
She'll patch up your tapestry that I shred

And hold your hand while dancing
Never leave you standing

With one foot in the past now, just how long will it last?
No, no, no, have you no ambition?

I guess I should stop looking out for you like I always do

Instead of leaving me staring at my shoes?
It's just the way you're glancing at me
Something about you just makes me feel guilty for liking you
When you're with him, when you're with him

This is a love song for a girl who will never know it's about her
I know it's pretty stupid, but I'm much too shy to tell her
She's beaming that smile, all the while
I'm all choked up on my own throat, I guess there is no hope

And we're walking out in the snow, I say, ""I guess I should go""
And we're talking 'bout someone else
When we should be talking about ourselves
It's the same old situation, you've always got me waiting
Come on, dear, I think time's a-wastin'
Before we have to go back inside and return to our normal lives

And it‚Äôs still early.
An unbridled riff of a song, ‚ÄúGirls Got Rhythm‚Äù is given ballsy swagger by an unhinged yet committed vocal from the helium-voiced Scott, propelled excitedly by the Youngs‚Äô riffing and Williams‚Äô eighth-notes. Two songs in and you can hear the difference that Lange has made: light virtually glints off of the shiny surface of this performance, so tactile is the mid-range, so compactly-made and energetically focused is the performance. An aspect of earlier records that Lange seems to have vetoed is the recording of the room‚Äôs atmosphere, studio details such as amp feedback, fingers on live strings, studio count-ins. In doing so he might‚Äôve lost a bit of the band‚Äôs immediacy, but he compensated for it with an air-tight but punchy‚Äîand radio-ready‚Äîalbum sound. I can never think of ‚ÄúGirls Got Rhythm‚Äù without pairing it with the opening track, and when the album was released the two were usually played back-to-back on DC101 where I lived, and on hundreds of FM stations around the country. A perpetual motion machine, ‚ÄúGirls Got Rhythm‚Äù was made equally for boom-boxes at the public pool and for pounding systems in the back of cars transporting happily juiced-up guys downtown for a Friday night out.
Lyrically, Scott was mining his favorite source of inspiration. I thought that I knew who these girls with the backseat rhythm were, the ones who looked through me at school, the ones who after three o‚Äôclock would shed their regulation plaid skirt, white blouse, and saddle shoes to paint-on their makeup, feather their Sun-In hair and, defying the laws of physics, stuff a hairbrush down the ass pocket of their skin-tight Calvin Kleins to hang out and smoke at the park in Kemp Mill shopping center or the ice skating rink at Wheaton Regional, flirting with guys who were already shaving. Or: those prohibited girls at E. Brook Lee, the public school located over the hill feet away from St. Andrews, but culturally a continent-sized distance. When Scott sings about the girl moving like sin and then letting him in, the colloquialisms worked well enough for us boys, giddily tense as we were with the twin pulls of piety and up-skirt peeking. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like liquid love,‚Äù Bon squeals, barely suppressing the grin that knows just how outrageous the line is.
The band is fantastically loud and tight by the end of the song, Malcolm the foreman steering the sassy, smirking riff as Williams and Rudd provide the solid chassis. Rock & roll rhythm! the guys shout seconds from the song‚Äôs end, and it‚Äôs that moment that I loved when I first heard the tune; these girls don‚Äôt just hang out in the back seat, they‚Äôre silhouettes for everything that rock & roll promises.
To young guys, at least. Bon Scott‚Äôs lyrics catalogue an epic sweep through the triumvirate of men‚Äôs needs: pussy; rock & roll; drink. There‚Äôs little room in his oeuvre for fealty, or subtlety, or sensitivity to the nuances of the male-female relationship dynamic, or for extended reflection on the tension between desire and conscience, surrender and smarts. There shouldn‚Äôt be. He knows what he wants, we know what he wants, she knows what he wants. The music makes it irresistibly so.
But that doesn‚Äôt mean that, Catholic-trained, I didn‚Äôt raise an eyebrow at some of Scott‚Äôs lyrics, even when as a hopeless teenager the language I spoke was equal parts English and Hormone. When Highway to Hell appeared in the summer of 1979 I had sex on the brain. The previous summer, the Rolling Stones had released Some Girls, and ‚ÄúMiss You‚Äù was in heavy-rotation on D.C.-area radio stations. Laying out at Wheaton Pool in the radiant, suburban sunshine, off of school for a few months, heady with the thump of ‚ÄúMiss You‚Äù‚Äôs filthy beat and the surrounding tableau of girls moist with Coppertone, the enduring, insistent tradition of rock & roll and sex was working its lasting way through me, and I was happily helpless in its grip. (That my 16-year old sister was among those innocently posing against the backdrop only complicated the pleasures.)  Buzzing in the air the next few summers was the rumor that Joan Jett had gone to Wheaton High School a few years earlier and she comes to the pool sometimes! (She had indeed gone to Wheaton High. I looked eagerly for her bad reputation to strut onto the pool deck area in those years, but she never materialized.)  There was sex in the breezes and the shimmering girl-curves and though I hardly had much of it figured out or even named, the throb of ‚ÄúMiss You‚Äù (and of Exile‚Äôs ‚ÄúKiss You All Over‚Äù and Nick Gilder‚Äôs ‚ÄúHot Child in the City‚Äù and Foreigner‚Äôs ‚ÄúHot Blooded‚Äù) pulsed in my chest as a girl walked by me on her way to the snack stand and I rubbed my eyes and rising through the eyespots and glare was the mythic, long-off promise of sex.
Bon Scott was writing out of a tradition that we might charitably call the Penthouse School of Realism, but he was also writing within the time-tested conventions of Dirty Blues (no doubt with autobiographical inspiration‚Äîwitness ‚ÄúWhole Lotta Rosie,‚Äù ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs Got Balls,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Jack,‚Äù ‚ÄúGo Down,‚Äù et al). He‚Äôs hardly the first or the last musician to mine the blues for lyrical tropes as well as for chord changes, but his knowing humor and knack for memorable turns-of-phrase made him one of the best rock & roll lyricists of his era. ‚ÄúPeople began singing about sex as soon as they began singing,‚Äù writes rock & roll historian Jim Marshall. ‚ÄúDirty ballads, lewd couplets, poems, limericks, rhymes, drinking songs, all ripe with sex, have always been an important if shunned part of western culture, from the first broadside balladeers to the most current heavy metal acts.‚Äù  He adds, ‚ÄúBlues in general is a lyrically limited form‚Äîbroads, booze and sex have a virtual stranglehold on the primitive blues singers‚Äô mind, give or take a cameo appearance by the devil himself‚Ä¶and filthy blues records make up a large portion of the recorded body of work. Since that immortal day when Blind Lemon Jefferson beheld his pecker and decided it had the same leathery quality as a black snake, getting the biggest hit record of his career out of it‚Äî‚ÄúBlack Snake Moan‚Äù (which he recorded several times)‚Äîsex on blues discs sold.‚Äù
What Marshall calls ‚Äúthe golden age of the double entendre and the crude metaphor‚Äù never ended, of course. From obscure 1950s R&B singers to Seventies hard rock to daring New Wave through last month‚Äôs R&B and Hip Hop: popular music has always made room for gutter thought, memorably expressed. A sliver of history‚Äôs badly behaved: Barrel House Annie‚Äôs ‚ÄúIf It Don‚Äôt Fit (Don‚Äôt Force It);‚Äù Lil Johnson‚Äôs ‚ÄúSam‚ÄîThe Hot Dog Man;‚Äù Art Fowler and his Ukulele‚Äôs ‚ÄúNo Wonder She‚Äôs A Blushing Bride;‚Äù Louise Bogan‚Äôs infamous ‚ÄúShave ‚ÄòEm Dry;‚Äù Bo Diddley‚Äôs ‚ÄúGreatest Lover in the World;‚Äù the Sonics‚Äô ‚ÄúDirty Old Man;‚Äù the Vandals‚Äô really racy mid-Sixties ode to a one-night stand ‚ÄúI Saw Her In a Mustang;‚Äù Grand Funk Railroad‚Äôs paen to groupies, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre An American Band,‚Äù Naughty by Nature‚Äôs catchy, acronymic ‚ÄúO.P.P.‚Äù  Etcetera, etcetera. Guilty even were the tidy Everly Brothers, whose ‚ÄúWake Up Little Susie,‚Äù duly sanitized for Eisenhower‚Äôs America, nails the morning-after fears of a teenage couple waking up where they shouldn‚Äôt be. Common to these and other grinding songs are reliance on witty metaphors and an understanding that the listener‚Äôs in on the (dirty) joke. When Wynonie Harris sings ‚ÄúKeep on churning until the butter comes‚Äù or Bon howls about being ‚Äúup to my neck in you,‚Äù you don‚Äôt have to have a second pair of eyes in the back of your head to see in two directions at once.
‚ÄúThere were always ways in which popular singers could be suggestive of sexual desire by subtle emphasis or inference,‚Äù blues historian Paul Oliver says. In the fall of 1979, as Highway to Hell was laying the foundation for its assault on the charts, the Knack were selling millions of copies of  ‚ÄúMy Sharona,‚Äù and later ‚ÄúGood Girls Don‚Äôt,‚Äù teaching suburban kids everywhere burdened with teeenage madness and in-between sadness the Top 40 code for oral sex. She really got the rhythm.8Embed",en,LABEL_0,0.5356742143630981,LABEL_1,0.46432581543922424

¬†¬†¬†That day, as for some days past, Saint-Loup had been obliged to go to Donci√®res, where, until his leave finally expired, he would be on duty now until late every afternoon. I was sorry that he was not at Balbec. I had seen alight from carriages and pass, some into the ball-room of the Casino, others into the ice-cream shop, young women who at a distance had seemed to me lovely. I was passing through one of those periods of our youth, unprovided with any one definite love, vacant, in which at all times and in all places ‚Äî as a lover the woman by whose charms he is smitten ‚Äî we desire, we seek, we see Beauty. Let but a single real feature ‚Äî the little that one distinguishes of a woman seen from afar or from behind ‚Äî enable us to project the form of beauty before our eyes, we imagine that we have seen her before, our heart beats, we hasten in pursuit, and will always remain half-persuaded that it was she, provided that the woman has vanished: it is only if we manage to overtake her that we realise our mistake
¬†¬†¬†Besides, as I grew more and more delicate, I was inclined to overrate the simplest pleasures because of the difficulties that sprang up in the way of my attaining them. Charming women I seemed to see all round me, because I was too tired, if it was on the beach, too shy if it was in the Casino or at a pastry-cook‚Äôs, to go anywhere near them. And yet if I was soon to die I should have liked first to know the appearance at close quarters, in reality of the prettiest girls that life had to offer, even although it should be another than myself or no one at all who was to take advantage of the offer. (I did not, in fact, appreciate the desire for possession that underlay my curiosity.) I should have had the courage to enter the ballroom if Saint-Loup had been with me. Left by myself, I was simply hanging about in front of the Grand Hotel until it was time for me to join my grandmother, when, still almost at the far end of the paved ‚Äòfront‚Äô along which they projected in a discordant spot of colour, I saw coming towards me five or six young girls, as different in appearance and manner from all the people whom one was accustomed to see at Balbec as could have been, landed there none knew whence, a flight of gulls which performed with measured steps upon the sands ‚Äî the dawdlers using their wings to overtake the rest ‚Äî a movement the purpose of which seems as obscure to the human bathers, whom they do not appear to see, as it is clearly determined in their own birdish minds
¬†¬†¬†One of these strangers was pushing as she came, with one hand, her bicycle; two others carried golf-clubs; and their attire generally was in contrast to that of the other girls at Balbec, some of whom, it was true, went in for games, but without adopting any special outfit
¬†¬†¬†It was the hour at which ladies and gentlemen came out every day for a turn on the ‚Äòfront,‚Äô exposed to the merciless fire of the long glasses fastened upon them, as if they had each borne some disfigurement which she felt it her duty to inspect in its minutest details, by the chief magistrate‚Äôs wife, proudly seated there with her back to the band-stand, in the middle of that dread line of chairs on which presently they too, actors turned critics, would come and establish themselves, to scrutinise in their turn those others who would then be filing past them. All these people who paced up and down the ‚Äòfront,‚Äô tacking as violently as if it had been the deck of a ship (for they could not lift a leg without at the same time waving their arms, turning their heads and eyes, settling their shoulders, compensating by a balancing movement on one side for the movement they had just made on the other, and puffing out their faces), and who, pretending not to see so as to let it be thought that they were not interested, but covertly watching, for fear of running against the people who were walking beside or coming towards them, did, in fact, butt into them, became entangled with them, because each was mutually the object of the same secret attention veiled beneath the same apparent disdain; their love ‚Äî and consequently their fear ‚Äî of the crowd being one of the most powerful motives in all men, whether they seek to please other people or to astonish them, or to shew them that they despise them. In the case of the solitary, his seclusion, even when it is absolute and ends only with life itself, has often as its primary cause a disordered love of the crowd, which so far overrules every other feeling that, not being able to win, when he goes out, the admiration of his hall-porter, of the passers-by, of the cabman whom he hails, he prefers not to be seen by them at all, and with that object abandons every activity that would oblige him to go out of doors
¬†¬†¬†Among all these people, some of whom were pursuing a train of thought, but if so betrayed its instability by spasmodic gestures, a roving gaze as little in keeping as the circumspect titubation of their neighbours, the girls whom I had noticed, with that mastery over their limbs which comes from perfect bodily condition and a sincere contempt for the rest of humanity, were advancing straight ahead, without hesitation or stiffness, performing exactly the movements that they wished to perform, each of their members in full independence of all the rest, the greater part of their bodies preserving that immobility which is so noticeable in a good waltzer. They were now quite near me. Although each was a type absolutely different from the others, they all had beauty; but to tell the truth I had seen them for so short a time, and without venturing to look them straight in the face, that I had not yet individualised any of them. Save one, whom her straight nose, her dark complexion pointed in contrast among the rest, like (in a renaissance picture of the Epiphany) a king of Arab cast, they were known to me only, one by a pair of eyes, hard, set and mocking; another by cheeks in which the pink had that coppery tint which makes one think of geraniums; and even of these points I had not yet indissolubly attached any one to one of these girls rather than to another; and when (according to the order in which their series met the eye, marvellous because the most different aspects came next one another, because all scales of colours were combined in it, but confused as a piece of music in which I should not have been able to isolate and identify at the moment of their passage the successive phrases, no sooner distinguished than forgotten) I saw emerge a pallid oval, black eyes, green eyes, I knew not if these were the same that had already charmed me a moment ago, I could not bring them home to any one girl whom I might thereby have set apart from the rest and so identified. And this want, in my vision, of the demarcations which I should presently establish between them sent flooding over the group a wave of harmony, the continuous transfusion of a beauty fluid, collective and mobile
¬†¬†¬†It was not perhaps, in this life of ours, mere chance that had, in forming this group of friends, chosen them all of such beauty; perhaps these girls (whose attitude was enough to reveal their nature, bold, frivolous and hard), extremely sensitive to everything that was ludicrous or ugly, incapable of yielding to an intellectual or moral attraction, had naturally felt themselves, among companions of their own age, repelled by all those in whom a pensive or sensitive disposition was betrayed by shyness, awkwardness, constraint, by what, they would say,‚Äòdidn‚Äôt appeal‚Äô to them, and from such had held aloof; while they attached themselves, on the other hand, to others to whom they were drawn by a certain blend of grace, suppleness, and physical neatness, the only form in which they were able to picture the frankness of a seductive character and the promise of pleasant hours in one another‚Äôs company. Perhaps, too, the class to which they belonged, a class which I should not have found it easy to define, was at that point in its evolution at which, whether thanks to its growing wealth and leisure, or thanks to new athletic habits, extended now even to certain plebeian elements, and a habit of physical culture to which had not yet been added the culture of the mind, a social atmosphere, comparable to that of smooth and prolific schools of sculpture, which have not yet gone in for tortured expressions, produces naturally and in abundance fine bodies with fine legs, fine hips, wholesome and reposeful faces, with an air of agility and guile. And were they not noble and calm models of human beauty that I beheld there, outlined against the sea, like statues exposed to the sunlight upon a Grecian shore?
¬†¬†¬†Just as if, in the heart of their band, which progressed along the ‚Äòfront‚Äô like a luminous comet, they had decided that the surrounding crowd was composed of creatures of another race whose sufferings even could not awaken in them any sense of fellowship, they appeared not to see them, forced those who had stopped to talk to step aside, as though from the path of a machine that had been set going by itself, so that it was no good waiting for it to get out of their way, their utmost sign of consciousness being when, if some old gentleman of whom they did not admit the existence and thrust from them the contact, had fled with a frightened or furious, but a headlong or ludicrous motion, they looked at one another and smiled. They had, for whatever did not form part of their group, no affectation of contempt; their genuine contempt was sufficient. But they could not set eyes on an obstacle without amusing themselves by crossing it, either in a running jump or with both feet together, because they were all filled to the brim, exuberant with that youth which we need so urgently to spend that even when we are unhappy or unwell, obedient rather to the necessities of our age than to the mood of the day, we can never pass anything that can be jumped over or slid down without indulging ourselves conscientiously, interrupting, interspersing our slow progress ‚Äî as Chopin his most melancholy phrase ‚Äî with graceful deviations in which caprice is blended with virtuosity. The wife of an elderly banker, after hesitating between various possible exposures for her husband, had settled him on a folding chair, facing the ‚Äòfront,‚Äô sheltered from wind and sun by the band-stand. Having seen him comfortably installed there, she had gone to buy a newspaper which she would read aloud to him, to distract him ‚Äî one of her little absences which she never prolonged for more than five minutes, which seemed long enough to him but which she repeated at frequent intervals so that this old husband on whom she lavished an attention that she took care to conceal, should have the impression that he was still quite alive and like other people and was in no need of protection. The platform of the band-stand provided, above his head, a natural and tempting springboard, across which, without a moment‚Äôs hesitation, the eldest of the little band began to run; she jumped over the terrified old man, whose yachting cap was brushed by the nimble feet, to the great delight of the other girls, especially of a pair of green eyes in a ‚Äòdashing‚Äô face, which expressed, for that bold act, an admiration and a merriment in which I seemed to discern a trace of timidity, a shamefaced and blustering timidity which did not exist in the others. ‚ÄúOh, the poor old man; he makes me sick; he looks half dead;‚Äù said a girl with a croaking voice, but with more sarcasm than sympathy. They walked on a little way, then stopped for a moment in the middle of the road, with no thought whether they were impeding the passage of other people, and held a council, a solid body of irregular shape, compact, unusual and shrill, like birds that gather on the ground at the moment of flight; then they resumed their leisurely stroll along the ‚Äòfront,‚Äô against a background of sea
¬†¬†¬†By this time their charming features had ceased to be indistinct and impersonal. I had dealt them like cards into so many heaps to compose (failing their names, of which I was still ignorant) the big one who had jumped over the old banker; the little one who stood out against the horizon of sea with her plump and rosy cheeks, her green eyes; the one with the straight nose and dark complexion, in such contrast to all the rest; another, with a white face like an egg on which a tiny nose described an arc of a circle like a chicken‚Äôs beak; yet another, wearing a hooded cape (which gave her so poverty-stricken an appearance, and so contradicted the smartness of the figure beneath that the explanation which suggested itself was that this girl must have parents of high position who valued their self-esteem so far above the visitors to Balbec and the sartorial elegance of their own children that it was a matter of the utmost indifference to them that their daughter should stroll on the ‚Äòfront‚Äô dressed in a way which humbler people would have considered too modest); a girl with brilliant, laughing eyes and plump, colourless cheeks, a black polo-cap pulled down over her face, who was pushing a bicycle with so exaggerated a movement of her hips, with an air borne out by her language, which was so typically of the gutter and was being shouted so loud, when I passed her (although among her expressions I caught that irritating ‚Äòlive my own life‚Äô) that, abandoning the hypothesis which her friend‚Äôs hooded cape had made me construct, I concluded instead that all these girls belonged to the population which frequents the racing-tracks, and must be the very juvenile mistresses of professional bicyclists. In any event, in none of my suppositions was there any possibility of their being virtuous. At first sight ‚Äî in the way in which they looked at one another and smiled, in the insistent stare of the one with the dull cheeks ‚Äî I had grasped that they were not. Besides, my grandmother had always watched over me with a delicacy too timorous for me not to believe that the sum total of the things one ought not to do was indivisible or that girls who were lacking in respect for their elders would suddenly be stopped short by scruples when there were pleasures at stake more tempting than that of jumping over an octogenarian
¬†¬†¬†Though they were now separately identifiable, still the mutual response which they gave one another with eyes animated by self-sufficiency and the spirit of comradeship, in which were kindled at every moment now the interest now the insolent indifference with which each of them sparkled according as her glance fell on one of her friends or on passing strangers, that consciousness, moreover, of knowing one another intimately enough always to go about together, by making them a ‚Äòband apart‚Äô established between their independent and separate bodies, as slowly they advanced, a bond invisible but harmonious, like a single warm shadow, a single atmosphere making of them a whole as homogeneous in its parts as it was different from the crowd through which their procession gradually wound
¬†¬†¬†For an instant, as I passed the dark one with the fat cheeks who was wheeling a bicycle, I caught her smiling, sidelong glance, aimed from the centre of that inhuman world which enclosed the life of this little tribe, an inaccessible, unknown world to which the idea of what I was could certainly never attain nor find a place in it. Wholly occupied with what her companions were saying, this young girl in her polo-cap, pulled down very low over her brow, had she seen me at the moment in which the dark ray emanating from her eyes had fallen on me? In the heart of what universe did she distinguish me? It would have been as hard for me to say as, when certain peculiarities are made visible, thanks to the telescope, in a neighbouring planet, it is difficult to arrive at the conclusion that human beings inhabit it, that they can see us, or to say what ideas the sight of us can have aroused in their minds
¬†¬†¬†If we thought that the eyes of a girl like that were merely two glittering sequins of mica, we should not be athirst to know her and to unite her life to ours. But we feel that what shines in those reflecting discs is not due solely to their material composition; that it is, unknown to us, the dark shadows of the ideas that the creature is conceiving, relative to the people and places that she knows ‚Äî the turf of racecourses, the sand of cycling tracks over which, pedalling on past fields and woods, she would have drawn me after her, that little peri, more seductive to me than she of the Persian paradise ‚Äî the shadows, too, of the home to which she will presently return, of the plans that she is forming or that others have formed for her; and above all that it is she, with her desires, her sympathies, her revulsions, her obscure and incessant will. I knew that I should never possess this young cyclist if I did not possess also what there was in her eyes. And it was consequently her whole life that filled me with desire; a sorrowful desire because I felt that it was not to be realised, but exhilarating, because what had hitherto been my life, having ceased of a sudden to be my whole life, being no more now than a little part of the space stretching out before me, which I was burning to cover and which was composed of the lives of these girls, offered me that prolongation, that possible multiplication of oneself which is happiness. And no doubt the fact that we had, these girls and I, not one habit ‚Äî as we had not one idea ‚Äî in common, was to make it more difficult for me to make friends with them and to please them. But perhaps, also, it was thanks to those differences, to my consciousness that there did not enter into the composition of the nature and actions of these girls a single element that I knew or possessed, that there came in place of my satiety a thirst ‚Äî like that with which a dry land burns ‚Äî for a life which my soul, because it had never until now received one drop of it, would absorb all the more greedily in long draughts, with a more perfect imbibition
¬†¬†¬†I had looked so closely at the dark cyclist with the bright eyes that she seemed to notice my attention, and said to the biggest of the girls something that I could not hear. To be honest, this dark one was not the one that pleased me most, simply because she was dark and because (since the day on which, from the little path by Tansonville, I had seen Gilberte) a girl with reddish hair and a golden skin had remained for me the inaccessible ideal. But Gilberte herself, had I not loved her principally because she had appeared to me haloed with that aureole of being the friend of Bergotte, of going with him to look at old cathedrals? And in the same way could I not rejoice at having seen this dark girl look at me (which made me hope that it would be easier for me to get to know her first), for she would introduce me to the others, to the pitiless one who had jumped over the old man‚Äôs head, to the cruel one who had said ‚ÄúHe makes me sick, poor old man!‚Äù‚Äî to all of them in turn, among whom, moreover, she had the distinction of being their inseparable companion? And yet the supposition that I might some day be the friend of one or other of these girls, that their eyes, whose incomprehensible gaze struck me now and again, playing upon me unawares, like the play of sunlight upon a wall, might ever, by a miraculous alchemy, allow to interpenetrate among their ineffable particles the idea of my existence, some affection for my person, that I myself might some day take my place among them in the evolution of their course by the sea‚Äôs edge ‚Äî that supposition appeared to me to contain within it a contradiction as insoluble as if, standing before some classical frieze or a fresco representing a procession, I had believed it possible for me, the spectator, to take my place, beloved of them, among the godlike hierophants
¬†¬†¬†The happiness of knowing these girls was, then, not to be realised. Certainly it would not have been the first of its kind that I had renounced. I had only to recall the numberless strangers whom, even at Balbec, the carriage bowling away from them at full speed had forced me for ever to abandon. And indeed the pleasure that was given me by the little band, as noble as if it had been composed of Hellenic virgins, came from some suggestion that there was in it of the flight of passing figures along a road. This fleetingness of persons who are not known to us, who force us to put out from the harbour of life, in which the women whose society we frequent have all, in course of time, laid bare their blemishes, urges us into that state of pursuit in which there is no longer anything to arrest the imagination. But to strip our pleasures of imagination is to reduce them to their own dimensions, that is to say to nothing. Offered me by one of those procuresses (whose good offices, all the same, the reader has seen that I by no means scorned), withdrawn from the element which gave them so many fine shades and such vagueness, these girls would have enchanted me less. We must have imagination, awakened by the uncertainty of being able to attain our object, to create a goal which hides our other goal from us, and by substituting for sensual pleasures the idea of penetrating into a life prevents us from recognising that pleasure, from tasting its true savour, from restricting it to its own range
¬†¬†¬†There must be, between us and the fish which, if we saw it for the first time cooked and served on a table, would not appear worth the endless trouble, craft and stratagem that are necessary if we are to catch it, interposed, during our afternoons with the rod, the ripple to whose surface come wavering, without our quite knowing what we intend to do with them, the burnished gleam of flesh, the indefiniteness of a form, in the fluidity of a transparent and flowing azure
¬†¬†¬†These girls benefited also by that alteration of social values characteristic of seaside life. All the advantages which, in our ordinary environment, extend and magnify our importance, we there find to have become invisible, in fact to be eliminated; while on the other hand the people whom we suppose, without reason, to enjoy similar advantages appear to us amplified to artificial dimensions. This made it easy for strange women generally, and to-day for these girls in particular, to acquire an enormous importance in my eyes, and impossible to make them aware of such importance as I might myself possess
¬†¬†¬†But if there was this to be said for the excursion of the little band, that it was but an excerpt from the innumerable flight of passing women, which had always disturbed me, their flight was here reduced to a movement so slow as to approach immobility. Now, precisely because, in a phase so far from rapid, faces no longer swept past me in a whirlwind, but calm and distinct still appeared beautiful, I was prevented from thinking as I had so often thought when Mme. de Villeparisis‚Äôs carriage bore me away that, at closer quarters, if I had stopped for a moment, certain details, a pitted skin, drooping nostrils, a silly gape, a grimace of a smile, an ugly figure might have been substituted, in the face and body of the woman, for those that I had doubtless imagined; for there had sufficed a pretty outline, a glimpse of a fresh complexion, for me to add, in entire good faith, a fascinating shoulder, a delicious glance of which I carried in my mind for ever a memory or a preconceived idea, these rapid decipherings of a person whom we see in motion exposing us thus to the same errors as those too rapid readings in which, on a single syllable and without waiting to identify the rest, we base instead of the word that is in the text a wholly different word with which our memory supplies us. It could not be so with me now. I had looked well at them all; each of them I had seen, not from every angle and rarely in full face, but all the same in two or three aspects different enough to enable me to make either the correction or the verification, to take a ‚Äòproof of the different possibilities of line and colour that are hazarded at first sight, and to see persist in them, through a series of expressions, something unalterably material. I could say to myself with conviction that neither in Paris nor at Balbec, in the most favourable hypotheses of what might have happened, even if I had been able to stop and talk to them, the passing women who had caught my eye, had there ever been one whose appearance, followed by her disappearance without my having managed to know her, had left me with more regret than would these, had given me the idea that her friendship might be a thing so intoxicating. Never, among actresses nor among peasants nor among girls from a convent school had I beheld anything so beautiful, impregnated with so much that was unknown, so inestimably precious, so apparently inaccessible. They were, of the unknown and potential happiness of life, an illustration so delicious and in so perfect a state that it was almost for intellectual reasons that I was desperate with the fear that I might not be able to make, in unique conditions which left no room for any possibility of error, proper trial of what is the most mysterious thing that is offered to us by the beauty which we desire and console ourselves for never possessing, by demanding pleasure ‚Äî as Swann had always refused to do before Odette‚Äôs day ‚Äî from women whom we have not desired, so that, indeed, we die without having ever known what that other pleasure was. No doubt it was possible that it was not in reality an unknown pleasure, that on a close inspection its mystery would dissipate and vanish, that it was no more than a projection, a mirage of desire. But in that case I could blame only the compulsion of a law of nature ‚Äî which if it applied to these girls would apply to all ‚Äî and not the imperfection of the object. For it was that which I should have chosen above all others, feeling quite certain, with a botanist‚Äôs satisfaction, that it was not possible to find collected anywhere rarer specimens than these young flowers who were interrupting at this moment before my eyes the line of the sea with their slender hedge, like a bower of Pennsylvania roses adorning a garden on the brink of a cliff, between which is contained the whole tract of ocean crossed by some steamer, so slow in gliding along the blue and horizontal line that stretches from one stem to the next that an idle butterfly, dawdling in the cup of a flower which the moving hull has long since passed, can, if it is to fly and be sure of arriving before the vessel, wait until nothing but the tiniest slice of blue still separates the questing prow from the first petal of the flower towards which it is steering
¬†¬†¬†I went indoors because I was to dine at Rivebelle with Robert, and my grandmother insisted that on those evenings, before going out, I must lie down for an hour on my bed, a rest which the Balbec doctor presently ordered me to extend to the other evenings also
¬†¬†¬†However, there was no need, when one went indoors, to leave the ‚Äòfront‚Äô and to enter the hotel by the hall, that is to say from behind. By virtue of an alteration of the clock which reminded me of those Saturdays when, at Combray, we used to have luncheon an hour earlier, now with summer at the full the days had become so long that the sun was still high in the heavens, as though it were only tea-time, when the tables were being laid for dinner in the Grand Hotel. And so the great sliding windows were kept open from the ground. I had but to step across a low wooden sill to find myself in the dining-room, through which I walked and straight across to the lift
¬†¬†¬†As I passed the office I addressed a smile to the manager, and with no shudder of disgust gathered one for myself from his face which, since I had been at Balbec, my comprehensive study of it was injecting and transforming, little by little, like a natural history preparation. His features had become familiar to me, charged with a meaning that was of no importance but still intelligible, like a script which one can read, and had ceased in any way to resemble these queer, intolerable characters which his face had presented to me on that first day, when I had seen before me a personage now forgotten, or, if I succeeded in recalling him, unrecognisable, difficult to identify with this insignificant and polite personality of which the other was but a caricature, a hideous and rapid sketch. Without either the shyness or the sadness of the evening of my arrival I rang for the attendant, who no longer stood in silence while I rose by his side in the lift as in a mobile thoracic cage propelled upwards along its ascending pillar, but repeated:
¬†¬†¬† ‚ÄúThere aren‚Äôt the people now there were a month back. They‚Äôre beginning to go now; the days are drawing in.‚Äù He said this not because there was any truth in it but because, having an engagement, presently, for a warmer part of the coast, he would have liked us all to leave, so that the hotel could be shut up and he have a few days to himself before ‚Äòrejoining‚Äô in his new place. ‚ÄòRejoin‚Äô and ‚Äònew‚Äô were not, by the way, incompatible terms, since, for the lift-boy,‚Äòrejoin‚Äô was the usual form of the verb ‚Äòto join.‚Äô The only thing that surprised me was that he condescended to say ‚Äòplace,‚Äô for he belonged to that modern proletariat which seeks to efface from our language every trace of the rule of domesticity. A moment later, however, he informed me that in the ‚Äòsituation‚Äô which he was about to ‚Äòrejoin,‚Äô he would have a smarter ‚Äòtunic‚Äô and a better ‚Äòsalary,‚Äô the words ‚Äòlivery‚Äô and ‚Äòwages‚Äô sounding to him obsolete and unseemly. And as, by an absurd contradiction, the vocabulary has, through thick and thin, among us ‚Äòmasters,‚Äô survived the conception of inequality, I was always failing to understand what the lift-boy said. For instance, the only thing that interested me was to know whether my grandmother was in the hotel. Now, forestalling my questions, the lift-boy would say to me: ‚ÄúThat lady has just gone out from your rooms.‚Äù I was invariably taken in; I supposed that he meant my grandmother. ‚ÄúNo, that lady; I think she‚Äôs an employee of yours.‚Äù As in the old speech of the middle classes, which ought really to be done away with, a cook is not called an employee, I thought for a moment: ‚ÄúBut he must be mistaken. We don‚Äôt own a factory; we haven‚Äôt any employees.‚Äù Suddenly I remembered that the title of ‚Äòemployee‚Äô is, like the wearing of a moustache among waiters, a sop to their self-esteem given to servants, and realised that this lady who had just gone out must be Fran√ßoise (probably on a visit to the coffee-maker, or to watch the Belgian lady‚Äôs little maid at her sewing), though even this sop did not satisfy the lift-boy, for he would say quite naturally, speaking pityingly of his own class, ‚Äòwith the working man‚Äô or ‚Äòthe small person,‚Äô using the same singular form as Racine when he speaks of ‚Äòthe poor.‚Äô But as a rule, for my zeal and timidity of the first evening were now things of the past, I no longer spoke to the lift-boy. It was he now who stood there and received no answer during the short journey on which he threaded his way through the hotel, hollowed out inside like a toy, which extended round about us, floor by floor, the ramifications of its corridors in the depths of which the light grew velvety, lost its tone, diminished the communicating doors, the steps of the service stairs which it transformed into that amber haze, unsubstantial and mysterious as a twilight, in which Rembrandt picks out here and there a window-sill or a well-head. And on each landing a golden light reflected from the carpet indicated the setting sun and the lavatory window
¬†¬†¬†I asked myself whether the girls I had just seen lived at Balbec, and who they could be. When our desire is thus concentrated upon a little tribe of humanity which it singles out from the rest, everything that can be associated with that tribe becomes a spring of emotion and then of reflexion. I had heard a lady say on the ‚Äòfront‚Äô: ‚ÄúShe is a friend of the little Simonet girl‚Äù with that self-important air of inside knowledge, as who should say: ‚ÄúHe is the inseparable companion of young La Rochefoucauld.‚Äù And immediately she had detected on the face of the person to whom she gave this information a curiosity to see more of the favoured person who was ‚Äòa friend of the little Simonet.‚Äô A privilege",en,LABEL_0,0.46377670764923096,LABEL_1,0.5362232327461243

I.
SPRING on the Polar Seas!‚Äînot violet-crowned
By dewy Hours, nor to c√¶rulean halls
Melodious hymned, yet Light itself around
Her stately path, sheds starry coronals.
Sublime she comes, as when, from Dis set free,
Came, through the flash of Jove, Persephon√®:
II.
She comes‚Äîthat grand Aurora of the North!
By steeds of fire her glorious chariot borne,
From Boreal courts the meteors flaming forth,
Ope heaven on heaven, before the mighty Morn,
And round the rebel giants of the Night
On earth‚Äôs last confines bursts the storm of light.
III.
Wonder and awe! lo, where against the sun
A second sun his lurid front uprears!
As if the first-born lost Hyperion,
Hurled down of old, from his Uranian spheres,
Rose from the hell-rocks on his writhings piled,
And glared defiance on his Titan child.
IV.
Now life, the polar life, returns once more,
The reindeer roots his mosses from the snows;
The whirring sea-gulls shriek along the shore;
Thro' oozing rills the cygnet gleaming goes;
And, where the ice some happier verdure frees,
Laugh into light frank-eyed anemon√®s.
V.
Out from the seas still solid, frowned a lone
Chaos of chasm and precipice and rock,
There, while the meteors on their revels shone,
Growling hoarse glee, in many a grisly flock,
With their huge young, the sea-bears sprawling played
Near the charred crater some mute Hecla made.
VI.
Sullen before that cavern‚Äôs vast repose,
Like the lorn wrecks of a despairing race
Chased to their last hold by triumphant foes,
Darkness and Horror stood.   But from the space
Within the cave, and o‚Äôer the ice-ground wan,
Quivers a Shadow vaguely mocking man.
VII.
Like man‚Äôs the Shadow falls, yet falling loses
The shape it took, each moment changefully;
As when the wind on Runic waves confuses
The weird boughs tossed from some prophetic tree;
Fantastic, goblin-like, and fitful thrown,
Comes the strange Shadow from the drear Unknown.
VIII.
It is not man‚Äôs‚Äîfor they, man‚Äôs savage foes,
Whose sense ne‚Äôer fails them when the scent is blood,
Sport in the shadow the Unseen One throws,
Nor hush their young to sniff the human food;
But, undisturbed as if their home was there,
Pass to and fro the light-defying lair.
IX.
So the bears gambolled, so the Shadow played,
When sudden halts the uncouth merriment.
Now man‚Äîin truth, draws near; man‚Äôs steps invade
The men-devourers!‚ÄîSnorting to the scent,
Lo, where they stretch dread necks of shaggy snow,
Grin with white fangs, and greed the blood to flow!
X.
Grotesquely undulating, moves the flock,
Low grumbling as the sluggish ranks divide;
Some heave their slow bulk peering up the rock,
Some stand erect, and shift from side to side
The keen quick ear, the red dilating eye,
And steam the hard air with a hungry sigh.
XI.
At length unquiet and amazed‚Äîas rings
On to their haunt direct, the dauntless stride,
With the sharp instinct of all savage things
That doubt a prey by which they are defied,
They send from each to each a troubled stare,
And huddle close, suspicious of the snare.
XII.
Then a huge leader, with concerted wile,
Creeps lumbering on, and, to his guidance slow
The shagg√´d armies move, in cautious file,
Till one by one, in ambush for the foe,
Drops into chasm and cleft,‚Äîand, vanishing,
With stealthy murther girds the coming King.
XIII.
He comes,‚Äîthe Conqueror in the Halls of Time,
Known by his herald in the starry Dove,
By his imperial tread, and front sublime
With power as tranquil as the lids of Jove,‚Äî
All shapes of death the realms around afford:‚Äî
From Fiends God guard him!‚Äîfrom all else his sword!
XIV.
For he, with spring the huts of ice had left
And the small People of the world of snows:
Their food the seal, their camp at night, the cleft,
His bold Norwegians follow where he goes;
Now in the rear afar, their chief they miss,
And grudge the danger which they deem a bliss.
XV.
Ere yet the meteors from the morning sky
Chased large Orion,‚Äîin the hour when sleep
Reflects its ghost-land stillest on the eye,
Had sto1'n the lonely King; and o'er the deep
Sought by the clue the dwarfmen-legends yield,
And the Dove's wing‚Äîthe demon-guarded Shield.
XVI.
The desert of the desolate is won.
Still lurks, unseen, the ambush horrible‚Äî
Nought stirs around beneath the twofold sun
Save that strange Shadow, where before it fell,
Still falling;‚Äîvarying, quivering to and fro,
From the black cavern on the glaring snow.
XVII.
Slow the devourers rise, and peer around:
Now crag and cliff move dire with savage life,
And rolling downward,‚Äîall the dismal ground
Shakes with the roar and bristles with the strife:
Not unprepared‚Äî(when ever are the brave?)
Stands the firm King, and bares the diamond glaive.
XVIII.
Streams, thro‚Äô the meteor fires, the fulgent brand,
Lightening along the air, the sea, the rock,
Bright as the arrow in that heavenly hand
Which slew the Python.   Blinded halt the flock,
And the great roar, but now so rough and high,
Sinks into terror wailing timidly.
XIX.
Yet the fierce instinct and the rabid sting
Of famine goad again the checkt array;
And close and closer in tumultuous ring,
Reels on the brute-mass crushing towards its prey.
A dull groan tells where first the falchion sweeps‚Äî
When into shape the cave-born Shadow leaps!
XX.
Out from the dark it leapt‚Äîthe awful form!
Manlike, but, sure, not human; on its hair
The ice-barbs bristled: like a coming storm
Its breath smote lifeless every wind in air;
Dread form deformed, as, ere the birth of Light,
Some son of Chaos and the Antique Night!
XXI.
At once a dwarf and giant‚Äîtrunk and limb
Knit in gnarled strength as by a monstrous chance,
Never Chim√¶ra more grotesque and grim,
Paled √Ügypt‚Äôs priesthood with its own romance,
When, from each dire delirium Fancy knows,
Some Typhon-type of Powers destroying rose.
XXII.
At the dread presence, ice a double cold
Conceived; the meteors from their dazzling play
Paused; and appalled into their azure hold
Shrunk back with all their banners; not a ray
Broke o‚Äôer the dead sea and the doleful shore,
Winter‚Äôs steel grasp lockt the dumb world once more.
XXIII.
Halted the war‚Äîas the wild multitude
Left the King scatheless, and their leaders slain;
And round the giant dwarf the baleful brood
Came with low growls of terror, wrath, and pain,
As children round their father.   With a start
Arthur recoiled‚Äîfear fell upon his heart,
XXIV.
And as he gazed, he paled. Then spoke aloud
The horrent Image.   ‚ÄúChild of hateful Day,
What madness snares thee to the glooms that shroud
The realms abandoned to my secret sway?
Why on mine air first breathes the human breath?
Hath thy far world no fairer path to Death?‚Äù
XXV.
‚ÄúAll ways to Death, but one to Glory leads,
That which alike thro‚Äô earth, or air, or wave,
Bears a bold thought to goals in noble deeds,‚Äù
Said the pale King.   ‚ÄúAnd this, methinks, the cave
Which hides the Shield that rocked the sleep of one
By whom ev‚Äôn Fable shows what deeds were done.
XXVI.
‚ÄúI seek the talisman which guards the free,
And tread where erst the Sire of freemen trod.‚Äù
‚ÄúHo!‚Äù laugh'd the dwarf, ‚ÄúWalhalla‚Äôs child was He!
Man gluts the fiend when he assumes the god.‚Äù‚Äî
‚ÄúNo god, Deceiver, tho‚Äô man‚Äôs erring creeds
Make gods of men when godlike are their deeds;
XXVII.
‚ÄúAnd if the Only and Eternal One
Hath, ere his last and luminous Word Revealed,
Left some grand Memory on its airy throne,
Nor smit the nations when to names they kneeled‚Äî
In each false god was typed, since Time began,
Some truth in Nature or some worth in Man.‚Äù
XXVIII.
The Demon heard; and, as a moon that shines,
Rising behind Arcturus, wan and chill
O'er Baltic headlands black with rigid pines,
Makes ghostly night thus lit, more ghostly still‚Äî
So the fiend‚Äôs mocking smile but deepened more
The menacing gloom which the dire aspect wore.
XXIX.
‚ÄúHo!‚Äù said the Dwarf, ‚ÄúThou would'st survive to tell
Of trophies wrested from the halls of Lok,
Yet wherefore singly face the hosts of Hell?
Return, and lead thy comrades to the rock;
Ne‚Äôer to one man in any mortal field,
Did the fierce Valkyrs who lead armies yield.‚Äù
XXX.
‚ÄúWar,‚Äù said the King, ‚Äúwhen waged on mortal life
By mortal men;‚Äîthat dare I with the rest:
In conflicts awful with no human strife,
Mightiest methinks, that soul the loneliest.
When starry charms from Afrite caves were won,
No Judah marched with dauntless Solomon!""
XXXI.
Fell fangs the demon gnasht, and o‚Äôer the crowd
Wild cumbering round his feet, with hungry stare
Greeding the man, his drooping visage bowed;
‚ÄúGo elsewhere, sons‚Äîyour prey escapes the snare:
Yours but the food which flesh to flesh supplies;
Here not the mortal but the soul defies.‚Äù
XXXII.
Then striding to the cave, he plunged within;
‚ÄúFollow,‚Äù he cried: like an imprisoned blast
In midnight rock-vaults, the reverberate din
Rolled from the rough sides of the rayless Vast;
As goblin echoes, thro‚Äô the haunted hollow,
‚ÄòTwixt groan and laughter, chimed hoarse-gibbering ‚ÄúFollow!‚Äù
XXXIII.
The King recoiling paused irresolute,
Till thro‚Äô the cave the white wing went its way;
Then on his breast he signed the cross, and, mute
With solemn prayer, he left the world of day.
Thick stood the night, save where the falchion gave
Its clear sharp glimmer lengthening down the cave.
XXXIV.
Advancing, flashes rushed irregular
Like subterranean lightning, forked and red:
From warring matter, wandering shot the star
Of poisonous gases; and the tortured bed
Of the old Volcano showed, in trailing fires,
Where the numbed serpent dragged its mangled spires.
XXXV.
Broader and ruddier on the Dove‚Äôs pale wings
Now glowed the lava of the widening spaces;
Grinned, from the rock, the jaws of giant things,
The lurid skeletons of vanished races,
They who, perchance ere man himself had birth,
Ruled the moist slime of uncompleted earth.
XXXVI.
Enormous coucht fanged Iguanodon,
To which the monster-lizard of the Nile
Were prey too small,‚Äîwhose dismal haunts were on
The swamps where now such golden harvests smile
As had sufficed those myriad hosts to feed
When all the Orient marched behind the Mede.
XXXVII.
There the foul, earliest reptile spectra lay,
Distinct as when the chaos was their home;
Half plant, half serpent, some subside away
Into gnarled roots (now stone)‚Äîmore hideous some,
Half bird‚Äîhalf fish‚Äîseem struggling yet to spring,
Shark-like the maw, and dragon-like the wing.
XXXVIII.
But, life-like more, from later layers emerge
With their fell tusks deep-stricken in the stone,
Herds,¬∑that thro‚Äô all the thunders of the surge,
Had to the Ark which swept relentless on
(Denied to them)‚Äîknelled the despairing roar
Of sentenced races time shall know no more.
XXXIX.
Under the limbs of mammoths went the path,
Or thro‚Äô the arch immense of Dragon jaws,
And ever on the King‚Äîin watchful wrath
Gazed the attendant Fiend, with artful pause
Where dread was dreadliest; had the mortal one
Faltered or quailed, the Fiend his prey had won,
XL.
And rent it limb by limb; but on the Dove
Arthur looked steadfast, and the Fiend was foiled.
Now, as along the skeleton world they move,
Strange noises jar, and flit strange shadows. Toiled
The Troll‚Äôs swart people, in their inmost home
At work on ruin for the days to come.
XLI.
A baleful race, whose anvils forge the flash
Of iron murder for the limbs of war;
Who ripen hostile embryos, for the crash
Of earthquakes rolling slow to towers afar;
Or train from Hecla‚Äôs fount the lurid rills,
To cities sleeping under shepherd hills;
XLII.
Or nurse the seeds, thro‚Äô patient ages rife
With the full harvest of that crowning fire,
When for the sentenced Three,‚ÄîTime, Death, and Life,
Our globe itself shall be the funeral pyre;
And, awed, in orbs remote, some race unknown
Shall miss one star, whose smile had lit their own.
XLIII.
Thro‚Äô the Phlegr√¶an glare, innumerous eyes,
Fierce with the murther-lust, scowl ravening,
And forms, on which had never looked the skies
Stalk near and nearer, swooping round the King,
Till from the blazing sword the foul array
Shrink back, and wolf-like follow on the way.
XLIV.
Now thro‚Äô waste mines of iron, whose black peaks
Frown o‚Äôer dull Phlegethons of fire below,
While, vague as worlds unformed, sulphureous reeks
Roll on before them huge and dun,‚Äîthey go.
Vanish abrupt the vapours: from the night
Springs, and spreads rushing, like a flood, the light.
XLV.
A mighty cirque with lustre belts the mine;
Its walls of iron glittering into steel;
Wall, upon wall reflected, flings the shine
Of armour: vizorless the Corpses kneel,
Their glazed eyes fixed upon a couch¬∑where, screened
With whispering curtains, sleeps the Kingly Fiend:
XLVI.
Corpses of giants, who perchance had heard
The tromps of Tubal, and had leapt to strife,
Whose guilt provoked the Deluge: sepulchr√´d
In their world‚Äôs ruins, still a frown like life
Hung o‚Äôer vast brows,‚Äîand spears, like turrets, shone
In hands whose grasp had crushed the Mastodon.
XLVII.
Around the couch, a silent solemn ring,
They whom the Teuton call the Valkyrs, sate.
Shot thro‚Äô pale webs their spindles glistening;
Dread tissues woven out of human hate
For heavenly ends!‚Äîfor, there, is spun the woe
Of every war that ever earth shall know.
XLVIII.
Below their feet a bottomless pit of gore
Yawned, where each web, when once the woof was done,
Was scornful cast.   Yet rising evermore
Out of the surface, wandered airy on
Till lost in upper space, pale wing√´d seeds
The future heaven-fruit of the hell-born deeds;
XLIX.
For out of every evil born of time,
God shapes a good for his eternity.
Lo where the spindles, weaving crime on crime,
Form the world-work of Charlemains to be;‚Äî
How in that hall of iron lengthen forth
The fates that ruin, to rebuild, the North!
L.
Here, one stern Sister, smiling on the King,
Hurries the thread that twines his Nation‚Äôs doom,
And, farther down, the whirring spindles sing
Around the woof which from his Baltic home
Shall charm the avenging Norman, to control
The shattered races into one calm whole.
LI.
Already here, the hueless lines along,
Grows the red creed of the Arabian horde;
Already here, the armed Chivalric Wrong
Which made the cross the symbol of the sword,
Which thy worst idol, Rome, to Judah gave,
And worshipped Mars upon the Saviour‚Äôs grave.
LII.
Already the wild Tartar in his tents,
Dreamless of thrones;‚Äîand the fierce Visigoth
Who on Colombia‚Äôs golden armaments
Shall loose the hell-hounds,‚Äînurse the age-long growth
Of Desolation‚Äîas the noiseless skein
Clasps in its web, thy far descendants, Cain!
LIII.
Already, in the hearts of sires remote
In their rude Isle, the spell ordains the germ
Of what shall be a Name of wonder, wrought
From that fell feast which Glory gives the worm,
When Rome's dark bird shall shade, with thunder-wings,
Calm brows that brood the doom of breathless kings.
LIV.
Already, tho‚Äô the sad unheeded eyes
Of Bards alone foresee, and none believe,
The lightning, hoarded from the farthest skies,
Into the mesh the race-destroyers weave,
When o‚Äôer our marts shall graze a stranger‚Äôs fold,
And the new Tarshish rot, as rots the old.
LV.
Yea, ever there, each spectral hand the birth
Weaves of a war‚Äîuntil the angel-blast,
Pealed from the tromp that knells the doom of earth,‚Äî
Shall start the livid legions from their last;
And man, with arm uplifted still to slay,
Reel on some Alp that rolls in smoke away!
LVI.
Fierce glared the dwarf upon the silent King,
‚ÄúThere, is the prize thy visions would achieve!
There, where the hushed inexorable ring
Murder the myriads in the webs they weave,
Behind the curtains of Incarnate War,
Whose lightest tremour topples thrones afar,‚Äî
LVII.
‚ÄúWhich ev‚Äôn the Valkyrs, with their bloodless hands,
Dare not to draw aside,‚Äîgo, seek the Shield!
Yet be what follows known!‚Äîyon kneeling bands
Whose camps were Andes, and whose battle-field
Left plains, now empires, rolling seas of gore,
Shall hear the clang and leap to life once more.
LVIII.
‚ÄúRoused from their task, revengeful shall arise
The never baffled ‚ÄòChoosers of the Slain,‚Äô
The Fiend thy hand shall wake, unclose the eyes
That flashed on heavenly hosts their storms again,
And thy soul wither in the mighty frown
Before whose night, an earlier sun sunk down:
LIX.
‚ÄúThe rocks shall close all path for flight save one,
Where now the Troll-fiends wait to rend their prey,
And each malign and monster skeleton,
Re-clothed with life as in the giant day
When yonder seas were valleys‚Äîscent thy gore
And grin with fangs that gnash for food once more.
LX.
‚ÄúHo, dost thou shudder, pale one? Back and live.‚Äù
Thrice strove the King for speech, and thrice in vain,
For he was man, and, till our souls survive
The instincts born of flesh, shall Horror reign
In that Unknown beyond the realms of Sense,
Where the soul‚Äôs darkness seems the man‚Äôs defence.
LXI.
Yet as when thro‚Äô uncertain troublous cloud
Breaks the sweet morning star, and from its home
Smiles lofty peace, so thro‚Äô the phantom crowd
Of fears‚Äîthe Eos of the world to come,
FAITH, looked‚Äîrevealing how earth-nourished are
The clouds; and how beyond their reach the star.
LXII.
Mute on his knee, amidst the kneeling dead
He sank;‚Äîthe dead the dreaming fiend revered,
And he, the living, God! Then terror fled,
And all the king illumed the front he reared.
Firm to the couch on which the fiend reposed
He strode;‚Äîthe curtains, murmuring, round him closed.
LXIII.
Now while this chanced, without the tortured rock
Raged fierce the war between the rival might
Of beast and man; the dwarf king‚Äôs ravenous flock
And Norway‚Äôs warriors led by Cymri‚Äôs knight;
For by the foot-prints thro‚Äô the snows explored,
On to the rock the bands had tracked their lord.
LXIV.
Repelled, not conquered, back to crag and cave,
Sullen and watchful still, the monsters go;
And solitude resettles on the wave,
But silence not; around, aloft, alow
Roar the couched beasts, and, answering from the main,
Shrieks the shrill gull and booms the dismal crane.
LXV.
And now the rock itself, from every tomb
Of its dead world within, sends voices forth,
Sounds direr far, than in its rayless gloom
Crash on the midnight of the farthest North;
From beasts our world hath lost, the strident yell,
The shout of giants and the laugh of hell.
LXVI.
Reels all the isle; and every rugged steep
Hurls down an avalanche;‚Äîall the crater cave
Glows into swarthy red, and fire-showers leap
From rended summits, hissing to the wave
Thro‚Äô its hard ice; or in huge crags, wide-sounding
Spring where they crash‚Äîon rushing and rebounding.
LXVII.
Dizzy and blind, the staggering Northmen fall
On earth that rocks beneath them like a bark;
Loud and more loud the tumult swells with all
The Acheron of the discord. Swift and dark,
From every cleft, the smoke-clouds burst their way,
Rush thro‚Äô the void, and sweep from heaven the day.
LXVIII.
Smitten beneath the pestilential blast
And the great terror, senseless lay the band,
Till the arrested life, with throes at last,
Gasped back: and holy over sea and land
Silence and light reposed. They looked above
And calm, in calm√´d air, beheld the Dove!
LXIX.
And o‚Äôer their prostrate lord was poised the wing;
And when they rushed and reached him, shouting joy,
There came no answer from the corpselike king;
And when his true knight raised him, heavily
Drooped his pale front on Gawaine‚Äôs faithful breast.
And the closed lids seemed leaden in their rest.
LXX.
And all his mail was dinted, hewn, and crushed,
And the bright falchion dim with foul dark gore;
And the strong pulse of the strong hand was hushed;
Like an exhausted storm which whilome bore
The bolts of Jove, when under lull√´d skies
The aspen stirs not to its lingering sighs.
LXXI.
And there was solemn change on that fair face,
Nor, whatsoe‚Äôer the fear or scorn had been,
Did the past passion leave its haggard trace;
But on the rigid beauty awe was seen,
As one who on the Gorgon‚Äôs aspect fell
Had gazed; and, freezing, yet survived the spell.
LXXII.
Not by the chasm in which he left the day,
But through a new-made gorge the fires had cleft,
As if with fires themselves were forced the way,
Had rushed the King;‚Äîand sense and sinew left
The form that struggled till the strife was o‚Äôer;
So faints the swimmer when he gains the shore.
LXXIII.
But on his arm was clasped the wondrous prize,
Dimmed, tarnished, grimed, and black with gore and smoke,
Still the pure metal, thro‚Äô each foul disguise,
Like starlight scattered on dark waters, broke;
Thro‚Äô gore, thro‚Äô smoke it shone‚Äîthe silver shield,
Clear as dawns Freedom from her battle-field.
LXXIV.
Days followed days, ere from that speechless trance
(Borne to green inlets, isled amid the snows,
Where led the Dove), the king‚Äôs reviving glance
Looked languid round on watchful, joyful brows;
Ev‚Äôn while he slept, new flowers the earth had given,
And on his heart brooded the bird of heaven.
LXXV.
But ne‚Äôer, as voice and strength and sense returned,
To his good knight the strife that won the Shield
Did Arthur tell; deep in his soul inurned,‚Äî
As in the grave its secret,‚Äînor revealed
To mortal ear‚Äîthat mystery which for ever
Flowed thro‚Äô his thought, as thro‚Äô the cave a river;
LXXVI.
Whether to Love, how true soe‚Äôer its faith,
Whether to Wisdom, whatsoe‚Äôer its skill,
Till his last hour, the struggle and the scathe
Remained unuttered and unutterable;
But aye, in solitude, in crowds, in strife,
In joy, that memory lived within his life:
LXXVII.
It made not sadness, tho‚Äô the calm grave smile
Never regained the lustre youth had given,‚Äî
But as some shadow of some holy pile
Consecrates ground on which it falls, to heaven,
That gloom the grandeur of religion wore,
And seemed to hallow all it rested o‚Äôer.
LXXVIII.
Such Freedom is, O Slave that would be free!
Never her real struggles into life
Hath History told. As it hath been shall be
The Apocalypse of Nations; nursed in strife
Not with the present, nor with living foes,
But where the centuries shroud their long repose.
LXXIX.
Out from the graves of earth‚Äôs prim√¶val bones,
The shield of empire, patient Force must win:
What made the Briton free? not crashing thrones
Nor parchment laws; the charter must begin
In Scythian tents, the steel of Nomad spears;
To date the freedom, count three thousand years!
LXXX.
Neither is Freedom, mirth.   Be free, O slave,
And, dance no more beneath the lazy palm.
Freedom‚Äôs mild brow with noble care is grave,
Her bliss is solemn as her strength is calm;
And. earnest thought from childlike sport debars
Men who have learned to look upon the stars.
LXXXI.
Now as the King revived, along the seas
Flowed back, enlarged to life, the lapsing waters,
Kissed from their slumber, by the loving breeze,
Glide, in light dance, the Ocean‚Äôs silver daughters‚Äî
And blithe and hopeful, o‚Äôer the sunny strands,
Listing the long-lost billow, rove the bands.
LXXXII.
At length, O sight of joy!‚Äîthe gleam of sails
Bursts on the solitude! more near and near
Come the white playmates of the buxom gales.‚Äî
The whistling cords, the sounds of man, they hear.
Shout answers shout;‚Äîlight sparkles round the oar‚Äî
And from the barks the boat skims on to shore.
LXXXIII.
It was a race from Rugen‚Äôs friendly soil,
Leagued by old ties with Cymri‚Äôs land and king,
Who, with the spring time, to their wonted spoil
Of seals and furs had spread the canvas wing
To bournes their fathers never yet had known;‚Äî
And found amazed, hearts bolder than their own.
LXXXIV.
Soon to the barks the Cymrians and their bands
Are borne: Bright-haired, above the gazing crews,
Lone on the loftiest deck, the leader stands,
To whom the King, his rank made known, renews
All that his tale of mortal hope and fear
Vouchsafes from truth to thrill a mortal‚Äôs ear;
LXXXV.
And from the barks whose sails the chief obey,
Craves one to waft where yet the fates may guide.‚Äî
With rugged wonder in his large survey,
The son of √Ügir that calm aspect eyed,
And seemed in awe, as of a god, to scan
Him who so moved his homage, yet was man.
LXXXVI.
Smoothing his voice, rough with accustomed swell
Above the storms, and the wild roar of war,
The Northman answered, ‚ÄúSkalds in winter tell
Of the dire dwarf who guards the Shield of Thor,
For one whose race, with Odin‚Äôs blent, shall be,
Lords of the only realm which suits the Free,
LXXXVII.
‚ÄúOcean!‚ÄîI greet thee, and this strong right hand
Place in thine own to pledge myself thy man.
Choose as thou wilt for thee and for thy band,
Amongst the sea-steeds in the stalls of Ran.
Need‚Äôst thou our arms against the Saxon foe?
Our flag shall fly where‚Äôer thy trumpets blow!‚Äù
LXXXVIII.
‚ÄúMen to be free must free themselves,‚Äù the King
Replied, proud-smiling. ‚ÄúEvery father-land
Spurns from its breast the recreant sons that cling
For hope, to standards winds not theirs have fanned.
Thankful thro‚Äô thee our foe we reach;‚Äîand then
Cymri hath steel eno‚Äô for Cymrian men!‚Äù
LXXXIX.
While these converse, Sir Gawaine, with his hound
Lured by a fragrant and delightsome smell
From roasts‚Äînot meant for Freya,‚Äîmakes his round,
Shakes hands with all, and hopes their wives are well.
From spit to spit with easy grace he walks,
And chines astounded vanish while he talks.
XC.
At earliest morn the bark to bear the King,
His sage discernment delicately stores,
Rejects the blubber and disdains the ling
For hams of rein-deers and for heads of boars,
Connives at seal, to satisfy his men,
But childless leaves each loud-lamenting hen.
XCI.
And now the bark the Cymrian prince ascends,
The large oars chiming to the chaunting crew,
(His leal Norwegian band) the new-found friends
From brazen trumpets blare their loud adieu.
Forth bounds the ship, and Gawaine, while it quickens,
The wind propitiates with three virgin chickens.
XCII.
Led by the Dove, more brightly day by day,
The vernal azure deepens in the sky;
Far from the Polar threshold smiles the way‚Äî
And lo, white Albion shimmers on the eye,
Nurse of all nations, who to breasts severe
Takes the rude children, the calm men to rear.
XCIII.
Doubt and amaze with joy perplex the King,
Not yet the task achieved, the mission done,
Why homeward steers the angel pilot‚Äôs wing?
Of the three labours rests the crowning one
Unreached the Gates at which he shall behold
And win‚Äîthe Child-guide with the locks of gold.
XCIV.
Yet still the Dove cleaves homeward thro‚Äô the air;
Glides o‚Äôer the entrance of an inland stream;
And rests at last on bowers of foliage; where
Thick forests close their ramparts on the beam,
And clasp with dipping boughs a grassy creek,
Whose marge slopes level with the brazen beak.
XCV.
Around his neck the shield the Adventurer slung,
And girt the enchanted sword. Then, kneeling, said
The young Ulysses of the golden tongue,
‚ÄúNot now to phantom foes the dove hath led;
For, if I err not, this a Mercian haven,
And from the dove peeps forth at last the raven!
XCVI.
‚ÄúNot lone, nor reckless, in these glooms profound,
Tempt the sure ambush of some Saxon host;
If out of sight, at least in reach of sound,
Let our stout Northmen follow up the coast;
Then if thou wilt, from each suspicious tree
Shake laurels down, but share them, Sire, with me?‚Äù
XCVII.
‚ÄúNay,‚Äù answered Arthur, ‚Äúever, as before,
Alone the Pilgrim to his bourne must go;
But range the men concealed along the shore;
Set watch, from these green turrets, for the foe;
Moored to the marge where broadest hangs the bough,
Hide from the sun the glitter of the prow;‚Äî
XCVIII.
‚ÄúAnd so farewell!‚Äù He said; to land he leapt;
And with dull murmur from its verdant waves,
O‚Äôer his high crest the billowy forest swept.
As tow‚Äôrds some fitful light the swimmer cleaves
His stalwart way,‚Äîso thro‚Äô the woven shades
Where the pale wing now glimmers and now fades,
XCIX.
With strong hand parting the tough branches, goes
Hour after hour the King; till light at last
From skies long hid, wide-silvering, interflows
Thro‚Äô opening glades;‚Äîthe length of gloom is past,
And the dark pines receding, stand around
A silent hill with antique ruins crowned.
C.
Day had long closed; and from the mournful deeps
Of old volcanoes spent, the livid moon
Which thro‚Äô the life of planets lifeless creeps
Her ghostly way, deaf to the choral tune
Of spheres rejoicing, on those ruins old
Looked down, herself a ruin,‚Äîhushed and cold.
CI.
Mutely the granite wrecks the King surveyed,
And knew the work of hands Cimmerian,
What time in starry robes, and awe, arrayed,
Grey Druids spoke the oracles of man‚Äî
Solving high riddles to Chald√¶an Mage,
Or the young wonder of the Samian Sage.
CII.
A date remounting far beyond the day
When Roman legions met the scyth√´d cars,
When purer founts sublime had lapsed away
Thro‚Äô the deep rents of unrecorded wars,
And bloodstained altars cursed the mountain sod,
Where the first faith had hail‚Äôd the only God:
CIII.
For all now left us of the parent Celt,
Is of that later and corrupter time:‚Äî
Not in rude domeless fanes those Fathers knelt,
Who lured the Brahman from his burning clime,
Who charmed lost science from each lone abyss,
And winged the shaft of Scythian Abaris.
CIV.
Yea, the grand sires of our prim√¶val race
Saw angel-tracks the earlier earth upon,
And as a rising sun, the morning face
Of Truth more near the flushed horizon shone;
Filling ev‚Äôn clouds with many a golden light,
Lost when the orb is at the noonday height.
CV.
Thro‚Äô the large ruins, now no more, the last
Perchance on earth of those diviner sires,
With noiseless step the lone descendant past;
Not there were seen B√ÇL-HUAN‚ÄôS amber pyres;
No circling shafts with barbarous fragments strewn,
Spoke creeds of carnage to the spectral moon.
CVI.
But art, vast, simple, and sublime, was there
Ev‚Äôn in its mournful wrecks,‚Äîsuch art foregone
As the first Builders, when their grand despair
Left Shinar‚Äôs tower and city half undone,
Taught where they wandered o‚Äôer the newborn world.‚Äî
Column, and vault, and roof, in ruin hurled,
CVII.
Still spoke of hands that founded Babylon.
So in the wrecks, the Lord of young Romance
By fallen pillars laid him musing down.
More large and large the moving shades advance,
Blending in one dim silence, sad and wan,
The past, the present, ruin and the man.
CVIII.
Now, o‚Äôer his lids life‚Äôs gentlest influence stole,
Life‚Äôs gentlest influence yet the likest death!
Prove not our dreams how little needs the soul
Light from the sense, or being from the breath?
Let but the world an instant fade from view,
And of itself the soul creates a new.
CIX.
Still thro‚Äô the hazy mists of stealing sleep,
The adventurer‚Äôs eyes explore the guardian wing,
There, where it broods upon the moss-grown heap,
With plumes that all the stars are silvering.
Slow close the lids‚Äîreopening with a start
As shoots a nameless terror thro‚Äô his heart:
CX.
That strange wild awe which haunted Childhood thrills,
When waking at the dead of Dark, alone;
A sense of sudden solitude which chills
The blood;‚Äîa shrinking as from shapes unknown;
An instinct both of some protection fled,
And of the coming of some ghastly dread.
CXI.
He looked, and lo, the dove was seen no more,
Lone lay the lifeless wrecks beneath the moon,
And the one loss gave all that seemed before
Desolate,‚Äîtwofold desolation!
How slight a thing, whose love our trust hast been,
Alters the world, when it no more is seen!
CXII.
He strove to speak, but voice was gone from him.
As in that loss, new might the terror took,
His veins congealed; and, interfused and dim,
Shadow and moonlight swam before his look;
Bristled his hair; and all the strong dismay

Oh, with you, with you

And I don't even know when I'll see you again
I'll just keep living this dream 'till the end
Oh, with you, with you

""I don't love you anymore""
A pretty line that I adore
Five words that I've heard before
'Cause‚ÄÖyou‚ÄÖkeep me on‚ÄÖa rope
And tied a noose around‚ÄÖmy throat
You're gone then back at my door

'Cause if you're gonna leave, better leave, better do it fast
Can't live a little longer sitting on your lap
'Cause you know what you're doin' when you're comin' back
And I don't wanna have another heart attack

Oh, I can't be your lover on a leash
Every other week, when you please
Oh, I can't be the kiss that you don't need
The lie between your teeth

The cut that always bleeds

'Cause if you're gonna leave, better leave, better do it fast
Can't live another minute bleedin' from my back

Rows of flimsy houses with gaping doors. Rare lamps with faint rainbow fans. Round Rabaiotti's halted ice gondola stunted men and women squabble. They grab wafers between which are wedged lumps of coal and copper snow. Sucking, they scatter slowly. Children. The swancomb of the gondola, highreared, forges on through the murk, white and blue under a lighthouse. Whistles call and answer.
THE CALLS Wait, my love, and I'll be with you.

THE ANSWERS Round behind the stable.
(A deaf mute idiot with goggle eyes, his shapeless mouth dribbling, jerks past, shaken in Saint Vitus' dance. A chain of children's hands imprisons him.)
THE CHILDREN Kithoguel Salute.
THE IDIOT (Lifts a palsied left arm and gurgles.) Grhahute!
THE CHILDREN Where's the great light?
THE IDIOT (Gobbing.) Ghaghahest.
(They release him. He jerks on. A pygmy woman swings on a rope slung between the railings, counting. A form sprawled against a dustbin and muffled by its arm and hat moves, groans, grinding growling teeth, and snores again. On a step a gnome totting among a rubbish tip crouches to shoulder a sack of rags and bones. A crone standing by with a smoky oil lamp rams the last bottle in the maw of his sack. He heaves his booty, tugs askew his peaked cap and hobbles off mutely. The crone makes back for her lair swaying her lamp. A bandy child, asquat on the doorstep with a papershuttlecock, crawls sidling after her in spurts, clutches her skirt, scrambles up. A drunken navvy ups with both hands the railings of an area, lurching heavily. At a corner two night watch in shoulder capes, their hands upon their staffholsters, loom tall. A plate crashes; a woman screams; a child wails. Oaths of a man roar, mutter, cease. Figures wander, lurk, peer from warrens. In a room lit by a candle stuck in a bottleneck a slut combs out the tatts from the hair of a scrofulous child. Cissy Caffrey's voice, still young, sings shrill from a lane.)
CISSY CAFFREY

I gave it to Molly
Because she was jolly,
The leg of the duck
The leg of the duck.
(Private Cart and Private Compton, swaggersticks tight in their oxters, as they march unsteadily rightaboutface and burst together from their mouths a volleyed fart. Laughter of men from the lane. A hoarse virago retorts.)
THE VIRAGO Signs on you, hairy arse. More power the Cavan girl.
CISSY CAFFREY More luck to me. Cavan, Cootehill and Belturbet.
(She sings.)
I gave it to Nelly
To stick in her belly
The leg of the duck
The leg of the duck.

(Private Cart and Private Compton turn and counterretort, their tunics bloodbright in a lampglow, black sockets of caps on their blond copper polls. Stephen Dedalus and Lynch pass through the crowd close to the redcoats.)
PRIVATE COMPTON (Jerks his finger.) Way for the parson.
PRIVATE CARR (Turns and calls.) What ho, parson!
CISSY CAFFREY (Her voice soaring higher.)
She has it, she got it,
Wherever she put it
The leg of the duck.
(Stephen, flourishing the ashplant in his left hand, chants with joy the introit for paschal time. Lynch, his jockey cap low on his brow, attends him, a sneer of discontent wrinkling his face.)
STEPHEN Vidi aquam egredientem de templo a latere dextro. Alleluia.
(The famished snaggletusks of an elderly bawd protrude from a doorway.)
THE BAWD (Her voice whispering huskily.) Sst! Come here till I tell you. Maidenhead inside. Sst.
STEPHEN (Altius aliqantulum) Et omnes ad quos pervenit acqua ista.
THE BAWD (Spits in their trail her jet of venom.) Trinity medicals. Fallopian tube. All prick and no pence.
(Edy Boardman, sniffling, crouched with Bertha Supple, draws her shawl across her nostrils.)
EDY BOARDMAN (Bickering.) And say the one: I seen you up Faithful place with your squarepusher, the greaser off the railway, in his cometobed hat. Did you, says I. That's not for you to say, says I. You never seen me in the mantrap with a married highlander, says I. The likes of her! Stag that one is. Stubborn as a mule! And her walking with two fellows the one time, Kildbride the enginedriver and lancecorporal Oliphant.
STEPHEN (Triumphaliter.) Salvi facti i sunt.
(He flourishes his ashplant shivering the lamp image, shattering light over the world. A liver and white spaniel on the prowl slinks after him, growling. Lynch scar's it with a kick.)
LYNCH So that?
STEPHEN (Looks behind.) So that gesture, not music, not odours, would be a universal language, the gift of tongues rendering visible not the lay sense but the first entelechy, the structural rhythm.
LYNCH Pornosophical philotheology. Metaphysics in Mecklenburg street!
STEPHEN We have shrewridden Shakespeare and henpecked Socrates. Even the allwisest stagyrite was bitted, bridled and mounted by a light of love.
LYNCH Ba!
STEPHEN Anyway, who wants two gestures to illustrate a loaf and a jug? This movement illustrates the loaf and jug of bread and wine in Omar. Hold my stick.
LYNCH Damn your yellow stick. Where are we going?
STEPHEN Lecherous lynx, to la belle dame sans merci, Georgina Johnson, ad deam qui laetificat juventutem meam.
(Stephen thrusts the ashplant on him and slowly holds out his hands, his head going back till both hands are a span from his breast, down turned in planes intersecting, the fingers about to part, the left being higher.)
LYNCH Which is the jug of bread? It skills not. That or the customhouse. Illustrate thou. Here take your crutch and walk.
(They pass. Tommy Caffrey scrambles to a gaslamp and, clasping, climbs in spasms. From the top spur he slides down. Jacky Caffrey clasps to climb. The navvy lurches against the lamp. The twins scuttle off in the dark. The navvy, swaying, presses a forefinger against a wing of his nose and ejects from the farther nostril a long liquid jet of snot. Shouldering the lamp he staggers away through the crowd with his flaring cresset.
Snakes of river fog creep slowly. From drains, clefts, cesspools, middens arise on all sides stagnant fumes. A glow leaps in the south beyond the seaward reaches of the river. The navvy staggering forward cleaves the crowd and lurches towards the tramsiding. On the farther side under the railway bridge Bloom appears flushed, panting, cramming bread and chocolate into a side pocket. From Gillens hairdressers window a composite portrait shows him gallant Nelson's image. A concave mirror at the side presents to him lovelorn longlost lugubru Booloohoom. Grave Gladstone sees him level Bloom for Bloom. He passes, struck by the stare of truculent Wellington but in the con vex mirror grin unstruck the bonham eyes and fatchuck cheekchops of Jollypoldy the rixdix doldy.
At Antonio Babaiotti's door Bloom halts, sweated under the bright arclamps. He disappears. In a moment he reappears and hurries on.)
BLOOM Fish and taters. N. g. Ah!
(He disappears into Olhousen's, the pork butcher's, under the downcoming rollshutter. A few moments later he emerges from under the shutter puffing Poldy, blowing Bloohoom. In each hand he holds a parcel, one containing a lukewarm pig's crubeen, the other a cold sheep's trotter sprinkled with wholepepper He gasps, standing upright. Then bending to one side he presses a parcel against his rib and groans.)
BLOOM Stitch in my side. Why did I run?
(He takes breath with care and goes forward slowly towards the lampset siding. The glow leaps again.)
BLOOM What is that? A flasher? Searchlight.
(He stands at Cormack's corner watching.)
BLOOM Aurora borealis or a steel foundry? Ah, the brigade, of course. South side anyhow. Big blaze. Might be his house. Beggar's bush. We're safe. (He hums cheerfully.) London's burning, London's burning! On fire, on fire! (He catches sight of the navvy lurching through the crowd at the farther side of Talbot street.) I'll miss him. Run. Quick. Better cross here.
(He darts to cross the road. Urchins shout.)
THE URCHINS Mind out, mister! (Two cyclists, with lighted paper lanterns aswing, swim by him, grazing him, their bells rattling.)
THE BELLS Haltyaltyaltyall.
BLOOM (Halts erect stung by a spasm.) Ow.
(He looks round, darts forward suddenly. Through rising fog a dragon sandstrewer, travelling at caution, slews heavily down upon him, its huge red headlight winking, its trolley hissing on the wire. The motorman bangs his footgong.)
THE GONG Bang Bang Bla Bak Blud Bugg Bloo.
(The brake cracks violently. Bloom, raising a policeman's whitegloved hand, blunders stifflegged, out of the track. The motorman thrown forward, pugnosed, on the guidewheel, yells as he slides past over chains and keys.)
THE MOTORMAN Hey, shitbreeches, are you doing the hattrick?
BLOOM (Bloom trickleaps to the curbstone and halts again. He brushes a mudflake from his cheek with a parcelled hand.) No thoroughfare. Close shave that but cured the stitch. Must take up Sandow's exercises again. On the hands down. Insure against street accident too. The Providential. (He feels his trouser pocket.) Poor mamma's panacea. Heel easily catch in tracks or bootlace in a cog. Day the wheel of the black Maria peeled off my shoe at Leonard's corner. Third time is the charm. Shoe trick. Insolent driver. I ought to report him. Tension makes them nervous. Might be the fellow balked me this morning with that horsey woman. Same style of beauty. Quick of him all the same. The stiff walk. True word spoken in jest. That awful cramp in Lad lane. Something poisonous I ate. Emblem of luck. Why? Probably lost cattle. Mark of the beast. (He closes his eyes an instant.) Bit light in the head. Monthly or effect of the other. Brainfogfag. That tired feeling. Too much for me now. Ow!
(A sinister figure leans on plaited legs against O'Beirnes wall, a visage unknown, injected with dark mercury. From under a wideleaved sombrero the figure regards him with evil eye.)
BLOOM Buenos noches, se√±orita Blanca, que calle es esta?
THE FIGURE (Impassive, raises a signal arm.) Password. Sraid Mabbot.
BLOOM Haha. Merci. Esperanto. Slan leath. (He mutters.) Gaelic league spy, sent by that fireeater.
(He steps forward. A sackshouldered ragman bars his path. He steps left, ragsackman left.)
BLOOM I beg. (He swerves, sidles, stepsaside, slips past and on.)
BLOOM Keep to the right, right, right. If there is a fingerpost planted by the Touring Club at Stepaside who procured that public boon? I who lost my way and contributed to the columns of the Irish Cyclist the letter headed, In darkest Stepaside. Keep, keep, keep to the right. Rags and bones, at midnight. A fence more likely. First place murderer makes for. Wash off his sins of the world.
(Jacky Caffrey, hunted by Tommy Caffrey, runs full tilt against Bloom.)
BLOOM O!
(Shocked, on weak hams, he halts. Tommy and Jacky vanish there, there. Bloom pats with parcelled hands watch, fobpocket, bookpocket, pursepocket, sweets of sin, potato soap.)
BLOOM Beware of pickpockets. Old thieves' dodge. Collide. Then snatch your purse.
(The retriever approaches sniffling, nose to the ground. A sprawled form sneezes. A stooped bearded figure appears garbed in the long caftan of an elder in Zion and a smoking cap with magenta tassels. Horned spectacles hang down at the wings of the nose. Yellow poison streaks are on the drawn face.)
RUDOLPH Second halfcrown waste money today. I told you not go with drunken goy ever. So. You catch no money.
BLOOM (Hides the crubeen and trotter behind his back and, crestfallen, feels warm and cold feetmeat) Ja, ich weiss, papachi.
RUDOLPH What you making down this place? Have you no soul? (With feeble vulture talons he feels the silent face of Bloom) Are you not my son Leopold, the grandson of Leopold? Are you not my dear son Leopold who left the house of his father and left the god of his fathers Abraham and Jacob?
BLOOM (With precaution.) I suppose so, father. Mosenthal. All that's left of him.
RUDOLPH (Severely.) One night they bring you home drunk as dog after spend your good money. What you call them running chaps?
BLOOM (In youth's smart blue Oxford suit with white vestslips, narrowshouldered, in brown Alpine hat, wearing gent's sterling silver waterbury keyless watch and double curb Albert with seal attached, one side of him coated with stiffening mud.) Harriers, father. Only that once.
RUDOLPH Once! Mud head to foot. Cut your hand open. Lockjaw. They make you kaput, Leopoldleben. You watch them chaps.
BLOOM (Weakly.) They challenged me to a sprint. It was muddy. I slipped.
RUDOLPH (With contempt) Ooim nachez. Nice spectacles for your poor mother!
BLOOM Mamma!
ELLEN BLOOM (In pantomime dame's stringed mobcap, crinoline and bustle, widow Twankey's blouse with muttonleg sleeves buttoned behind, grey mittens and cameo brooch, her hairplaited in a crisping net, appears over the staircase banisters, a slanted candlestick in her hand and cries out in shrill alarm.) O blessed Redeemer, what have they done to him! My smelling salts! (She hauls up a reef of skirt and ransacks the pouch of her striped blay petticoat. A phial, an Agnus Dei, a shrivelled potato and a celluloid doll fall out.) Sacred Heart of Mary, where were you at all, at all?
(Bloom, mumbling, his eyes downcast, begins to bestow his parcels in his filled pockets but desists, muttering.)
A VOICE (Sharply.) Poldy!
BLOOM Who? (He ducks and wards off a blow clumsily.) At your service.
(He looks up. Beside her mirage of datepalms a handsome woman in Turkish costume stands before him. Opulent curves fill out her scarlet trousers and jacket slashed with gold. A wide yells cummerbund girdles her. A white yashmak violet in the night, covers her face, leaving free only her lace dark eyes and raven hair.)
BLOOM Molly!
MARION Welly? Mrs Marion from this out, my dear man, when you speak to me. (Satirically.) Has poor little hubby cold feet waiting so long?
BLOOM (Shifts from foot to foot.) No, no. Not the least little bit.
(He breathes in deep agitation, swallowing gulps of air questions, hopes, crubeens for her supper things to tell her excuses, desire, spellbound. A coin gleams on her forehead. On her feet are jewelled toerings. Her ankles are linked by a slender fetterchain. Beside her a camel, hooded with a turreting turban, waits. A silk ladder of innumerable rungs climbs to his bobbing howdah. He ambles near with disgruntled hindquarters. Fiercely she slaps his haunch, her goldcurb wristbangles angriling, scolding him in Moorish.)
MARION Nebrakada! Feminimum.
(The camel, lifting a foreleg, plucks from a tree a lace mango fruit, offers it to his mistress, blinking, in his cloven hoof then droops his head and, grunting, with uplifted neck, fumbles to kneel. Bloom stoops his back for leapfrog.)
BLOOM I can give you... I mean as your business menagerer Mrs Marion... if you...
MARION So you notice some change? (Her hands passing slowly over her trinketed stomacher. A slow friendly mockery in her eyes.) O Poldy, Poldy, you are a poor old stick in the mud! Go and see life. See the wide world.
BLOOM I was just going back for that lotion whitewax, orangeflower water. Shop closes early on Thursday. But the first thing in the morning. (He pats divers pockets.) This moving kidney. Ah!
(He points to the south, then to the east. A cake of new clean lemon soap arises, diffusing light and perfume.)
THE SOAP
We're a capital couple are Bloom and I;
He brightens the earth, I polish the sky.

(The freckled face of Sweny, the druggist, appears in the disc of the soapsun.)
SWENY Three and a penny, please.
BLOOM Yes. For my wife, Mrs Marion. Special recipe.
MARION (Softly.) Poldy!
BLOOM Yes, ma'am?
MARION Ti trema un poco il cuore?
(In disdain she saunters away, plump as a pampered pouter pigeon, humming the duet from Don Giovanni)
BLOOM Are you sure about that Voglio? I mean the pronunciati...
(He follows, followed by the sniffing terrier. The elderly bawd seizes his sleeve, the bristles of her chinmole glittering.)
THE BAWD Ten shillings a maidenhead. Fresh thing was never touched. Fifteen. There's no-one in it only her old father that's dead drunk.
(She points. In the gap of her dark den furtive, rainbedraggled Bridie Kelly stands.)
BRIDIE Hatch street. Any good in your mind?
(With a squeak she flaps her bat shawl and runs. A burly rough pursues with booted strides. He stumbles on the steps, recovers, plunges into gloom. Weak squeaks of laughter are heard, weaker.)
THE BAWD (Her wolfeyes shining.) He's getting his pleasure. You won't get a virgin in the flash houses. Ten shillings. Don't be all night before the polis in plain clothes sees us. Sixtyseven is a bitch.
(Leering Gerty MacDowell limps forward. She draws from behind ogling, and shows coyly her bloodied clout.)
GERTY With all my worldly goods I thee and thou. (She murmurs.) You did that. I hate you.
BLOOM I? When? You're dreaming. I never saw you.
THE BAWD Leave the gentleman alone, you cheat. Writing the gentleman false letters. Streetwalking and soliciting. Better for your mother take the strap to you at the bedpost, hussy like you.
GERTY (To Bloom.) When you saw all the secrets of my bottom drawer. (She paws his sleeve, slobbering.) Dirty married man! I love you for doing that to me.
(She slides away crookedly. Mrs Breen in man's frieze overcoat with loose bellows pockets, stands in the causeway, her roguish eyes wideopen, smiling in all her herbivorous buckteeth.)
MRS BREEN Mr.
BLOOM (Coughs gravely.) Madam, when we last had this pleasure by letter dated the sixteenth instant .
MRS BREEN Mr Bloom! You down here in the haunts of sin! I caught you nicely! Scamp!
BLOOM (Hurriedly.) Not so loud my name. Whatever do you think me? Don't give me away. Walls have hears. How do you do? It's ages since I. You're looking splendid. Absolutely it. Seasonable weather we are having this time of year. Black refracts heat. Short cut home here. Interesting quarter. Rescue of fallen women Magdalen asylum. I am the secretary...
MRS BREEN (Holds up a finger.) Now don't tell a big fib! I know somebody won't like that. O just wait till I see Molly! (Slily.) Account for yourself this very minute or woe betide you!
BLOOM (Looks behind.) She often said she'd like to visit. Slumming. The exotic, you see. Negro servants too in livery if she had money. Othello black brute. Eugene Stratton. Even the bones and cornerman at the Livermore christies. Bohee brothers. Sweep for that matter.
(Tom and Sam Bohee, coloured coons in white duck suits, scarlet socks, upstarched Sambo chokers and lace scarlet asters in their buttonholes leap out. Each has his banjo slung. Their paler smaller negroid hands jingle the twingtwang wires. Flashing white Kaffir eyes and tusks they rattle through a breakdown in clumsy clogs, twinging, singing, back to back, toe heel, heel toe, with smackfatclacking nigger lips.)
There's someone in the house with Dina
There's someone in the house, I know,
There's someone in the house with Dina
Playing on the old banjo.

(They whisk black masks from raw babby faces: then, chuckling, chortling, trumming, twanging they diddle diddle cakewalk dance away.)
BLOOM (With a sour tenderish smile.) A little frivol, shall we, if you are so inclined? Would you like me perhaps to embrace you just for a fraction of a second?
MRS BREEN (Screams gaily.) O, you ruck! You ought to see yourself!
BLOOM For old sake'sake. I only meant a square party, a mixed marriage mingling of our different little conjugials. You know I had a soft corner for you. (Gloomily.) 'Twas I sent you that valentine of the dear gazelle.
MRS BREEN Glory Alice, you do look a holy show! Killing simply. (She puts out her hand inquisitively.) What are you hiding behind your back? Tell us, there's a dear.
BLOOM (Seizes her wrist with his free hand.) Josie Powell that was, prettiest deb in Dublin. How time flies by! Do you remember, harking back in a retrospective arrangement, Old Christmas night Georgina Simpson's housewarming while they were playing the Irving Bishop game, finding the pin blindfold and thoughtreading? Subject, what is in this snuff box?
MRS BREEN You were the lion of the night with your seriocomic recitation and you looked the part. You were always a favourite with the ladies.
BLOOM (Squire of dames, in dinner jacket, with watered-silk facings, blue masonic badge in his buttonhole, black bow and mother-of-pearl studs, a prismatic champagne glass tilted in his hand.) Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Ireland, home and beauty.
MRS BREEN The dear dead days beyond recall. Love's old sweet song.
BLOOM (Meaningfully dropping his voice.) I confess I'm teapot with curiosity to find out whether some person's something is a little teapot at present.
MRS BREEN (Gushingly.) Tremendously teapot! London's tea pot and I'm simply teapot all over me. (She rubs sides with him.) After the parlour mystery games and the crackers from the tree we sat on the staircase ottoman. Under the mistletoe. Two is company.
BLOOM (Wearing a purple Napoleon hat with an amber halfmoon, his fingers and thumbs passing slowly down to her soft moist meaty palm which she surrenders gently.) The witching hour of night. I took the splinter out of this hand, carefully, slowly. (Tenderly, as he slips on her finger a ruby ring.) L√† ci darem la mano.
MRS BREEN (In a onepiece eveningfrock executed in moonlight blue, a tinsel sylph's diadem on her brow with her dancecard fallen beside her moonblue satin slipper curves her palm softly, breathing quickly.) Voglio e non. You're hot! You're scalding! The left hand nearest the heart.
BLOOM When you made your present choice they said it was beauty and the beast. I can never forgive you for that. (His clenched fist at his brow.) Think what it means. All you meant to me then. (Hoarsely.) Woman, it's breaking me! (Dennis Breen, whitetallhatted, with Wisdom Hely's sandwich board, shuffles past them in cadet slippers, his dull beard thrust out, muttering to right and left. Little Alf Bergan, cloaked in the pall of the ace of spaces, dogs him to left and right, doubled in laughter.)
ALF BERGAN (Points jeering at the sandwich boards.) U.p.: Up.
MRS BREEN (To Bloom.) High jinks below stairs. (She gives him the glad eye.) Why didn't you kiss the spot to make it well? You wanted to.
BLOOM (Shocked.) Molly's best friend! Could you?
MRS BREEN (Her pulpy tongue between her lips, offers a pigeon kiss.) Hnhn. The answer is a lemon. Have you a little present for me there?
BLOOM (Off handedly.) Kosher. A snack for supper. The home without potted meat is incomplete. I was at Leah. Mrs Bandman Palmer. Trenchant exponent of Shakespeare. Unfortunately threw away the programme. Rattling good place round there for pig's feet. Feel.
(Richie Goulding, three ladies' hats pinned on his head, appears weighted to one side by the black legal bag of Collis and Ward on which a skull and crossbones are painted in white limewash. He ins it and shows it full of polonies, kippered, herrings, Findon haddies and tightpacked pills.)
RICHIE Best value in Dub.
(Bald Pat, bothered beetle, stands on the curbstone, folding his napkin, waiting to wait.)
PAT (Advances with a tilted dish of spillspilling gravy.) Steak and kidney. Bottle of lager. Hee hee hee. Wait till I wait.
RICHIE Goodgod. Inev erate inall...
(With hanging head he marches doggedly forward. The navvy, lurching by, gores him with his flaming pronghorn.)
RICHIE (With a cry of pain, his hand to his back) Ah! Bright's! Lights!
BLOOM (Points to the navvy.) A spy. Don't attract attention. I hate stupid crowds. I am not on pleasure bent. I am in a grave predicament.
MRS BREEN Humbugging and delutbering as per usual with your cock and bull story.
BLOOM I want to tell you a little secret about how I came to be here. But you must never tell. Not even Molly. I have a most particular reason.
MRS BREEN (All agog.) O, not for worlds.
BLOOM Let's walk on. Shall us?
MRS BREEN Let's.
(The bawd makes an unheeded sign. Bloom walks on with Mrs Breen. The terrier follows, whining piteously, wagging his tail.)
THE BAWD Jewman's melt!
BLOOM (In an oatmeal sporting suit, a sprig of woodbine in the lapel, tony buff shirt, shepherd's plaid Saint Andrew's cross scarftie, white spats, fawn dustcoat on his arm, tawny red brogues, fieldglasses in bandolier and a grey billycock hat.) Do you remember a long long time, years and years ago, just after Milly, Marionette we called her, was weaned when we all went together to Fairyhouse races, was it?
MRS BREEN (In smart Saxe tailormade, white velours hat and spider veil.) Leopardstown.
BLOOM I mean, Leopardstown. And Molly won seven shillings on a three year old named Nevertell and coming home along by Foxrock in that old fiveseater shanderadan of a waggonette you were in your heyday then and you had on that new hat of white velours with a surround of molefur that Mrs Hayes advised you to buy because it was marked down to nineteen and eleven, a bit of wire and an old rag of velveteen, and I'll lay you what you like she did it on purpose...
MRS BREEN She did, of course, the cat! Don't tell me! Nice adviser!
BLOOM Because it didn't suit you one quarter as well as the other ducky little tammy toque with the bird of paradise wing in it that I admired on you and you honestly looked just too fetching in it though it was a pity to kill it, you cruel creature, little mite of a thing with a heart the size of a fullstop.
MRS BREEN (Squeezes his arm, simpers.) Naughty cruel I was.
BLOOM (Low, secretly, ever more rapidly.) And Molly was eating a sandwich of spiced beef out of Mrs Joe Gallaher's lunch basket. Frankly, though she had her advisers or admirers, I never cared much for her style. She was .
MRS BREEN Too.
BLOOM Yes. And Molly was laughing because Rogers and Maggot O'Reilly were mimicking a cock as we passed a farmhouse and Marcus Tertius Moses, the tea merchant, drove past us in a gig with his daughter, Dancer Moses was her name, and the poodle in her lap bridled up and you asked me if I ever heard or read or knew or came across .
MRS BREEN (Eagerly.) Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
(She fades from his side. Followed by the whining dog he walks on towards hellsgates. In an archway a standing woman, bent forward, her feet apart, pisses cowily. Outside a shuttered pub a bunch of loiterers listen to a tale which their broken snouted gaffer rasps out with raucous humour. An armless pair of them flop wrestling, growling, in maimed sodden playfight.)
THE GAFFER (Crouches, his voice twisted in his snout.) And when Cairns came down from the scaffolding in Beaver Street what was he after doing it into only into the bucket of porter that was there waiting on the shavings for Derwan's plasterers.
THE LOITERERS (Guffaw with cleft palates.) O jays!
(Their paintspeckled hats wag. Spattered with size and lime of their lodges they frisk limblessly about him.)
BLOOM Coincidence too. They think it funny. Anything but that. Broad daylight. Trying to walk. Lucky no woman.
THE LOITERERS Jays, that's a good one. Glauber salts. O jays, into the men's porter.
(Bloom passes. Cheap whores, singly, coupled, shawled, dishevelled, call from lanes, doors, corners.)

Two tires fly. Two wail.
A bamboo grove, all chopped down
From it, warring songs
....IS THE BEST THAT CORPORAL BOBBY SHAFTOE CAN DO ON short notice--he's standing on the running board, gripping his Springfield with one hand and the rearview mirror with the other, so counting the syllables on his fingers is out of the question. Is ``tires'' one syllable or two? How about ``wail?'' The truck finally makes up its mind not to tip over, and thuds back onto four wheels. The wail--and the moment--are lost. Bobby can still hear the coolies singing, though, and now too there's the gunlike snicking of the truck's clutch linkage as Private Wiley downshifts. Could Wiley be losing his nerve? And, in the back, under the tarps, a ton and a half of file cabinets clanking, code books slaloming, fuel spanking the tanks of Station Alpha's electrical generator. The modern world's hell on haiku writers: ``Electrical generator'' is, what, eight syllables? You couldn't even fit that onto the second line!
""Are we allowed to run over people?'' Private Wiley inquires, and then mashes the horn button before Bobby Shaftoe can answer. A Sikh policeman hurdles a night soil cart. Shaftoe's gut reaction is: Sure, what're they going to do, declare war on us? but as the highest-ranking man on this truck he's probably supposed to be using his head or something, so he doesn't blurt it out just yet. He takes stock of the situation:
Shanghai, 1645 hours, Friday, the 28th of November 1941. Bobby Shaftoe, and the other half-dozen Marines on his truck, are staring down the length of Kiukiang Road, onto which they've just made this careening high-speed turn. Cathedral's going by to the right, so that means they are, what? two blocks away from the Bund. A Yangtze River Patrol gunboat is tied up there, waiting for the stuff they've got in the back of this truck. The only real problem is that those particular two blocks are inhabited by about five million Chinese people.
Now these Chinese are sophisticated urbanites, not suntanned yokels who've never seen cars before--they'll get out of your way if you drive fast and honk your horn. And indeed many of them flee to one side of the street or the other, producing the illusion that the truck its moving faster than the forty-three miles an hour shown on its speedometer.
But the bamboo grove in Bobby Shaftoe's haiku has not been added just to put a little Oriental flavor into the poem and wow the folks back home in Oconomowoc. There is a lot of heavy bamboo in front of this truck, dozens of makeshift turnpikes blocking their path to the river, for the officers of the U.S. Navy's Asiatic Fleet, and of the Fourth Marines, who dreamed up this little operation forgot to take the Friday Afternoon factor into account. As Bobby Shaftoe could've explained to them, if only they'd bothered to ask a poor dumb jarhead, their route took them through the heart of the banking district. Here you've got the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank of course, City Bank, Chase Manhattan, the Bank of America, and BBME and the Agricultural Bank of China and any number of crappy little provincial banks, and several of those banks have contracts with what's left of the Chinese Government to print currency. It must be a cutthroat business because they slash costs by printing it on old newspapers, and if you know how to read Chinese, you can see last year's news stories and polo scores peeking through the colored numbers and pictures that transform these pieces of paper into legal tender.
As every chicken-peddler and rickshaw operator in Shanghai knows, the money-printing contracts stipulate that all of the bills these banks print have to be backed by such-and-such an amount of silver; i.e., anyone should be able to walk into one of those banks at the end of Kiukiang Road and slap down a pile of bills and (provided that those bills were printed by that same bank) receive actual metallic silver in exchange.
Now if China weren't right in the middle of getting systematically drawn and quartered by the Empire of Nippon, it would probably send official bean counters around to keep tabs on how much silver was actually present in these banks' vaults, and it would all be quiet and orderly. But as it stands, the only thing keeping these banks honest is the other banks.
Here's how they do it: during the normal course of business, lots of paper money will pass over the counters of (say) Chase Manhattan Bank. They'll take it into a back room and sort it, throwing into money boxes (a couple of feet square and a yard deep, with ropes on the four corners) all of the bills that were printed by (say) Bank of America in one, all of the City Bank bills into another. Then, on Friday afternoon they will bring in coolies. Each coolie, or pair of coolies, will of course have his great big long bamboo pole with him--a coolie without his pole is like a China Marine without his nickel-plated bayonet--and will poke their pole through the ropes on the corners of the box. Then one coolie will get underneath each end of the pole, hoisting the box into the air. They have to move in unison or else the box begins flailing around and everything gets out of whack. So as they head towards their destination--whatever bank whose name is printed on the bills in their box--they sing to each other, and plant their feet on the pavement in time to the music. The pole's pretty long, so they are that far apart, and they have to sing loud to hear each other, and of course each pair of coolies in the street is singing their own particular song, trying to drown out all of the others so that they don't get out of step.
So ten minutes before closing time on Friday afternoon, the doors of many banks burst open and numerous pairs of coolies march in singing, like the curtain-raiser on a fucking Broadway musical, slam their huge boxes of tattered currency down, and demand silver in exchange. All of the banks do this to each other. Sometimes, they'll all do it on the same Friday, particularly at times like 28 November 1941, when even a grunt like Bobby Shaftoe can understand that it's better to be holding silver than piles of old cut-up newspaper. And that is why, once the normal pedestrians and food-cart operators and furious Sikh cops have scurried out of the way, and plastered themselves up against the clubs and shops and bordellos on Kiukiang Road, Bobby Shaftoe and the other Marines on the truck still cannot even see the gunboat that is their destination, because of this horizontal forest of mighty bamboo poles. They cannot even hear the honking of their own truck horn because of the wild throbbing pentatonic cacophony of coolies singing. This ain't just your regular Friday P.M. Shanghai bank-district money-rush. This is an ultimate settling of accounts before the whole Eastern Hemisphere catches fire. The millions of promises printed on those slips of bumwad will all be kept or broken in the next ten minutes; actual pieces of silver and gold will move, or they won't. It is some kind of fiduciary Judgment Day.
``Jesus Christ, I can't--'' Private Wiley hollers.
""The captain said don't stop for any reason whatsofuckinever,'' Shaftoe reminds him. He's not telling Wiley to run over the coolies, he's reminding Wiley that if he refrains from running over them, they will have some explaining to do--which will be complicated by the fact that the captain's right behind them in a car stuffed with Tommy Gun-toting China Marines. And from the way the captain's been acting about this Station Alpha thing, it's pretty clear that he already has a few preliminary strap marks on his ass, courtesy of some admiral in Pearl Harbor or even (drumroll) Marine Barracks, Eight and Eye Streets Southeast, Washington, D.C.
Shaftoe and the other Marines have always known Station Alpha as a mysterious claque of pencil-necked swabbies who hung out on the roof of a building in the International Settlement in a shack of knot-pocked cargo pallet planks with antennas sticking out of it every which way. If you stood there long enough you could see some of those antennas moving, zeroing in on something out to sea. Shaftoe even wrote a haiku about it:
Antenna searches
Retriever's nose in the wind
Ether's far secrets
This was only his second haiku ever--clearly not up to November 1941 standards--and he cringes to remember it.
But in no way did any of the Marines comprehend what a big deal Station Alpha was until today. Their job had turned out to involve wrapping a ton of equipment and several tons of paper in tarps and moving it out of doors. Then they spent Thursday tearing the shack apart, making it into a bonfire, and burning certain books and papers.
``Sheeeyit!'' Private Wiley hollers. Only a few of the coolies have gotten out of the way, or even seen them. But then there is this fantastic boom from the river, like the sound of a mile-thick bamboo pole being snapped over God's knee. Half a second later there're no coolies in the street anymore--just a lot of boxes with unmanned bamboo poles teeter-tottering on them, bonging into the streets like wind-chimes. Above, a furry mushroom of grey smoke rises from the gunboat. Wiley shifts up to high gear and floors it. Shaftoe cringes against the truck's door and lowers his head, hoping that his campy Great War doughboy helmet will be good for something. Then money-boxes start to rupture and explode as the truck rams through them. Shaftoe peers up through a blizzard of notes and sees giant bamboo poles soaring and bounding and windmilling toward the waterfront.
The leaves of Shanghai:
Pale doorways in a steel sky.
Winter has begun.

BARRENS
Let's set the existence-of-god issue aside for a later volume, and just stipulate that in some way, self-replicating organisms came into existence on this planet and immediately began trying to get rid of each other, either by spamming their environments with rough copies of themselves, or by more direct means which hardly need to be belabored. Most of them failed, and their genetic legacy was erased from the universe forever, but a few found some way to survive and to propagate. After about three billion years of this sometimes zany, frequently tedious fugue of carnality and carnage, Godfrey Waterhouse IV was born, in Murdo, South Dakota, to Blanche, the wife of a Congregational preacher named Bunyan Waterhouse. Like every other creature on the face of the earth, Godfrey was, by birthright, a stupendous badass, albeit in the somewhat narrow technical sense that he could trace his ancestry back up a long line of slightly less highly evolved stupendous badasses to that first self-replicating gizmo--which, given the number and variety of its descendants, might justifiably be described as the most stupendous badass of all time. Everyone and everything that wasn't a stupendous badass was dead.

As nightmarishly lethal, memetically programmed death-machines went, these were the nicest you could ever hope to meet. In the tradition of his namesake (the Puritan writer John Bunyan, who spent much of his life in jail, or trying to avoid it) the Rev. Waterhouse did not preach in any one place for long. The church moved him from one small town in the Dakotas to another every year or two. It is possible that Godfrey found the lifestyle more than a little alienating, for, sometime during the course of his studies at Fargo Congregational College, he bolted from the fold and, to the enduring agony of his parents, fell into worldy pursuits, and ended up, somehow, getting a Ph.D. in Classics from a small private university in Ohio. Academics being no less nomadic than Congregational preachers, he took work where he could find it. He became a Professor of Greek and Latin at Bolger Christian College (enrollment 322) in West Point, Virginia, where the Mattaponi and Pamunkey Rivers came together to form the estuarial James, and the loathsome fumes of the big paper mill permeated every drawer, every closet, even the interior pages of books. Godfrey's young bride, nee Alice Pritchard, who had grown up following her itinerant-preacher father across the vastnesses of eastern Montana--where air smelt of snow and sage--threw up for three months. Six months later she gave birth to Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse.

The boy had a peculiar relationship with sound. When a fire engine passed, he was not troubled by the siren's howl or the bell's clang. But when a hornet got into the house and swung across the ceiling in a broad Lissajous, droning almost inaudibly, he cried in pain at the noise. And if he saw or smelled something that scared him, he would clap his hands over his ears.

One noise that troubled him not at all was the pipe organ in the chapel at Bolger Christian College. The chapel itself was nothing worth mentioning, but the organ had been endowed by the paper mill family and would have sufficed for a church four times the size. It nicely complemented the organist, a retired high school math teacher who felt that certain attributes of the Lord (violence and capriciousness in the Old Testament, majesty and triumph in the New) could be directly conveyed into the souls of the enpewed sinners through a kind of frontal sonic impregnation. That he ran the risk of blowing out the stained-glass windows was of no consequence since no one liked them anyway, and the paper mill fumes were gnawing at the interstitial lead. But after one little old lady too many staggered down the aisle after a service, reeling from tinnitus, and made a barbed comment to the minister about the exceedingly dramatic music, the organist was replaced.
Nevertheless, he continued to give lessons on the instrument. Students were not allowed to touch the organ until they were proficient at the piano, and when this was explained to Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse, he taught himself, in three weeks, how to play a Bach fugue, and signed up for organ lessons. Since he was only five years old at the time, he was unable to reach both the manuals and the pedals, and had to play standing--or rather strolling, from pedal to pedal.
When Lawrence was twelve, the organ broke down. That paper mill family had not left any endowment for maintenance, so the math teacher decided to have a crack at it. He was in poor health and required a nimble assistant: Lawrence, who helped him open up the hood of the thing. For the first time in all those years, the boy saw what had been happening when he had been pressing those keys.
For each stop--each timbre, or type of sound, that the organ could make (viz. blockflote, trumpet, piccolo)--there was a separate row of pipes, arranged in a line from long to short. Long pipes made low notes, short high. The tops of the pipes defined a graph: not a straight line but an upward-tending curve. The organist/math teacher sat down with a few loose pipes, a pencil, and paper, and helped Lawrence figure out why. When Lawrence understood, it was as if the math teacher had suddenly played the good part of Bach's Fantasia and Fugue in G Minor on a pipe organ the size of the Spiral Nebula in Andromeda--the part where Uncle Johann dissects the architecture of the Universe in one merciless descending ever-mutating chord, as if his foot is thrusting through skidding layers of garbage until it finally strikes bedrock. In particular, the final steps of the organist's explanation were like a falcon's dive through layer after layer of pretense and illusion, thrilling or sickening or confusing depending on what you were. The heavens were riven open. Lawrence glimpsed choirs of angels ranking off into geometrical infinity.
The pipes sprouted in parallel ranks from a broad flat box of compressed air. All of the pipes for a given note--but belonging to different stops--lined up with each other along one axis. All of the pipes for a given stop--but tuned at different pitches--lined up with each other along the other, perpendicular axis. Down there in the flat box of air, then, was a mechanism that got air to the right pipes at the right times. When a key or pedal was depressed, all of the pipes capable of sounding the corresponding note would speak, as long as their stops were pulled out.
Mechanically, all of this was handled in a fashion that was perfectly clear, simple, and logical. Lawrence had supposed that the machine must be at least as complicated as the most intricate fugue that could be played on it. Now he had learned that a machine, simple in its design, could produce results of infinite complexity.
Stops were rarely used alone. They tended to be piled on top of each other in combinations that were designed to take advantage of the available harmonics (more tasty mathematics here!). Certain combinations in particular were used over and over again. Lots of blockflo[autes, in varying lengths, for the quiet Offertory, for example. The organ included an ingenious mechanism called the preset, which enabled the organist to select a particular combination of stops--stops he himself had chosen--instantly. He would punch a button and several stops would bolt out from the console, driven by pneumatic pressure, and in that instant the organ would become a different instrument with entirely new timbres.
The next summer both Lawrence and Alice, his mother, were colonized by a distant cousin--a stupendous badass of a virus. Lawrence escaped from it with an almost imperceptible tendency to drag one of his feet. Alice wound up in an iron lung. Later, unable to cough effectively, she got pneumonia and died.
Lawrence's father Godfrey freely confessed that he was not equal to the burdens now laid on his shoulders. He resigned from his position at the small college in Virginia and moved, with his son, to a small house in Moorhead, Minnesota, next door to where Bunyan and Blanche had settled. Later he got a job teaching at a nearby normal school.
At this point, all of the responsible adults in Lawrence's life seemed to arrive at a tacit agreement that the best way to raise him--certainly the easiest--was to leave him alone. On the rare occasions when Lawrence requested adult intervention in his life, he was usually asking questions that no one could answer. At the age of sixteen, having found nothing in the local school system to challenge him, Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse went off to college. He matriculated at Iowa State College, which among other things was the site of a Naval ROTC installation in which he was forcibly enrolled.
The Iowa State Naval ROTC had a band, and was delighted to hear that Lawrence had an interest in music. Since it was hard to drill on the deck of a dreadnought while playing a pipe organ, they issued him a glockenspiel and a couple of little dingers.
When not marching back and forth on the flood plain of the Skunk River making loud dinging noises, Lawrence was majoring in mechanical engineering. He ended up doing poorly in this area because he had fallen in with a Bulgarian professor named John Vincent Atanasoff and his graduate student, Clifford Berry, who were building a machine that was intended to automate the solution of some especially tedious differential equations.
The basic problem for Lawrence was that he was lazy. He had figured out that everything was much simpler if, like Superman with his X-ray vision, you just stared through the cosmetic distractions and saw the underlying mathematical skeleton. Once you found the math in a thing, you knew everything about it, and you could manipulate it to your heart's content with nothing more than a pencil and a napkin. He saw it in the curve of the silver bars on his glockenspiel, saw it in the catenary arch of a bridge and in the capacitor-studded drum of Atanasoff and Berry's computing machine. Actually pounding on the glockenspiel, riveting the bridge together, or trying to figure out why the computing machine wasn't working were not as interesting to him.
Consequently he got poor grades. From time to time, though, he would perform some stunt on the blackboard that would leave his professor weak in the knees and the other students baffled and hostile. Word got around.
At the same time, his grandmother Blanche was invoking her extensive Congregational connections, working the angles on Lawrence's behalf, totally unbeknownst to him. Her efforts culminated in triumph when Lawrence was awarded an obscure scholarship, endowed by a St. Paul oat-processing heir, whose purpose was to send Midwestern Congregationalists to the Ivy League for one year, which (evidently) was deemed a long enough period of time to raise their IQs by a few crucial points but not long enough to debauch them. So Lawrence got to be a sophomore in Princeton.
Now Princeton was an august school and going there was a great honor, but no one got around to mentioning either of these facts to Lawrence, who had no way of knowing. This had bad and good consequences. He accepted the scholarship with a faintness of gratitude that infuriated the oat lord. On the other hand, he adjusted to Princeton easily because it was just another place. It reminded him of the nicer bits of Virginia, and there were some nice pipe organs in town, though he was not all that happy with his engineering homework of bridge-designing and sprocket-cutting problems. As always, these eventually came down to math, most of which he could handle easily. From time to time he would get stuck, though, which led him to the Fine Hall: the headquarters of the Math Department.
There was a motley assortment of fellows wandering around in Fine Hall, many sporting British or European accents. Administratively speaking, many of these fellows were not members of the Math Department at all, but a separate thing called IAS, which stood for Institute for Advanced something-or-other. But they were all in the same building and they all knew a thing or two about math, so the distinction didn't exist for Lawrence.
Quite a few of these men would pretend shyness when Lawrence sought their advice, but others were at least willing to hear him out. For example: he had come up with a way to solve a difficult sprocket tooth shape problem that, as normally solved by engineers, would require any number of perfectly reasonable but aesthetically displeasing approximations. Lawrence's solution would provide exact results. The only drawback was that it would require a quintillion slide-rule operators a quintillion years to solve. Lawrence was working on a radically different approach that, if it worked, would bring those figures down to a trillion and a trillion respectively. Unfortunately, Lawrence was unable to interest anyone at Fine Hall in anything as prosaic as gears, until all of a sudden he made friends with an energetic British fellow, whose name he promptly forgot, but who had been doing a lot of literal sprocket-making himself lately. This fellow was trying to build, of all things, a mechanical calculating machine--specifically a machine to calculate certain values of the Riemann Zeta Function.

certain values of the Riemann Zeta Function.

where s is a complex number.
Lawrence found this zeta function to be no more and no less interesting than any other math problem until his new friend assured him that it was frightfully important, and that some of the best mathematicians in the world had been gnawing on it for decades. The two of them ended up staying awake until three in the morning working out the solution to Lawrence's sprocket problem. Lawrence presented the results proudly to his engineering professor, who snidely rejected it, on grounds of practicality, and gave him a poor grade for his troubles.
Lawrence finally remembered, after several more contacts, that the name of the friendly Brit was Al something-or-other. Because Al was a passionate cyclist, he and Al went on quite a few bicycle rides through the countryside of the Garden State. As they rode around New Jersey, they talked about math, and particularly about machines for taking the dull part of math off their hands.
But Al had been thinking about this subject for longer than Lawrence, and had figured out that computing machines were much more than just labor-saving devices. He'd been working on a radically different sort of computing mechanism that would work out any arithmetic problem whatsoever, as long as you knew how to write the problem down. From a pure logic standpoint, he had already figured out everything there was to know about this (as yet hypothetical) machine, though he had yet to build one. Lawrence gathered that actually building machinery was looked on as undignified at Cambridge (England, that is, where this Al character was based) or for that matter at Fine Hall. Al was thrilled to have found, in Lawrence, someone who did not share this view.
Al delicately asked him, one day, if Lawrence would terribly mind calling him by his full and proper name, which was Alan and not Al. Lawrence apologized and said he would try very hard to keep it in mind.
One day a couple of weeks later, as the two of them sat by a running stream in the woods above the Delaware Water Gap, Alan made some kind of an outlandish proposal to Lawrence involving penises. It required a great deal of methodical explanation, which Alan delivered with lots of blushing and stuttering. He was ever so polite, and several times emphasized that he was acutely aware that not everyone in the world was interested in this sort of thing.
Lawrence decided that he was probably one of those people.
Alan seemed vastly impressed that Lawrence had paused to think about it at all and apologized for putting him out. They went directly back to a discussion of computing machines, and their friendship continued unchanged. But on their next bicycle ride--an overnight camping trip to the Pine Barrens--they were joined by a new fellow, a German named Rudy von something-or-other.
Alan and Rudy's relationship seemed closer, or at least more multilayered, than Alan and Lawrence's. Lawrence concluded that Alan's penis scheme must have finally found a taker.
It got Lawrence to thinking. From an evolution standpoint, what was the point of having people around who were not inclined to have offspring? There must be some good, and fairly subtle, reason for it.
The only thing he could work out was that it was groups of people--societies--rather than individual creatures, who were now trying to out-reproduce and/or kill each other, and that, in a society, there was plenty of room for someone who didn't have kids as long as he was up to something useful.
Alan and Rudy and Lawrence rode south, anyway, looking for the Pine Barrens. After a while the towns became very far apart, and the horse farms gave way to a low stubble of feeble, spiny trees that appeared to extend all the way to Florida--blocking their view, but not the headwind. ``Where are the Pine Barrens I wonder?'' Lawrence asked a couple of times. He even stopped at a gas station to ask someone that question. His companions began to make fun of him.
``Vere are ze Pine Barrens?'' Rudy inquired, looking about quizzically.
``I should look for something rather barren-looking, with numerous pine trees,'' Alan mused.
There was no other traffic and so they had spread out across the road to pedal three abreast, with Alan in the middle.
``A forest, as Kafka would imagine it,'' Rudy muttered.
By this point Lawrence had figured out that they were, in fact, in the Pine Barrens. But he didn't know who Kafka was. ``A mathematician?'' he guessed.
``Zat is a scary sing to sink of,'' Rudy said.
``He is a writer,'' Alan said. ``Lawrence, please don't be offended that I ask you this, but: do you recognize any other people's names at all? Other than family and close friends, I mean.''
Lawrence must have looked baffled. ``I'm trying to figure out whether it all comes from in here,'' Alan said, reaching out to rap his knuckles on the side of Lawrence's head, ``or do you sometimes take in new ideas from other human beings?''

``When I was a little boy, I saw angels in a church in Virginia,'' Lawrence said, ``but I think that they came from inside my head.''
``Very well,'' Alan said.
But later Alan had another go at it. They had reached the fire lookout tower and it had been a thunderous disappointment: just an alienated staircase leading nowhere, and a small cleared area below that was glittery with shards of liquor bottles. They pitched their tent by the side of a pond that turned out to be full of rust-colored algae that stuck to the hairs on their bodies. Then there was nothing left to do but drink schnapps and talk about math.

Alan said, ``Look, it's like this: Bertrand Russell and another chap named Whitehead wrote Principia Mathematica...''

``Now I know you're pulling my leg,'' Waterhouse said. ``Even I know that Sir Isaac Newton wrote that.''

``Newton wrote a different book, also called Principia Mathematica, which isn't really about mathematics at all; it's about what we would today call physics.''

``Then why did he call it Principia Mathematica?''

``Because the distinction between mathematics and physics wasn't especially clear in Newton's day--''

``Or maybe even in zis day,'' Rudy said.

``--which is directly relevant to what I'm talking about,'' Alan continued. ``I am talking about Russell's P.M., in which he and Whitehead started absolutely from scratch, I mean from nothing, and built it all up--all mathematics--from a small number of first principles. And why I am telling you this, Lawrence, is that--Lawrence! Pay attention!''

``Hmmm?''

``Rudy--take this stick, here--that's right--and keep a close eye on Lawrence, and when he gets that foggy look on his face, poke him with it!''

``Zis is not an English school, you can't do zese kind of sing.''

``I'm listening,'' Lawrence said.

``What came out of P.M., which was terrifically radical, was the ability to say that all of math, really, can be expressed as a certain ordering of symbols.''
``Leibniz said it a long time before zen!'' protested Rudy.
``Er, Leibniz invented the notation we use for calculus, but--''
``I'm not talking about zat!''
``And he invented matrices, but--''
``I'm not talking about zat eezer!''
``And he did some work with binary arithmetic, but--''
``Zat is completely different!''
``Well, what the hell are you talking about, then, Rudy?''
``Leibniz invented ze basic alphabet--wrote down a set of symbols, for expressing statements about logic.''
``Well, I wasn't aware that Herr Leibniz counted formal logic among his interests, but--''
``Of course! He wanted to do what Russell and Whitehead did, except not just with mathematics, but with everything in ze whole world!''
``Well from the fact that you are the only man on the planet, Rudy, who seems to know about this undertaking of Leibniz's, can we assume that he failed?''
``You can assume anything that pleases your fancy, Alan,'' Rudy responded, ``but I am a mathematician and I do not assume anything.''
Alan sighed woundedly, and gave Rudy a Significant Look which Waterhouse assumed meant that there would be trouble later. ``If I may just make some headway, here,'' he said, ``all I'm really trying to get you to agree on, is that mathematics can be expressed as a series of symbols,'' (he snatched the Lawrence-poking stick and began drawing things like  the dirt) ``and frankly I could not care less whether they happen to be Leibniz's symbols, or Russell's, or the hexagrams of the I Ching....''
``Leibniz was fascinated by the I Ching!'' Rudy began.
``Shut up about Leibniz for a moment, Rudy, because look here: You--Rudy--and I are on a train, as it were, sitting in the dining car, having a nice conversation, and that train is being pulled along at a terrific clip by certain locomotives named The Bertrand Russell and Riemann and Euler and others. And our friend Lawrence is running alongside the train, trying to keep up with us--it's not that we're smarter than he is, necessarily, but that he's a farmer who didn't get a ticket. And I, Rudy, am simply reaching out through the open window here, trying to pull him onto the fucking train with us so that the three of us can have a nice little chat about mathematics without having to listen to him panting and gasping for breath the whole way.''
``All right, Alan.''
``Won't take a minute if you will just stop interrupting.''
``But there is a locomotive too named Leibniz.''
``Is it that you don't think I give enough credit to Germans? Because I am about to mention a fellow with an umlaut.''
``Oh, would it be Herr Turing?'' Rudy said slyly.
``Herr Turing comes later. I was actually thinking of Godel.''
``But he's not German! He's Austrian!''
``I'm afraid that it's all the same now, isn't it?''

ELLIOT (Voiceover): Hello friend. Hello friend? That‚Äôs lame. Maybe I should give you a name? But that‚Äôs a slippery slope. You‚Äôre only in my head. We have to remember that. Shit. It‚Äôs actually happened. I‚Äôm talking to an imaginary person.
Within the black of frame, silhouettes begin forming.
ELLIOT (V.O.): What I'm about to tell you is top-secret.
We pull out to reveal we‚Äôre in an office looking out of a very tall Manhattan skyscraper. Shadowy figures sit and stand around a conference table, arguing.
ELLIOT (V.O.): A conspiracy bigger than all of us. There's a powerful group of people out there who are secretly running the world.
ELLIOT (V.O.): I'm talking about the guys that no one knows about. The guys that are invisible. The top 1% of the top 1%. The guys that play God without permission.
CUT TO BLACK.
ELLIOT (V.O.): And now I think they‚Äôre following me.
INT. NYC SUBWAY (MOVING) - MORNING
We finally meet ELLIOT (late 20s). His hoodie throws a sliced shadow over his face.
He sneaks looks at a couple of mysterious MEN DRESSED IN BLACK, one on either side of the train. One reads the NY Post. The other looks straight ahead, suspiciously so.
ELLIOT (V.O.): This is about last night. I should have gone to Angela‚Äôs birthday party. Instead I went to--
INT. RON‚ÄôS COFFEE (FLASHBACK) - NIGHT
A large coffee shop with a fair amount of patrons. A cheesy sign that reads ‚ÄúRon's Coffee‚Äù displays on the door. Elliot sits by himself, hoodie on, no coffee. His leg taps nervously.
Elliot intently watches as a mild-mannered Indian with a mustache walks into the shop. This is RON (40s-50s).
He orders a latte from the front and sits alone. He pulls out his iPad and sips his latte, enjoying the quiet evening to himself.
Elliot musters courage with a deep breath and walks over. He sits across from him without saying a word, his leg twitching.
RON stares at him.
ELLIOT: You're Ron.
He nervously gestures to the cheesy sign. Confused, Ron glares at him in response.
ELLIOT (nervous and robotic): But your real name is Rohit Mehta. You changed it to Ron when you bought your first Ron‚Äôs Coffee shop six years ago. Now you got 17 of 'em with 8 more coming next quarter.
An awkward silence. Ron tilts his head, not sure if he should be flattered or concerned.
RON (thick Indian accent): May I help you with something?
ELLIOT: I like coming here 'cause your Wi-Fi was fast. I mean, you're one of the few spots that has a fiber connection with gigabit speed. It's good. So good, it scratched that part of my mind, part that doesn't allow good to exist without condition, so I started intercepting all the traffic on your network. That's when I noticed something strange. It's when I decided to hack you.
Another awkward silence. Ron leans forward.
RON: Hack--
ELLIOT: I know you run a website - called Plato's Boys.
Alarms suddenly go off in Ron‚Äôs world.
RON: Pardon me?
ELLIOT: You're using Tor networking to keep the servers anonymous. You made it really hard for anyone to see it, but I saw it.
Even though Elliot came off a little amateurish at first, his confidence builds as he continues to talk.
ELLIOT: The onion routing protocol, it's not as anonymous as you think it is. Whoever's in control of the exit nodes is also in control of the traffic, which makes me...the one in control.
RON: I must ask you to kindly leave--
Elliot pulls out a thick folder of files and places it on the table.
ELLIOT: I own everything. All your emails. All your files. All your pics.
Ron flips through a few pages then slaps the folder close.
RON (angry): Get out of here right now, or I'll call the--
ELLIOT: Police? You want them to find out about the 100 terabytes of child pornography you serve to your 400,000 users?
Ron is stunned silent. Ron looks down, cornered and speechless. Elliot looks genuinely sympathetic.
ELLIOT: Personally, man, I was hoping it was just gonna be some BDSM stuff. You realize how much simpler that would have been?
RON: I did not hurt anyone. I never did. That's my personal life.
All the blood in Phil‚Äôs face as drained. Emotion begins to fill his face. Elliot looks at him, a mix of pity and guilt.
ELLIOT: I understand what it's like to be different. I'm very different too. I mean, I don't jerk off to little kids, but I don't know how to talk to people. My dad was the only one I could talk to. But he died.
At first, Ron is unsure on how to proceed. But sensing an opportunity, he takes a deep breath and nods sympathetically.
RON: I'm sorry to hear that. How did he pass, may I ask?
ELLIOT: Leukemia. He definitely got it from radiation at the company he worked at, though I couldn't prove it. Now he's dead. Company's fine, though.
Ron can‚Äôt help but start crying. Elliot genuinely feels for him.
ELLIOT: Oh hey. It's okay, Rohit. You don't have to worry anymore.
Ron looks up, confused.
RON (confused then angry): I don't understand. Are you blackmailing me? So that's what this is about money. That's all you care about, huh? No. If I pay you now, you'll want more and more. No matter how much I give. You will inform the police anyway. I won't pay you, sir. Remember, you also broke the law.
Elliot nods agreeingly. He looks out the windows, as if looking for something.
ELLIOT: Actually, you're right. Partly. See, I usually do this kind of thing from my computer, but this time I wanted to do it AFK. In person. Trying to work on my social anxiety. But there's always the threat of you fleeing after I call you out.
Elliot leans over and begins to zip up his bag, getting ready to stand.
ELLIOT: You'd tell your sys admin to take your servers down, wipe all the data.
Elliot stands, putting his oversized bookbag on.
ELLIOT: So I made sure to include the current time and and location on my anonymous tip.
Ron stands up with Elliot.
RON (desperate, nervous): Wait. Hold on. I'll give you the money. I'll pay you. How much do you want? I'll pay you.
Sirens can be heard. Lights swirl outside the windows.
ELLIOT: That's the part you were wrong about, Rohit. I don't give a shit about money.
POLICE race into the shop as Elliot breezes past them, heading out, leaving the chaos to surround the destroyed Phil.
Violent jazz slowly BUILDS on the soundtrack.
TITLE SEQUENCE
INT. NYC SUBWAY (MOVING) - MORNING
Back to present day, Elliot snaps awake. He eyes the two MEN IN BLACK who still sneak looks at him.
ELLIOT (V.O.): Now I'm being followed. The higher ups don't like someone with my powers. In three short minutes, I destroyed a man's business, life, existence. I deleted him.
On the far end of the packed train, a dark-haired man YAWNS loudly. He looks like a disheveled Californian who‚Äôs been forced to relocate. He wears cargo pants and what looks like a gas attendant shirt that reads: Computer Repair With A Smile. Below it, a logo reads MR. ROBOT (40s). He looks at Elliot with a stoner‚Äôs smile as he brushes his scraggly beard. Elliot doesn‚Äôt smile back. Across the crowd of people, the man shouts:
MR. ROBOT: Hey! Hey, you. Hey, kiddo. What's happening?
Elliot doesn‚Äôt answer. Instead, he looks away, pretending he didn‚Äôt hear him.
MR. ROBOT: Exciting time in the world right now. Exciting time.
Mr. Robot lies on his back, returning to his homeless slumber.
EXT. NYC STREETS - LATER
Elliot walks through the crowded streets of New York, carefully avoiding the touch of other humans. He carries a huge bookbag on his back.
INT. ALLSAFE OFFICES - LATER
He walks into the modest offices of AllSafe Cybersecurity, as announced by the boring, corporate logo.
ELLIOT (V.O.): But I'm only a vigilante hacker by night. By day, just a regular cyber security engineer, employee number ER28-0652.
INT. ALLSAFE OFFICES - GIDEON‚ÄôS OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
The AllSafe boss, GIDEON GODDARD (40s), a bearded metrosexual with adult braces stands while ANGELA (20s), a blonde girl-nextdoor trapped in the prim and proper veneer of a private school upbringing, looks at him sternly. Gideon shouts through his glass doors:
GIDEON: Elliot, in here!

Angela: ...All over the price. Yeah, I can totally, I can totally handle it.
GIDEON: Look--
Elliot nervously walks in, curiously looking at Angela who pretends he‚Äôs not even there. Gideon passes a file to him.
GIDEON: They were hacked again. Last night.
ANGELA: Gideon--
ELLIOT (V.O.): That's my childhood friend Angela. She can be a bit high strung sometimes, but trust me she's one of the good ones.
Elliot looks over the notes.
ELLIOT: What am I looking at? Is this the log file? This was a RUDY attack.
Concerned, Gideon nods. Elliot shakes his head, impressed more than he usually is.
ELLIOT: This is awesome.
ANGELA: Gideon, will you please answer me?
GIDEON (to ELLIOT): Awesome? You think this is awesome? This is killing us, Elliot.
ANGELA: Gideon, I'm not leaving--
GIDEON: Angela! Let's just see how this meeting goes today. Their networks are getting attacked every week. Who knows if they'll still even be a client.
ELLIOT: They‚Äôre coming in?
Gideon‚Äôs look confirms it. He looks at Elliot‚Äôs hoodie.
GIDEON: Hey, what did we say about the dress code?
Elliot sheds his hoodie, revealing an oversized, button-downed dress shirt underneath. He hates it.
GIDEON: All right, now, look over those logs. And be ready this afternoon in case they have any questions. Okay?
ANGELA: Okay
INT. ALLSAFE OFFICES - HALLWAYS
Elliot and Angela walk out. Elliot smells something on her.
ELLIOT: Start smoking again?
ANGELA (ignores his question): Did you not get my texts last night? I sent you exactly 13 of them.
ELLIOT: Yeah, I'm sorry. I couldn't make it.
ANGELA (looks at him): You promised me that you were gonna try this time.
FLASHBACK
Last night, Elliot nervously walks up to the entrance of a packed bar. Through the big windows outside he sees Angela, laughing, smiling, drinking with friends. Elliot‚Äôs hand goes for the door, but his hand trembles--
ANGELA: Stop thinking about something else when I'm talking to you. I hate when you do that.
ELLIOT: Sorry, I was thinking about work.
ANGELA: Maybe that's why Gideon loves you so much. He thanks me all the time for bringing you in. But for some reason, I think you secretly hate it here.
ELLIOT (V.O.): She was right. I liked most of the people, but our business--a cyber security firm that protects corporations--I can't think of anything I hate more.
ELLIOT: No, I love it here.
Elliot and Angela both chuckle.
ANGELA: I'm sorry. I'm just in a bad mood. I'm late on my last two student loan payments, and I can't get Gideon to give me a raise.
A slick, good-looking white man named OLLIE (20s) walks up and kisses Angela.
OLLIE (to Angela): Hey.
ANGELA (to Ollie): Hi.
OLLIE (to Elliot): Yo, buddy. Missed you last night. Where were you?
ELLIOT: Gotta go, big meeting today.
Elliot doesn‚Äôt wait for a response, he disappears into the maze of cubicles quickly.
OLLIE (to Angela): Did you find out what happened?
ANGELA: Yeah. He said he was working.
OLLIE (not buying it): Oh, come on. You gotta talk to him.
ANGELA (rolls her eyes): We‚Äôre gonna be late for the staff meeting.
OLLIE: He can't stand me. And you know why. Angela, I can't have that kind of negativity in my life--
Angela glares at him. Ollie points.
OLLIE: That's exactly what I'm talking about.
EXT. NEW YORK STREETS - DAY
Elliot shiftlessly walks through the streets once again, big bookbag in tow. His eyes wander around in paranoia. He continues to eat his McDonald‚Äôs fries from the bag.
INT. PSYCHOLOGIST‚ÄôS OFFICE - DAY
He sits across from his psychologist, KRISTA (30s-40s), a slender African-American woman who tries too hard at youth with a short dress.
They‚Äôre looking at each other in silence.
KRISTA: What are you thinking about?
ELLIOT: Nothing.
KRISTA: Wanna know what I‚Äôm thinking about? The first time you came to me.
ELLIOT (V.O.): I didn't exactly come to Krista. I was forced here. But I do like her. Hacking her was simple. Her password: Dylan 2791. Favorite artist and the year in which she was born, backwards. Though she's a psychologist, she's really bad at reading people. But I'm good at reading people. My secret: I look for the worst in them.
INSERT: Krista‚Äôs Gmail and Facebook. We land on her eHarmony profile.
ELLIOT (V.O): I know she went through a divorce four years ago. I know she was devastated by it and has been dating losers on eHarmony ever since.
INSERT: A profile pic of a salt and pepper handsome gent. He‚Äôs a nice fellow with a middle-aged face and a welcoming smile. His name is listed as Michael Hansen.
ELLIOT (V.O.): Her most recent foray Michael Hansen. I searched for him online, but nothing came up. No LinkedIn, no Facebook, nothing. Something about him bugs me, scratching that part of my mind again. But I'll hack him soon enough. I always do.
Back to the scene. Elliot eyes Krista.
KRISTA: I know you're not yelling like before, which is good. But I can tell you're still holding on to it. And we need to work on your anger issues, Elliot. You're angry at everyone, at society--
ELLIOT (V.O.): Fuck society.
KRISTA: I know you have a lot to be angry about, but keeping it to yourself and staying quiet like you're doing it's not going to help you. There's pain underneath. That's where our work needs to go.
Elliot says nothing. Krista leans forward.
KRISTA: What is it about society that disappoints you so much?
Elliot holds back as his eyes wander to the Apple insignia glowing off of Krista‚Äôs laptop on her desk.
ELLIOT (V.O.): Oh, I don't know. Is it that we collectively thought Steve Jobs was a great man, even when we knew he made billions off the backs of children?
His eyes shift to the glass framed Tour De France poster hanging on the wall featuring Lance Armstrong.
ELLIOT (V.O.): Or maybe it‚Äôs that it feels like all our heroes are counterfeit, the world itself just one big hoax.
His eyes refocus on the reflection of the glass frame, seeing that Krista‚Äôs browser from her laptop is on Twitter.
ELLIOT (V.O.): Spamming each other with our running commentary of bullshit masquerading as insight, our social media faking as intimacy.
Krista still eyes Elliot, waiting for him to respond. He returns his stare back at her, noticing the ‚ÄúI voted‚Äù sticker on her blouse.
ELLIOT (V.O.): Or is it that we voted for this? Not with our rigged elections--
His eyes now notice the expensive accessories of Krista. Her earrings, watch, shoes, her Hunger Games book in her bag.
ELLIOT (V.O.): But with our things, our property, our money. I'm not saying anything new. We all know why we do this, not because Hunger Games books makes us happy--
Krista crosses her legs, still waiting on Elliot to respond. That‚Äôs when Elliot spots a prescription bottle next to Krista‚Äôs purse on her desk chair.
ELLIOT (V.O.): But because we wanna be sedated. Because it‚Äôs painful not to pretend, because we‚Äôre cowards. Fuck society.
KRISTA (echoing): Elliot. You‚Äôre not saying anything, what‚Äôs wrong?
He finally responds to Krista.
ELLIOT: Nothing.
Krista collects herself, frustrated she‚Äôs getting nowhere.
ELLIOT: Don‚Äôt be frustrated.
KRISTA (confused): Why shouldn‚Äôt I be?
ELLIOT: You‚Äôre different than most. You at least try. You at least understand.
KRISTA (intrigued): Understand what?
ELLIOT: What it's like to feel alone. You understand the pain. You want to protect people from it. You want to protect me from it. I respect that about you.
Long silence.
KRISTA: Why do you think I know what it's like to feel alone?
ELLIOT (V.O.): Shit! From her emails!
KRISTA: Elliot?
ELLIOT: I don‚Äôt know.
Krista lets it go.
KRISTA: Let's talk about last night. Did you go to Angela's birthday party?
FLASHBACK: Last night, we pick up where we left off. Elliot‚Äôs hand trembles as he reaches for the door to the bar. He sweats as he closes his eyes and tries to force himself to go in, but can‚Äôt. The door opens, three people file out. Elliot quickly moves out of the way, avoiding physical contact at all costs. He takes a breath and looks through the windows again. Angela is happy, surrounded by friends, enjoying her birthday. Ollie walks up to her. They kiss. This is enough for Elliot to wrap his head in his hoodie and walk away--
Back to the scene.
ELLIOT: Yeah. It was nice.
KRISTA: Did you try to talk to anyone?
ELLIOT: Sure. I got a girl‚Äôs number.
KRISTA (impressed): You did?
ELLIOT (chuckles): She‚Äôs cute. She likes the Hunger Games.
KRISTA (back to being suspicious): You're hiding again, Elliot. When you hide, your delusions come back. It's a slippery slope. Let's talk about the men in black you've been seeing. Are they still there?
ELLIOT: No, I told you they're gone. The meds you gave me are working.
INT. ALLSAFE OFFICES - CUBICLE - LATER
Elliot types away at his computer. He glances up and notices Ollie approaching.
OLLIE: Yo man. Do you wanna--
Elliot reluctantly takes off his headphones.
OLLIE: Uh, do you wanna do lunch today?
ELLIOT: Uh yeah, I got other plans--
OLLIE: Other plans. Right. That‚Äôs what you said the last three times I asked you.
Ollie looks around.
OLLIE: Look, bud, you and Angela have been close for a long time, and that's even more reason why I want us to be on good terms. I - I just I feel like things have been awkward between us. Don't you?
ELLIOT: I‚Äôm okay with it being awkward between us.
OLLIE (awkwardly laughs): Um, yeah. I - I - I‚Äôm not okay with that.
OLLIE (more sympathetic tone): Um look, man, I love Angela, and I want us to to get along for her sake. I mean, that's what I'm that's what I'm here for. I just, I - I don't normally do stuff
As Ollie drones on again, Elliot‚Äôs stream of consciousness interrupts:
ELLIOT (V.O.): Am I that crazy not to like this guy? Among some of his Facebook likes are--
INSERT: Ollie‚Äôs Facebook profile and likes.
ELLIOT (V.O.): George W. Bush‚Äôs Decision Points, Transformers 2: Revenge of the Fallen, and the music of Josh Groban. Must I really justify myself any further?
Back to scene.
ELLIOT (V.O.): His was the easiest to hack. Password was 123456Seven.
INSERT: Ollie‚Äôs Gmail account.
ELLIOT (V.O.): I witnessed his first ""I love you"" with Angela over Gchat.
INSERT: Profile pic of a trashy woman named Stella B.
ELLIOT (V.O.): Then I witnessed the first of many infidelities with Stella B.
Back to the scene. Ollie‚Äôs still in the midst of his phony plea.
OLLIE: ...I've never done anything like this before.
ELLIOT (V.O.): I've thought about telling Angela, but she has shitty taste in men, and I'm not quite ready to see what comes after this just yet.
OLLIE: ...You like music. I like music. Maroon 5.
ELLIOT (V.O.): Plus I can manage Ollie easier than the others. For now, anyway.
OLLIE: And that's all I mean. I just want you to know that. I like you, bro, and I want you to like me too.
ELLIOT: I understand. I‚Äôll try harder.
OLLIE: That's cool, man. Hey, whenever you're ready, I'd love to just...chill--
He puts his arm on Elliot‚Äôs shoulder-- but Elliot, not comfortable with the physical contact, shifts his shoulder away.
OLLIE: Oh, forgot about your no touching thing.
ELLIOT (V.O.): Truth is, I shouldn't hate Ollie; he's not that bad a guy. He's too dumb to be bad. In fact, when I think about the really bad people--
As if sensing it, Elliot peeks out of his cubicle. He sees a handful of business SUITS at the front. The SUITS head towards Gideon‚Äôs office.
ELLIOT (V.O.): E Corp, the largest conglomerate in the world. They're so big, they're literally everywhere.
E Corp‚Äôs logo, which looks like the Enron ‚ÄúE‚Äù logo, is shown on all the products inside of the office: desktops, smartphones, laptops.
ELLIOT (V.O.): A perfect monster of modern society. The E might as well stand for Evil.
An advertisement plays on a television and displays some of E Corp‚Äôs ventures. Agriculture, electronics, medicine, construction.
ELLIOT (V.O.): In fact, after a thorough, intensive self-reprogramming, that's all my mind hears, sees, or reads when they pop up in my world.
INSERT: E Corp advertisement.
WOMAN: That's what we have to offer. Together, we can change the world with E Corp--
INSERT: Replace E Corp logo with Evil Corp logo
ELLIOT (V.O.):  Krista would have a shit fit if she knew I did that. But that‚Äôs what they are...a conglomerate of evil. And now I have to help them.
Gideon and the team of SUITS walk up next to Elliot‚Äôs cubicle.
GIDEON: There are six on-site engineers on your account. Plus a few off-site.
Elliot sneaks a peek at the head suit, Steve Ballmer with a full mane of hair.
ELLIOT (V.O.): There he is, Terry Colby, the CTO.
TERRY COLBY looks around with a doofus smile.
ELLIOT (V.O.): Even though he's the head technology guy at one of the biggest companies in the world, he owns a Blackberry.
Elliot‚Äôs eyes shift to Terry‚Äôs Blackberry on his belt. Terry looks at Elliot‚Äôs desktop with confusion.
ELLIOT (V.O.): But also looks like he doesn't see a terminal very often. He's not a techie. He's a moron.
The suits, led by Gideon, keep on walking through the office.
ELLIOT (V.O.): An arrogant moron. The worst kind.
Elliot focuses on his terminal, but a person from the pack walks up to him. He‚Äôs good-looking, sharply dressed and has a rock star smile. His name is TYRELL WELLICK (30s). He reaches his hand out to Elliot. Elliot painfully takes it.
TYRELL (thick Swedish accent): Oh, hi. Tyrell Wellick. I'm Senior Vice President, Technology.
ELLIOT: I‚Äôm...Elliot. Just a tech.
TYRELL: Don't be so humble. You know, I started out exactly where you are, and to be honest, you know, my heart is still there.  So I see you're running Gnome. You know, I'm actually on KDE myself. I know this desktop environment is supposed to be better but you know what they say. Old habits they die hard.
ELLIOT (V.O.): An executive running Linux with--
TYRELL: Yeah, I know what you're thinking. I'm an executive. I mean why am I even running Linux? Again old habits. It's gonna be fun working with you. I should join the rest of the group. Bonsoir, Elliot.
He takes off with an earnest smile.
Elliot sits back down in his cubicle with a resigned sigh. He takes in his small three-walled cube universe amidst the thirty other identical cubes.
ELLIOT (V.O.): Sometimes I dream of saving the world.
His eyes look over at Lloyd who is busy paying a Verizon bill online.
ELLIOT(V.O.): Saving everyone from the invisible hand, one that brands us with an employee badge.
Elliot eyes his fellow employees sympathetically, all looking like enslaved serfs with their company badges hanging off them.
EXT. NYC STREETS - NIGHT
Elliot walks through the streets alone as GROUPS OF FRIENDS laugh while walking in and out of bars. Credit cards are swiped, dollar-tips are thrown, a homeless man begs for change.
ELLIOT (V.O.): The one that forces us to work for them. The one that controls us every day without us knowing it. But I can‚Äôt stop it. I‚Äôm not that special.
INT. ELLIOT‚ÄôS LOFT - NIGHT
Elliot enters his messy small loft.
ELLIOT (V.O.): I'm just anonymous. I'm just alone.
Elliot makes his way over to a fishbowl, swimming inside is a black fish named QWERTY.
ELLIOT (V.O.): If it weren't for Qwerty, I'd be completely empty.
MOMENTS LATER
ELLIOT (V.O.): I hate when I can't hold in my loneliness. This crying has been happening too often, every other week now. What do normal people do when they get this sad? They reach out to friends or family, I think.
INT. ELLIOT‚ÄôS HOUSE (FLASHBACK) - DAY
A YOUNG ELLIOT (8) sits at the kitchen table. His MOTHER (30s), pretty but cold. Buttoned up, a short haircut, and expressionless face. She methodically smokes a cigarette. Young Elliot looks like he‚Äôs been scolded. His mother grabs his arms and slams them down on the table.
ELLIOT (V.O.) : That‚Äôs not an option.
INT. ELLIOT‚ÄôS LOFT - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
Elliot crushes up morphine pills. He puts the crushed powder on a small glass table and cuts it with a credit card.
ELLIOT (V.O.): I do morphine.
INT. ELLIOT‚ÄôS LOFT - MOMENTS LATER
Elliot snorts up a line of morphine. He lies back down on the floor as it takes effect. He sprawls out on his couch, staring at Qwerty as it takes effect.
ELLIOT (V.O.): The key to doing morphine without turning into a junkie is to limit yourself to 30 milligrams a day. Anything more just builds up your tolerance. I check every pill I get for purity. I have 8 milligram Suboxone for maintenance in case I go through withdrawals--
Elliot‚Äôs eyes shift from Qwerty to an empty prescription bottle.
ELLIOT (V.O.): Shit! I‚Äôm out again.
He reaches out for it in disbelief.
MOMENTS LATER
SHAYLA (20s), a hipster girl, steps into the room. She slides an orange bottle full of pills.
ELLIOT: How much?
SHAYLA: On the house.
ELLIOT: No Shayla, not doing that. Okay? This is just a regular drug deal, like it always is.
Elliot offers her cash. Shayla resigns herself and takes it.
SHAYLA: So what are you you to tonight? 'Cause I tried to post something on your Facebook and couldn't find you.
ELLIOT: I‚Äôm not on Facebook.
SHAYLA: What? Why not?
ELLIOT: ‚ÄòCause I hate Facebook.
SHAYLA (offended): That‚Äôs crazy.
Elliot shoots her a look, ‚ÄúI guess I‚Äôm crazy.‚Äù Disappointed, Shayla playfully pulls out two white pills from her pocket.
SHAYLA: Well you want to do these together then? Pure Molly.
The last line piques Elliot‚Äôs interest, though his look is already regretting the decision.
INT. ELLIOT‚ÄôS LOFT - LATER
Elliot lies naked in his bed, smoking a joint, while a nude Shayla lies next to him, fast asleep. He wears a dumb look.
ELLIOT (V.O.): Don't ever make decisions when you're on morphine.
His cell beeps. He looks at it.
ELLIOT (V.O.): Instagram check-in for Krista at Pierre Loti. Okay, Michael Hansen. Time to find out who you really are.
EXT. PIERRE LOTI - NIGHT
Elliot, in a hoodie, walks by Pierre Loti across the street. He doesn‚Äôt walk towards it, instead he stays put, lurking around the corner.
Elliot looks around the city block he‚Äôs standing on. In the distance, a late night diner shows two MEN IN BLACK having coffee. Elliot hides in the shadows, watching them.
EXT. PIERRE LOTI - AWHILE LATER
Elliot‚Äôs spies Michael from across the street as he watches him kiss Krista goodbye. They part ways.
Michael hails a cab. Elliot snaps a picture of the number on top of Michael‚Äôs cab as it takes off. He quickly pulls out his cell phone and dials.
ELLIOT (into the phone): Uh, hi I just left my keys in one of your cabs. 56Y2. Sure.
Suddenly, the MR. ROBOT bum from the subway walks up to their table, begging for money. Elliot shoots a confused look-- but gets interrupted when the operator returns.
ELLIOT: 306 Hawthorne. Thank you. Thank you.
He hangs up and returns his gaze back to the two MEN IN BLACK. Mr. Robot is nowhere to be seen. He lets it go for now and returns to the task at hand.
EXT. 306 HAWTHORNE AVENUE - LATER
Elliot walks up and sees the cab, waiting by the curb. On the stoop in front of 306 Hawthorne, Michael begrudgingly walks his dog. It‚Äôs as if Michael has completely dropped his cheery, nice guy act.
MICHAEL: Come on, asshole, piss already! Come on!
He jerks the dog by his leash, causing him to YELP.
Elliot charges from across the street.
The cowed dog looks up sheepishly at Michael as it nervously paces around the small patch of grass.
MICHAEL: Come on! Will you will you go? - Come on, go, go!
He yanks the dog into the air by the leash, when Elliot finally gets there--
ELLIOT: Hey!
MICHAEL: Go, will ya?
The dog yelps again.
ELLIOT: Hey!
Michael stops and turns. Elliot looks at the dog with sympathy, but then back at Michael.
ELLIOT: May I borrow your phone? Mine's dead. I need to call my mom.
Michael reluctantly nods and pulls out his cell. He slides it unlocked with his passcode and hands it to him.
ELLIOT: Thank you.
Elliot takes it, immediately memorizing all the apps on his homescreen, specifically the E Corp app.
He dials his own number and calls. From within Elliot‚Äôs back pocket, we see his phone light up and vibrate.
Elliot gets his own voicemail. He hangs up, quickly deletes his call log and looks back at Michael.
ELLIOT: No answer. Thanks anyway.
Michael takes his phone back with a shrug.
EXT. NYC SUBWAY - LATER
Elliot walks out of the subway station, smoking a joint. His phone immediately vibrates. He looks at it with a question, then answers.
ELLIOT: Angela, is everything okay?
INTERCUT WITH:
INT. ALLSAFE OFFICES - CUBICLE
Angela stands apart from Lloyd, who is desperately trying to tackle a tech issue on his desktop.
ANGELA (into the phone, discreet): I need you to come to AllSafe.
ELLIOT: You're there? It's three in the morning.
ANGELA: They attacked Evil Corp servers again, but it's bad this time. It's a DDoS attack.
ELLIOT: Did you call Lloyd? He's on call.
ANGELA: Yeah, he's here.
ELLIOT: Is he talking to their tech department?
ANGELA: He's online with them, but so far nothing. I don't think that Lloyd can handle this. Look, Gideon just put me on this account. I can't screw up in my first week. I need you. Please.
Elliot looks back into the subway. He tosses his joint.
INT. ALLSAFE OFFICES - NIGHT
Elliot races in. Angela walks up to him, panicking.
ANGELA: Finally!
ELLIOT: Calm down, it‚Äôs only been an hour.
ANGELA: Yeah, well, an hour in Evil Corp time is like $13 million in revenue, approximately. Actually, I calculated that. That's exactly how much they lost.
ELLIOT: Don‚Äôt worry, I got you.
They approach Lloyd who is sweating bullets in his cubicle.
ELLIOT: Lloyd, what‚Äôs up?
No response, Lloyd is locked in on his terminal.
LLOYD: Elliot. This is bad. Worst DDoS attack I've ever seen.
ELLIOT: Did you reconfigure the DNS?
LLOYD: Yes!
ELLIOT: Stop the services.
LLOYD: I already stopped the services, tries to reboot the servers but they're not coming back up. Dude, someone is straight up fingerblasting their entire network right now.
Elliot types furiously on his desktop, navigating Evil Corp‚Äôs
servers.
Angela checks her phone.
ANGELA: They just started reporting on the outage.
ELLIOT (V.O.): Shit. This is worse than I thought. They‚Äôre in the network.
Elliot types away as Gideon walks in. Even though he‚Äôs angry, he keeps his cool. He sees Elliot, then faces Angela.
GIDEON: What's the status update? See here. I thought we set up security protocols - so that this doesn't happen. Where‚Äôs the attack coming from?
ELLIOT: Everywhere, obviously. - The USA, Finland, Thailand, Kuwait--
GIDEON: Start restarting the services, load sharing, redirect the traffic--and call Prolexic for help.
ELLIOT: Wait.
GIDEON: What?
ELLIOT: I don't think this is just a DDoS attack. I think they got a rootkit sitting inside the servers.
ANGELA: What‚Äôs a rootkit?
LLOYD: It's like a crazy serial rapist with a very big dick.
ANGELA: Jesus, Lloyd!
LLOYD: Sorry. It's malicious code that completely takes over their system. It can delete system files and stop programs. Viruses, worms--
ANGELA: How do we stop it?
LLOYD: That's the thing. It's fundamentally invisible you can't stop it. All of their servers are timing out. None of them are coming back up.
Elliot moves to Lloyd‚Äôs terminal to check something.
ELLIOT: That's because every time we restart the server the virus replicates itself during boot up and crashes the host.
LLOYD: How are we supposed to bring up the network if we can't restart the servers?
ELLIOT: We can't. Which is what they wanted. By defending ourselves, we ended up spreading the virus everywhere.
Everyone exchanges tense looks. Gideon tries to contain himself as he already knows what follows.
ELLIOT: Only thing we can do is we've gotta take the whole system offline, wipe the infected servers clean, then bring them back up.
GIDEON: You‚Äôre coming with me.
ELLIOT (whispers): Yeah.
GIDEON: Lloyd. Tell everybody to start taking everything offline.
LLOYD: Got it.
GIDEON (on the phone): Uh, the server farm in Dulles. We're gonna need the jet.
EXT. PRIVATE JET - NIGHT
Gideon and Elliot speed walk towards a slick black sedan already waiting for them.
INT. SERVER FARM - NIGHT
Elliot speed-walks into the loud WHIRRING of the large arrays of servers.
GIDEON: They're booting the network back up. Now, you're downloading the logs, right because--
ELLIOT: Stop. Tell him to stop.
GIDEON: What?
ELLIOT: Don't start the boot sequence. You guys missed one. There's an infected server up and running.
Elliot moves to the server display and points out  cs 30.
ELLIOT: What's the ETA before it hits this server? (Elliot)The backup server up and running?
A spectating TECH nervously stares at the display and then Elliot before shrugging.
Elliot returns to the console and starts to furiously type.
ELLIOT: The backup server up and running?
TECH: It's ready, but it's not configured for auto switch.
Elliot races towards the backup server, cs51. He finds it terminals in.
ELLIOT: We need to redirect the traffic, need to switch DNS.
The displays shows that the network is slowly coming back online, approaching the still-inf",en,LABEL_0,0.5422829389572144,LABEL_1,0.45771709084510803

- -Good luck.

Hi. Uh, I have an appointment with Emily Charlton?
-Andrea Sachs? -Yes.
Great. Human Resources certainly has an odd sense of humor.
Follow me.
Okay, so I was Miranda's second assistant‚Ä¶
but her first assistant recently got promoted, and so now I'm the first.
-Oh, and you're replacing yourself. -Well, I am trying.
Miranda sacked the last two girls after only a few weeks.
We need to find someone who can survive here. Do you understand?
Yeah. Of course. Who's Miranda?
Oh, my God. I will pretend you did not just ask me that.
She's the editor in chief of Runway, not to mention a legend.
You work a year for her, and you can get a job at any magazine you want.
A million girls would kill for this job.
It sounds like a great opportunity. I'd love to be considered.

Andrea, Runway is a fashion magazine‚Ä¶
so an interest in fashion is crucial.
What makes you think I'm not interested in fashion?
- -Oh, my God.
No! No! No!
What's wrong?
She's on her way. Tell everyone!
She's not supposed to be here until 9:00.
Her driver just text messaged, and her facialist ruptured a disk.
-God, these people! - Who's that?
That I can't even talk about.
All right, everyone! Gird your loins!
- -Did somebody eat an onion bagel?


Sorry, Miranda.

Move it! Ooh!
I don't understand why it's so difficult to confirm an appointment.
I know. I'm so sorry, Miranda. I actually did confirm last night.
Details of your incompetence do not interest me.
Tell Simone I'm not going to approve that girl that she sent me for the Brazilian layout.
I asked for clean, athletic, smiling. She sent me dirty, tired and paunchy.
And R.S.V.P. Yes to the Michael Kors party.
I want the driver to drop me off at 9:30 and pick me up at 9:45 sharp.
- 9:45 sharp. -Call Natalie at Glorious Foods, tell her no for the 40th time.
No, I don't want dacquoise. I want tortes filled with warm rhubarb compote.
Then call my ex-husband and remind him the parent-teacher conference is at Dalton tonight.
Then call my husband, ask him to meet me for dinner at that place I went to with Massimo.
Tell Richard I saw the pictures that he sent for that feature on the female paratroopers‚Ä¶
and they're all so deeply unattractive.
Is it impossible to find a lovely, slender female paratrooper?
-No. -Am I reaching for the stars here? Not really.
Also, I need to see all the things that Nigel has pulled for Gwyneth's second cover try.
I wonder if she's lost any of that weight yet. Who's that?
Nobody. Um, uh‚Ä¶
Human Resources sent her up about the new assistant job, and I was preinterviewing her.
But she's hopeless and totally wrong for it.
Clearly I'm going to have to do that myself because the last two you sent me‚Ä¶
were completely inadequate.
So send her in. That's all.
Right.
-She wants to see you. -Oh! She does?
Move!
-This is foul. Don't let her see it. Go! -That's‚Ä¶

Who are you?
Uh, my name is Andy Sachs.
I recently graduated from Northwestern University.
And what are you doing here?
Well, I think I could do a good job as your assistant.
And, um‚Ä¶
Yeah, I came to New York to be a journalist and sent letters out everywhere‚Ä¶
and then finally got a call from Elias-Clarke‚Ä¶
and met with Sherry up at Human Resources.
Basically, it's this or Auto Universe.
-So you don't read Runway? -Uh, no.
And before today, you had never heard of me.
No.
And you have no style or sense of fashion.
Well, um, I think that depends on what you're‚Ä¶
No, no. That wasrt a question.
Um, I was editor in chief of the Daily Northwestern.
I also, um, won a national competition for college journalists‚Ä¶
with my series on thejanitors'union, which exposed the exploitation‚Ä¶
That's all.

Yeah. You know, okay.
You're right. I don't fit in here.
I am not skinny or glamorous‚Ä¶
and I don't know that much about fashion.
But I'm smart.
I learn fast and I will work very hard.
I got the exclusive on the Cavalli for Gwyneth‚Ä¶
but the problem is, with that huge feathered headdress that she's wearing‚Ä¶
she looks like she's working the main stage at the Golden Nugget.
Thank you for your time.
Who is that sad little person?
Are we doing a before-and-after piece I don't know about?
Brown and Law, please?Thank you.
-Andrea. -Hmm?
Wait. You got a job at a fashion magazine?
-Mm-hmm. -What was it, a phone interview?
- wow. -Ow! Don't be a jerk.
Miranda Priestly is famous for being unpredictable.
Okay, Doug. How is it that you know who she is and I didn't?
-I'm actually a girl. -Oh!
-That would explain so much. - Look, seriously.
Miranda Priestly is a huge deal. I bet a million girls would kill for that job.
Yeah, great. The thing is I'm not one of them.
 Look, you gotta start somewhere, right?
I mean, look at this dump Nate works in.
I mean, come on. Paper napkins? Hello.
Yeah. And Lily, she works at that gallery doing, uh, you know‚Ä¶
Oh, I'm sorry. What exactly is it that you do anyway?
Well, lucky for me, I already have my dream job.
 You're a corporate research analyst!
-Oh, you're right. My job sucks. -No!
-It sucks. I don't‚Ä¶ It's boring. -It's all right. Breathe.
-I'm trying. -Here. Take a drink.
-I will have a drink. I will have a drink. -Ah, yes.
-I'd like to propose a toast. To jobs that pay the rent. -To jobs that pay the rent.
 Jobs that pay the rent.
Oh, baby. You should see the way these girls at Runway dress.
I don't have a thing to wear to work.
Come on. You're gonna be answering phones and getting coffee.
You need a ball gown for that?
I think I might.
Well, I happen to think you look great always.
Aww! I think you're full of it.

-Hey. Come on. Let's go home. -Yeah.
I can think of something we can do that doesn't require any clothing.
-Really? -Mmm.
- -
Hello?
Andrea, Miranda decided to kill the autumn jacket story for September‚Ä¶
and she is pulling up the Sedona shoot from October.
You need to come into the office right this second and pick up her coffee order on the way.
-Now? -Now, get a pen and write this down.
-Now? -Now, get a pen and write this down.
I want one no-foam skimmed latte with an extra shot‚Ä¶
and three drip coffees with room for milk.
-Searing hot. And I mean hot. -
- -
Hello?
- Where are you? -Oh, I'm almost there. Yeah.
Shoot! Oh!

Is there some reason that my coffee isn't here?
Has she died or something?
No.  God.
Oh. Bloody time.
-I hope you know that this is a very difficult job‚Ä¶ -Mm-hmm.
For which you are totally wrong.
And if you mess up, my head is on the chopping block.
Now, hang that up. Don't just fling it anywhere.
Okay. First of all, you and I answer the phones.
The phone must be answered every single time it rings.
Calls roll to voice mail, and she gets very upset.
If I'm not here‚Ä¶ Andrea, Andrea‚Ä¶
you are chained to that desk.
-Well, what if I need to‚Ä¶ -What? No.
One time an assistant left the desk because she sliced her hand open with a letter opener‚Ä¶
and Miranda missed Lagerfeld‚Ä¶
just before he boarded a 17-hour flight to Australia.
She now works at TVGuide.
-Man the desk at all times. Got it. -
-Uh‚Ä¶ -Miranda Priestly's office.
No, she's not available.
-Who is it? -
Yes, I will tell her you called‚Ä¶ yet again.
- -Right. Remember, you and I have totally differentjobs.
I mean, you get coffee‚Ä¶  and you run errands.
Yet I am in charge of her schedule‚Ä¶
her appointments and her expenses.
And, um, most importantly, um‚Ä¶
I get to go with her to Paris for Fashion Week in the fall.
I get to wear couture. I go to all the shows and all the parties.
I meet all of the designers. It's divine.
Okay. Now, stay here. I'm going to the art department to give them the Book.
-The‚Ä¶ -This is the Book.
Now, it is a mock-up of everything‚Ä¶
in the current issue.
And we deliver it to Miranda's apartment every night, and she retu‚Ä¶
Don't touch it. She returns it to us in the morning with her notes.
Now, the second assistant is supposed to do this‚Ä¶
but Miranda is very private and she does not like strangers in her house.
So until she decides that you are not a total psycho‚Ä¶
I get the lovely task of waiting around for the Book.
- -Oh, Emily? What do I do‚Ä¶
-Deal with it. -


Hello. Mrs. Priestly's office.
Hmm. That's what I meant. Miranda Priestly's office.

Um, you know, she is in a meeting. Can I please take a message?
Uh-huh.
Okay. Can you please spell Gabbana?
- -Hello?
I guess not.
I guessed an eight and a half.
Um, uh, that's very nice of you‚Ä¶
but I don't think I need these.
Miranda hired me. She knows what I look like.
-Do you? -
Emily.
Emily?
She means you.
-Wejust cut on the bias. - That's not what I asked you.
I couldn't have been clearer. There you are, Emily.
-How many times do I have to scream your name? -Actually, it's Andy.
My name is Andy. Andrea, but, uh, everybody calls me Andy.
 I need 10 or 15 skirts from Calvin Klein.
-What kind of skirts do you‚Ä¶ -Please bore someone else with your questions.
And make sure we have Pier 59 at 8:00 a.m. Tomorrow.
Remind Jocelyn I need to see a few of those satchels that Marc is doing in the pony.
And then tell Simone I'll takeJackie if Maggie isn't available.
-Did Demarchelier confirm? -D-Did D-Demarchel‚Ä¶
Demarchelier. Did he‚Ä¶ Get him on the phone.
Uh, o‚Ä¶ okay.
-And, Emily? -Yes?
That's all.
It's just the cavalier disregard for clear directions‚Ä¶

Do you have Demarchelier?
Uh, Demarchelier.
- Leave it. -Do you have‚Ä¶
I have Miranda Priestly calling.
I have Patrick!
Uh, no, she called me in there and-and then she asked me about Pier 59.
And there was something about Simone, Frankie, someone else.
And, um, she needs skirts from Calvin Klein.
And, uh, there was something about a pony.
-Did she say which skirts? -No. No.
-Did she say what kind? Color, shape, fabric? -I tried to ask her.
You may never ask Miranda anything.
Right. I will deal with all of this, and you will go to Calvin Klein.
Eh‚Ä¶ Me?
Oh, I'm sorry. Do you have some prior commitment?
Some hideous skirt convention you have to go to?
Uh‚Ä¶
- -Miranda?
-Are you there? -I'm about to walk in. I'll call you as soon as‚Ä¶

- -
-Hello? Hi. - While you're out‚Ä¶
Miranda needs you to go to Hermes to pick up 25 scarves we ordered for her.
-Okay. -Cassidy forgot her homework at Dalton. Pick that up.
Miranda went out to meet with Meisel, and she will want more Starbucks when she gets back.
-Hot Starbucks. -Can you just repeat that first‚Ä¶
- -Hello?
Oh, my God.
What took you so long?I have to pee!
What?You haven't peed since I left?
No, I haven't. I've been manning the desk, haven't I? I'm bursting.
Oh, hi.
- -You do coat. Do the coat!
Okay.
Now, be prepared. The run-through is at 12:30.
People are panicking, so the phone is going to be ringing off the hook.
The ru‚Ä¶ The run-through. Right.
Yes. Editors bring in options for the shoot, and Miranda chooses.
She chooses every single thing in every single issue.
Run-throughs are a huge deal. I don't know why you don't know that, Andrea.
- Okay. Are you ready? - Oh, hi, hi.
Right. Well, after the loo, Serena and I are going to lunch.
-This is her‚Ä¶ the new me. -Hi.
-Told you. -I thought you were kidding.
No, quite serious, yeah. I get 20 minutes for lunch, and you get 15.
-When I come back, you can go. -Okay.
 What exactly is she wearing?
 Her grandmother's skirt.

Hmm. Corn chowder.
That's an interesting choice.
You do know that cellulite is one of the main ingredients in corn chowder.

So none of the girls here eat anything?
Not since two became the new four and zero became the new two.
-Well, I'm a six. -Which is the new 14.
Oh. Shoot.
Oh, never mind. I'm sure you have plenty more polyblend where that came from.
- -Okay. You think my clothes are hideous.
I get it.
But, you know, I'm not going to be in fashion forever‚Ä¶
so I don't see the point of changing everything about myself just because I have this job.
Yes, that's true.
That's really what this multibillion-dollar industry is all about anyway, isn't it?
-Inner beauty. -
Hello.
Right. Come on.
-Miranda's pushed the run-through up a half an hour. -Mmm!
-She's always 15 minutes early. -Which means?
-You're already late. Come. -Shoot!
Excuse me.
- -Mr. Ravitz.
Nigel.
-Issue going well? -Oh, yes. Our best September ever.
Great. Heard Miranda killed autumn jackets and pulled up the Sedona shoot.
What's that costing me?
About 300,000.
Must have been some lousy jackets.
-Irv Ravitz. -Oh, I'm sorry.
This is Andy Sachs, Miranda's new assistant.
Congratulations, young lady.
A million girls would kill for that job.
Bye-bye.
-Hmm? -Chairman of Elias-Clarke, Irv Ravitz.
You know what they say?Tiny man, huge ego.
No. And I've seen all this before.
Theyskens is trying to reinvent the drop waist, so actually it's‚Ä¶
-Where are all the other dresses? -We have some right here.
-Stand, watch and listen. -And I think it can be very interesting‚Ä¶
No. No, I just‚Ä¶ It's just baffling to me.
Why is it so impossible to put together a decent run-through?
You people have had hours and hours to prepare. It's just so confusing to me.
Where are the advertisers?
-We have some pieces from Banana Republic. -We need more, don't we?
-Oh. This is‚Ä¶ This might be‚Ä¶ What do you think of‚Ä¶ -Yeah.
Well, you know me.
Give me a full ballerina skirt and a hint of saloon and I'm on board.
-But do you think it's too much like‚Ä¶ -Like the Lacroix from July?
I thought that, but no, not with the right accessories. It should work.
Where are the belts for this dre‚Ä¶ Why is no one ready?
Here. It's a tough call.
-They're so different. - Hmm.

Something funny?
No. No, no. Nothing's‚Ä¶
You know, it's just that both those belts look exactly the same to me.
You know, I'm still learning about this stuff and, uh‚Ä¶
""This‚Ä¶ stuff""?
Oh. Okay. I see.
You think this has nothing to do with you.
You go to your closet‚Ä¶
and you select‚Ä¶ I don't know‚Ä¶ that lumpy blue sweater, for instance‚Ä¶
because you're trying to tell the world that you take yourself too seriously‚Ä¶
to care about what you put on your back.
But what you don't know is that that sweater is not just blue.
It's not turquoise. It's not lapis.
It's actually cerulean.
And you're also blithely unaware of the fact‚Ä¶
that in 2002, Oscar de la Renta did a collection of cerulean gowns.
And then I think it was Yves Saint Laurent‚Ä¶ wasrt it‚Ä¶
who showed cerulean military jackets?
-I think we need a jacket here. -Mmm.
And then cerulean quickly showed up in the collections of eight different designers.
And then it, uh, filtered down through the department stores‚Ä¶
and then trickled on down into some tragic Casual Corner‚Ä¶
and then trickled on down into some tragic Casual Corner‚Ä¶
where you, no doubt, fished it out of some clearance bin.
However, that blue represents millions of dollars‚Ä¶
and countless jobs‚Ä¶
and it's sort of comical how you think that you've made a choice‚Ä¶
that exempts you from the fashion industry‚Ä¶
when, in fact‚Ä¶
you're wearing a sweater that was selected for you by the people in this room‚Ä¶
from a pile of stuff.
So then I said, ""No, I couldn't see the difference‚Ä¶
between the two absolutely identical belts'""‚Ä¶
and you should have seen the look she gave me!
I thought the flesh was gonna melt off her face.
- -It's not funny.
She's not happy unless everyone around her is panicked, nauseous or suicidal.
And the Clackers just worship her.
-The who? -They call them Clackers.
The sound that their stilettos make in the marble lobby.
It's like, ""Clack, clack, clack. Clack, clack.""
 And they all act like they're curing cancer or something.
 The amount of time and energy‚Ä¶
that these people spend on these insignificant, minute details, and for what?
So that tomorrow they can spend another $300,000 reshooting something‚Ä¶
that was probably fine to begin with‚Ä¶
to sell people things they don't need!
God!
-I'm not even hungry anymore. -What?
-That is why those girls are so skinny. -Oh. No, no, no.
Give me that. There's, like, eight dollars ofJarlsberg in there.
 You know what?
I just have to stick it out for a year. One year.
And then I can do what I came to New York to do.
But I can't let Miranda get to me. I won't.
Easy there, tiger.
-Oh, good morning, Miranda. -Get me Isaac.
I don't see my breakfast here. Are my eggs here? Where are my eggs?
Excuse me!
Pick up the Polaroids from the lingerie shoot.
Have the brakes checked on my car.
- -
Where's that piece of paper I had in my hand yesterday morning?
The girls need new surfboards or boogie boards or something for spring break.
-Hello. -The twins also need flip-flops.
-Ow! -Oh, my gosh!
Pick up my shoes from Blahnik, and then go get Patricia.
-Who's that? -Good girl! Good girl! Good girl!
Get me that little table that I liked at that store on Madison.
Get us a reservation for dinner tonight at that place that got the good review.
-Get me Isaac. -Thirty-six thank-you notes delivered today.
-Where is everyone? -Why is no one working?

Get me Demarchelier.
I have Miranda Priestly calling for‚Ä¶ Okay.
I have Patrick.
 Thank God it's Friday, right?
At least Miranda will be in Miami, so we don't have to be on call this weekend.
You know, my dad's coming in from Ohio.
Yeah, we're gonna go out to dinner, maybe see Chicago.
You doing anything fun this weekend?
Yes.

 Yeah, Nate said it was great.
He actually‚Ä¶ He applied here, but they wanted someone with more experience.
-Here. -Huh? What's this?
I don't want you to get behind on your rent.
-Dad, how did you‚Ä¶ -It's‚Ä¶
I'm gonna kill Mom. 
Dad, thank you.
Mm-hmm.
-It's really good to see you. -You too, honey.
So, you want to start grilling me now‚Ä¶
or should we wait till after dinner?
I thought I'd let you at least enjoy the bread basket first.
No, no, no. It's okay. Go right ahead.
We're just a little worried, honey.
We get e-mails from you at your office at 2:00 a.m.
Your pay is terrible. You don't get to write anything.
Hey, that's not fair.
I wrote those e-mails.
I'm just trying to understand why someone who got accepted to Stanford Law‚Ä¶
turns it down to be a journalist, and now you're not even doing that.
Dad, you have to trust me.
Being Miranda's assistant opens a lot of doors.
Emily is going to Paris with Miranda in a few months‚Ä¶
and she's gonna meet editors and writers from every important magazine.
And in a year, that could be me.
-All right? -Mm-hmm.
Dad, I swear, this is my break.
-This is my‚Ä¶ my chance. -
This is my boss.
-I'm sorry, Dad. I have to take this. -Take it. Take it.
-Hello. Miranda? -My flight has been canceled.
It's some absurd weather problem.
I need to get home tonight. The twins have a recital tomorrow morning at school.
-What? -At school!
-Absolutely. Let me see what I can do. -Good.
Hi. Um, I know this is totally last minute‚Ä¶
but I was hoping that you could maybe get a flight for my boss‚Ä¶
from Miami to New York tonight?
Uh‚Ä¶
- It's right here. Thank you. - Yeah, any kind ofjet.
-From Miami to New York. -Thank you.
-Yup, I need it tonight. I need it‚Ä¶ -Ow!
-I thought you were going out the other‚Ä¶ -Sweetie! No.
-It's over here, honey. -Tonight.
Hi. I'm trying to get a flight tonight‚Ä¶ for tonight‚Ä¶ from Miami to New York.
Yes, I know there's a hurricane.
Nothing is flying out?What do you mean, nothing is flying out?
It's for Miranda Priestly, and I know that she's a client of yours.
Yes. Yes, hi. I need a jet tonight from Miami to New York.
Yeah. Sorry. Hold on. Hello? Miranda, hi.
I'm trying to get you a flight, but no one is flying out because of the weather.
Please. It's just‚Ä¶ I don't know‚Ä¶ drizzling.
- -Someone must be getting out.
Call Donatella. Get her jet.
Call everybody else that we know that has a jet. Irv?
Call every‚Ä¶ This is your responsibi‚Ä¶ This is yourjob.
Get me home.
Oh, my God! She's going to murder me.
What does she want you to do, call the National Guard and have her airlifted out of there?
Of course not. Could I do that?
Come on.
Come on.
The girls' recital was absolutely wonderful.
They played Rachmaninoff. Everyone loved it.
Everyone except me‚Ä¶
because, sadly, I was not there.
Miranda, I'm so sorry.
Do you know why I hired you?
I always hire the same girl‚Ä¶
stylish, slender, of course‚Ä¶
worships the magazine.
But so often, they turn out to be‚Ä¶
I don't know‚Ä¶ disappointing and, um‚Ä¶
stupid.
So you, with that impressive resume‚Ä¶
and the big speech about your so-called work ethic‚Ä¶
I, um‚Ä¶ I thought you would be different.
I said to myself, go ahead.
Take a chance.
Hire the smart, fat girl.
 I had hope.
My God. I live on it.
Anyway, you ended up disappointing me more than, um‚Ä¶
more than any of the other silly girls.
Um, I really did everything I could think of.
-Uh‚Ä¶ -That's all.
Excuse me! Where do you think you're going?
She hates me, Nigel.
And that's my problem because‚Ä¶
Oh, wait. No, it's not my problem.
I don't know what else I can do because if I do something right, it's unacknowledged.
She doesn't even say thank you.
But if I do something wrong, she is vicious.
-So quit. -What?
-Quit. -Quit?
I can get another girl to take your job in five minutes‚Ä¶ one who really wants it.
No, I don't want to quit. That's not fair.
But, you know, I'm just saying that I would just like a little credit‚Ä¶
for the fact that I'm killing myself trying.
Andy, be serious.
You are not trying.
-You are whining. -L‚Ä¶
What is it that you want me to say to you, huh?
Do you want me to say, "" Poor you. Miranda's picking on you. Poor you. Poor Andy""?
Hmm? Wake up, six.
She's just doing herjob.
Don't you know that you are working at the place‚Ä¶
that published some of the greatest artists of the century?
Halston, Lagerfeld, de la Renta.
And what they did, what they created‚Ä¶
was greater than art because you live your life in it.
Well, not you, obviously, but some people.
You think this is just a magazine, hmm?
This is not just a magazine.
This is a shining beacon of hope for‚Ä¶
oh, I don't know‚Ä¶
let's say a young boy growing up in Rhode Island with six brothers‚Ä¶
pretending to go to soccer practice when he was really going to sewing class‚Ä¶
and reading Runway under the covers at night with a flashlight.
You have no idea how many legends have walked these halls.
And what's worse, you don't care.
Because this place, where so many people would die to work‚Ä¶
you only deign to work.
And you want to know why she doesn't kiss you on the forehead‚Ä¶
and give you a gold star on your homework at the end of the day.
Wake up, sweetheart.

-Okay. So I'm screwing it up. -Mmm.
I don't want to.
I just wish that I knew what I could do to‚Ä¶
- Nigel? -Hmm?
Nigel, Nigel.
No.
I don't know what you expect me to do.
There's nothing in this whole closet that'll fit a size six.
I can guarantee you.
These are all sample sizes‚Ä¶ two and four.
-All right. We're doing this for you. And‚Ä¶ -A poncho?
You'll take what I give you and you'll like it.
-We're doing this Dolce for you. -Hmm!
And shoes.
-Jimmy Choo's. -Hmm.
-Manolo Blahnik. -Wow.
Nancy Gonzalez. Love that.
Okay, Narciso Rodriguez. This we love.
-Uh, it might fit. It might. -What?
Okay. Now, Chanel. You're in desperate need of Chanel. Darling, shall we?
We have to get to the beauty department, and God knows how long that's going to take.

I mean, I have no idea why Miranda hired her.
Me neither. The other day, we were in the beauty department.
She held up the Shu Uemura eyelash curler and said, ""What is this?""

I just knew from the moment I saw her‚Ä¶
she was going to be a complete and utter disas‚Ä¶
- -Miranda Priestly's office.
No, actually, she's not available, but I'll leave word.
Okay, thanks. Bye. 
How did‚Ä¶ 
-Are you wearing the‚Ä¶ -The Chanel boots?
Yeah, I am.
You look good.
-Oh, God. -What?
-She does. -Oh, shut up, Serena.
-See you guys tomorrow. -Good night, man. Take it easy.
Take care of that finger, huh?
So, what do you think?
Uh, I think we better get out of here‚Ä¶
before my girlfriend sees me.

- -


- -The gowns are fabulous.
Mm-hmm. We're gonna use the burgundy.
-Gotta find‚Ä¶ -
So we spent a whole semester on potatoes alone.
You take the fry and squeeze it.
-See how firm that is? -Hey. Oh, I'm so sorry I'm late.
There was a crisis in the accessories department.
-I needed to find a python headband. -Pythors hot right now.
I have exciting presents for all of you.
Are you ready?
-What is that? -It's a Bang & Olufsen phone.
Charlie Rose sent it to Miranda for her birthday.
I looked it up on line. It's $1,100.
-What? -Wow!
And I have some products. Mason Pearson hairbrushes.
-A little Clinique. -Ooh!
-Oh, damn it. I love your job. -Oh! One more.
-A little thing. -
-Do you want it? You want‚Ä¶ Oh. -Gimme! Gimme, gimme, gimme!
-I think she likes it. -Oh, my God! This is the new MarcJacobs!
This is sold out everywhere. Where did you get this?
Miranda didn't want it, so‚Ä¶
No, no, no, no, no. This bag is, like, $1,900. I cannot take this from you.
- -Yeah, you can.
-Why do women need so many bags? -Shut up.
You have one. You put all your junk in it, and that's it. You're done.
Fashion is not about utility.
An accessory is merely a piece of iconography‚Ä¶
used to express individual identity.
-Oh! And it's pretty. -That too.
Yeah. But the thing is, it turns out there is more to Runway than just fancy purses.
Look, here's an essay byJay Mclnerney, a piece byJoan Didion.
Even an interview with Christiane Amanpour.
-Looks like someone's been drinking the Kool-Aid. -What do you‚Ä¶
- -I got it. It's‚Ä¶ Yup, the Dragon Lady.
-Oh, Miranda? -Let me talk to her.
-I need that. -I'll tell her to get her own scrambled eggs.
Lily, no, no, no! Put that thing up! I was gonna answer it!
It's gonna make‚Ä¶ Give me the‚Ä¶ phone.

- -Hi, Miranda.
-Ooh. Shh. -Absolutely.
-Shh! -Uh-huh. I'm leaving right now.
You know, you guys didn't have to be such assholes.



Um, excuse me.
I'm looking forJames Holt.
Um, that's him right there.
-Oh. Thanks. -No problem.
-I put my stuff out there, and I pray they improve. -Really?
-Excuse me. -Hi.
I'm Andy. I'm picking up for Miranda Priestly.
Oh, yes. You must be the new Emily.
- -Nice to meet you.
-Oh, let me see that bag. Very, very nice. -Ah.
Distressed, studded leather, pieced by hand, finished with a metallic fringe.
 Very nice, indeed. Who made that fantastic thing?
You.
Hmm. Duh. This way.
Uh, here we go.
It's a sketch of Miranda's dress for the benefit.
Also the centerpiece of my spring collection. Top secret stuff.
-I'll guard it with my life. -Please do.
Come on. You're working for Miranda Priestly now.
You must be in desperate need of hard liquor.
Excuse us, girls.
She'll have the punch.

It's deadly. Have fun.

-He's right, you know. -Hmm?
The punch. I drank it atJames's last party.
I woke up in Hoboken wearing nothing but a poncho and a cowboy hat.
- -Ah. Well.
-Wise. -
-Uh, hi. -Christian Thompson.
Christian Thompson?You're kidding.
No, you're‚Ä¶ You write for, like, every magazine I love.
I actually‚Ä¶ I reviewed your collection of essays for my college newspaper.
Did you mention my good looks and my killer charm?
-No, but‚Ä¶ -What do you do?
Oh. Well, I want to work for somewhere like The New Yorker or Vanity Fair.
-I am a writer too. -Is that right?
-Mm-hmm. -I should read your stuff. Why don't you send it over?
Yeah?
That would be‚Ä¶ Thank you. That would be great. 
But actually, right now, I'm working as Miranda Priestly's assistant.
Oh, you're kidding. Well, that's too bad.
That's‚Ä¶ Whoa. You'll never survive Miranda.
-Excuse me? -Well, you seem nice, smart.
You can't do that job.
Gotta go.
Okay.
Well, it was very, very nice to meet you, Miranda girl.
Emily?
Call James Holt's office. Tell them I want to move the preview up to today at 12:30.
Tell everybody else. Be ready to leave in half an hour.
But we're not expected until Tuesday. Did she say why?
Yes. Yeah, she explained every detail of her decision making.
And then we brushed each other's hair and gabbed about American Idol.
I see your point.
- what's a preview anyway? -Good morning, Miranda.
 Miranda insists upon seeing all the designers'collections‚Ä¶
before they show them.
-Great to see you. -Hello, James.
- And she tells them what she thinks? - In her way.
Uh, this season really began for me with a meditation‚Ä¶
on the intersection between East and west.
 There's a scale. One nod is good. Two nods is very good.
There's only been one actual smile on record, and that was Tom Ford in 2001.
An obi belt.
 She doesn't like it, she shakes her head.
This is the dress that we have designed specifically and exclusively for you.
 Then, of course, there's the pursing of the lips.
 Which means?
 Catastrophe.
 Just, uh‚Ä¶ Just go.
-I just don't understand. I'm appalled. -It's absurd. Appalled.
-You deal with it. -I'll talk to him.
So because she pursed her lips, he's gonna change his entire collection?
You still don't get it, do you?
Her opinion is the only one that matters.
-Call my husband and confirm dinner. -At Pastis? Done.
And I'll need a change of clothes.
Well, I've already messengered your outfit over to the shoot.
Fine. And, Andrea, I would like you to deliver the Book to my home tonight.
-Have Emily give you the key. -Mm-hmm.
-Guard this with your life. -Of course.
You know, if I can deliver the Book, that means I must have done something right.
I'm not a psycho.
Oh, and, you know, she called me Andrea?
I mean, she didn't call me Emily, which is‚Ä¶ Isn't that great?
Yeah, whoopee. Right.
Now, it's very important that you do exactly what I'm about to tell you.
Oh. Okay.
 The Book is assembled by 10:00, 10:30‚Ä¶
and you must wait around for it until then.
You will be delivering Miranda's dry cleaning with the Book.
Now, the car will take you straight to Miranda's townouse.
You let yourself in.
Andrea. You do not talk to anyone.
Do not look at anyone.
This is of the utmost importance. You must be invisible.
-Do you understand? -Uh-huh.
You open the door and you walk across the foyer.
You hang the dry cleaning in the closet across from the staircase.
-Uh‚Ä¶ -And you leave the Book on the table with the flowers.

-Shit! - It's that door to the left.
Okay.
 Thank you.
-You can give the Book to us. -Shh. Which‚Ä¶ Which table?
-It's okay. Come on up. -No, I can't. I can't.
-What? It's okay. -Come on.
-Yeah, come on. It's okay. -Please stop talking.
Or you can bring the Book upstairs. Emily does it all the time.
She does? Right. She does, all the time.
Yeah? Okay.

 what did you expect me to do, walk out in the middle of a cover shoot?
 I rushed out of an investment committee meeting‚Ä¶
and I sat there waiting for you for almost an hour.
I told you the cell phones didn't work. Nobody could get a signal out.
 I knew what everyone in that restaurant was thinking‚Ä¶
there he is, waiting for her again.
-Okay, okay! Okay, okay. -Oh, no. Shh!
It really wasrt that big a deal. I promise.
The twins said hello, so I said hello back.
-Then I went up the stairs to give her the Book and‚Ä¶ -You went upstairs?
Oh, my God. Why didn't you just climb into bed with her and ask for a bedtime story?
Okay, I made a mistake. I know.
Andrea, you don't understand.
If you get fired, that might jeopardize Paris for me.
If that happens, I will search every Blimpie's in the tristate area until I track you down.
She's gonna fire me?
I don't know. She's not happy.
 Andrea?

Miranda, about last night, I‚Ä¶
I need the new Harry Potter book for the twins.
Okay. Okay. I'll go down to Barnes & Noble right now.
Did you fall down and smack your little head on the pavement?
Not that I can recall.
We have all the published Harry Potter books. The twins want to know what happens next.
You want the unpublished manuscript?
We know everyone in publishing. It shouldn't be a problem, should it?
And you can do anything, right?

Yes, Bobbsey. I know, baby.
Mommy's working very hard to get it for you.
She doesn't get it.
I could call frickirJ.K. Rowling herself. I'm not gonna get a copy of that book.
My girls are leaving on the train for their grandmother's at 4:00‚Ä¶
so the book better be here no later than 3:00.
-Of course! -And I would like my steak here in 15 minutes.
No problem! 
Okay. I have four hours to get the impossible manuscript.
Smith & Wollensky's doesn't open until 11:30. How am I gonna get the steak?
Okay. I will be back in 15 minutes.
-Wish me luck! -No. Shart.
Yes, yes, yes, yes. I've been on hold. It's for Miranda Priestly.
It's very important.
Yes, I know it's impossible to get‚Ä¶
but, well, I was wondering if you could make the impossible possible‚Ä¶
if that's at all possible. 
Yes, I'm calling about the Harry Potter manuscript.
Uh, no. Unpublished.
Not a chance?
Tell her that it's for Miranda Priestly.
'Cause I think it makes a difference.
Let me call you back.
You probably don't remember me. We met atJames Holt's party.
I'm Miranda Priestly's assistant.
The Harry Potter manuscript?Oh, you're kidding.
Uh, sorry to ask, but I'm desperate.
Just tell her it can't be done. You'll have to come up with a Plan ""B.""
Well, this is Miranda Priestly we're talking about.
There is no Plan ""B."" There's only Plan ""A.""
Is she back? Am I fired?
I rarely say this to people who aren't me‚Ä¶
but you have got to calm down.
Bloody hell!

Who?

Get them in here immediately, Kurt - we do not have time for this!

Is everyone clear on the situation?

I have had the truth revealed to be many times by this... ""Oscar"". It has taken years of practice, but I taught myself to retain my memories through my regenerations.

Doctor Manhattan:
Arise, warrior.
Thanos:
Where am I? Who are you?
Doctor Manhattan:
I don‚Äôt have time to explain. In a few days, you will be forced to battle in an Arena. Unless you do as I say, you will lose.
Remember these words:
""Her power is unbeatable, but it wasn‚Äôt always"".
Thanos:
Whose power? What are you talking about?

When the time comes,

I told you - I was entertained. I crocheted a rather smashing Christmas sweater.

Great. I know what I‚Äôm getting.

When the doors opened, I stepped out and you all know the rest. Speaking of which... You tricked me, man.

That‚Äôs ""Doctor"" Man.
Captain Kirk:
Well, now that we‚Äôre all awake, why don‚Äôt you just beam us all out of here?

Rocket:

Korg:
Uh, guys... I think we need to address the Godzilla in the room, which is the fact that‚Ä¶ Godzilla is in the room. And King Kong. And Optimal Price.
This makes no sense.
The Doctor:
It appears there's a spatial displacement field within these cells that allows beings of great size to occupy smaller volumes. Textbook dimensional transcendentality.

Ok then. That‚Äôs poured a tonne of concrete into that plot hole.
(Katana speaks Japanese with subtitles reading: ""What's with that guy?"")

I‚Äôm not working with her until she bends the knee.

How ‚Äòbout I bend it in your face?

I‚Äôm not working with him. He killed my parents.
Luke Skywalker:
It‚Äôs better than him being your parent.
Gamora:
It‚Äôs better than your parent killing you.
Thanos:
Adoptive parent.
Han Solo:
It‚Äôs better than the parent being killed by the child.
Ego:
Agreed.

It‚Äôs better than your sister taking one of your eyes!

Are you sure it wasn‚Äôt you they adopted?
Darth Vader:
Cards on the table: You were an accident.

Oh, that's great! That's great...!

The Showdown begins... now.
Deadpool:
Much as I hate disappointing the people at home.
(Deadpool throws down his katanas)
Harley Quinn:
What are you doing?
Deadpool:
I can‚Äôt fight you.
Harley Quinn:
And why not? If it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm a girl than you are dead, minus the ‚Äúpool‚Äù.
Deadpool:
Of course not. It‚Äôs because I dig you. And I just can‚Äôt bury someone I dig.
Harley Quinn:
What?
Deadpool:
I think we may actually be soulmates.
Harley Quinn:
OK. This is a trick, right? Although I‚Äôm not sure why you‚Äôd have to trick me in order to win. From the footage I‚Äôve seen, you‚Äôre pretty much invincible.
Deadpool:
Not entirely. And believe me, If you hit me with that bat, you‚Äôd win, hands down. Because you see, I can repair any part of me that breaks... except my heart.
(Harley Quinn drops her bat)
(Two floating orbs fly down next to Harley Quinn and Deadpool)

Oh, please. You couldn‚Äôt scratch a scratch-and-sniff with that manicure.

Hey! If either of you think you can beat me in a claw measuring contest, you‚Äôre dreaming!

Maybe it was a bite. I was knacking on his feet for a while there.
Alice:
Ew.
El Diablo:
Maybe it‚Äôs a burn.
Poison Ivy:
Maybe it‚Äôs a rash.
Mr. Freeze:
Maybe... it‚Äôs frostbite!

Maybe it was the same way I got my scars: Someone gave him a harmonica made from recycled soda cans.
Wasp:
Guys, it‚Äôs a scratch. The scratch analysis was conclusive.
Jareth:
The only way to know what caused the scratch is to turn back time. If only we could!
Nebula:
We can! Strange! Stop checking futures. We need you to check the past!

Ten minutes? That‚Äôs hardly worth my time!
(Hermione Granger, the T-800, Dr. Evil, The Doctor, Bill Preston, Doctor Strange, and Ted Logan step forward)

We‚Äôre coming too.

Expando minivan-o!

Climb aboard. Watch the leather!

Yes I am. And what‚Äôs your name?
Ron Weasley:
Hermione, can I come?
Hermione Granger:
Sorry Ron. Time travellers only.

I travel through time! I travel forwards, in real time.

Where we‚Äôre going, we don‚Äôt need Ron Weasley.

You what?

(The audience boos)
Female Audience Member:
Boo! That didn‚Äôt go the distance at all!
Oscar:
People, please - this is still in its infancy. The more movies Earth makes, the more characters there will be. Imagine this battle in 80 years.
Female Audience Member:
We don‚Äôt live that long!
Male Audience Member:
Hey, what‚Äôs that up there?
Marty McFly:
Time to go!
The Doctor:
Allons-y!

Oh. Sorry.
(Ant-Man lets go of the DeLorean)
Marty McFly:
Doc, what are we doing in a previous Super-Hero-Bowl?
Dr. Emmett Brown:
We've only made it 99% of the way because we‚Äôve run out of plutonium!
The Doctor:
What - you don‚Äôt have backup?
Dr. Evil:
Who travels through time without contingency plutonium? Honestly!
Dr. Emmett Brown:
The only power source capable of generating the 1.21 jigowatts of electricity we need is a bolt of lightning! Unfortunately, you never know when or where one‚Äôs ever gonna STRIKE!
(A lightning bolt strikes Ant-Man through the chest)

Hermione Granger:
I borrowed it from a friend.
Bill Preston:
There‚Äôs nothing there.
Dr. Evil:
I knew that gingernut was poor but who lends somebody air?
Hermione Granger:
Not him! My other friend! It‚Äôs an invisibility cloak. Watch.
(Hermione Granger puts on the invisibility cloak and turns invisible)
Hermione Granger:
It‚Äôs literally the greatest cloak ever!

Elementary, my dear Wa-

No, you idiot. Gold is what hurts him.

So I heard you found somebody else
And at first, I thought it was a lie
I took all my things that make sounds
The rest I can do without

I don't want your body
But I hate to think about you with somebody else
Our love has gone cold
You're intertwining your soul with somebody else
I'm looking through you
While you're looking through your phone
And then leaving with somebody else

You said you'd find someone to take my place (Place, place)
I just don't believe that you have got it in you
'Cause we are just gonna keep ‚ÄúDoin' it‚Äù and every time

When I was younger, I saw
My daddy cry and curse at the wind
He broke his own heart and I watched
As he tried to reassemble it
And my mama swore that she would
Never let herself forget
And that was the day that I promised
I'd never sing of love if it does not exist

But, darling, you are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception

Maybe I know somewhere
Deep in my soul that love never lasts
And we've got to find other ways
To make it alone or keep a straight face
And I've always lived like this
Keeping a comfortable distance
And up until now, I had sworn
To myself that I'm content with loneliness
Because none of it was ever worth the risk

Leave you? Leave you?
How could I leave you?
How could I go it alone?
Could I wave the years away
With a quick goodbye?
How do you wipe tears away
When your eyes are dry?
Sweetheart, lover
Could I recover?
Give up the joys I have known?
Not to fetch your pills again
Every day at five
Not to give those dinners for ten
Elderly men

How could I survive?
Could I leave you?
And your shelves of the world's best books
And the evenings of martyred looks
Cryptic sighs
Sullen glares from those injured eyes?
Leave the quips with a sting, jokes with a sneer
Passionless love-making once a year?
Leave the lies ill-concealed
And the wounds never healed
And the game's not worth winning

""villain and tyrant,""
""began kissing Katia.""
Svidriga√Ølov treated Katia and the organ-grinder and some singers and the waiters and two little clerks. He was particularly drawn to these clerks by the fact that they both had crooked noses, one bent to the left and the other to the right. They took him finally to a pleasure garden, where he paid for their entrance. There was one lanky three-year-old pine-tree and three bushes in the garden, besides a ""Vauxhall,"" which was in reality a drinking-bar where tea too was served, and there were a few green tables and chairs standing round it. A chorus of wretched singers and a drunken but exceedingly depressed German clown from Munich with a red nose entertained the public. The clerks quarrelled with some other clerks and a fight seemed imminent. Svidriga√Ølov was chosen to decide the dispute. He listened to them for a quarter of an hour, but they shouted so loud that there was no possibility of understanding them. The only fact that seemed certain was that one of them had stolen something and had even succeeded in selling it on the spot to a Jew, but would not share the spoil with his companion. Finally it appeared that the stolen object was a teaspoon belonging to the Vauxhall. It was missed and the affair began to seem troublesome. Svidriga√Ølov paid for the spoon, got up, and walked out of the garden. It was about six o'clock. He had not drunk a drop of wine all this time and had ordered tea more for the sake of appearances than anything.
It was a dark and stifling evening. Threatening storm-clouds came over the sky about ten o'clock. There was a clap of thunder, and the rain came down like a waterfall. The water fell not in drops, but beat on the earth in streams. There were flashes of lightning every minute and each flash lasted while one could count five.
Drenched to the skin, he went home, locked himself in, opened the bureau, took out all his money and tore up two or three papers. Then, putting the money in his pocket, he was about to change his clothes, but, looking out of the window and listening to the thunder and the rain, he gave up the idea, took up his hat and went out of the room without locking the door. He went straight to Sonia. She was at home.
She was not alone: the four Kapernaumov children were with her. She was giving them tea. She received Svidriga√Ølov in respectful silence, looking wonderingly at his soaking clothes. The children all ran away at once in indescribable terror.
Svidriga√Ølov sat down at the table and asked Sonia to sit beside him. She timidly prepared to listen.
""I may be going to America, Sofya Semyonovna,"" said Svidriga√Ølov, ""and as I am probably seeing you for the last time, I have come to make some arrangements. Well, did you see the lady to-day? I know what she said to you, you need not tell me."" (Sonia made a movement and blushed.) ""Those people have their own way of doing things. As to your sisters and your brother, they are really provided for and the money assigned to them I've put into safe keeping and have received acknowledgments. You had better take charge of the receipts, in case anything happens. Here, take them! Well now, that's settled. Here are three 5-per-cent bonds to the value of three thousand roubles. Take those for yourself, entirely for yourself, and let that be strictly between ourselves, so that no one knows of it, whatever you hear. You will need the money, for to go on living in the old way, Sofya Semyonovna, is bad, and besides there is no need for it now.""
""I am so much indebted to you, and so are the children and my stepmother,"" said Sonia hurriedly, ""and if I've said so little... please don't consider...""
""That's enough! that's enough!""
""But as for the money, Arkady Ivanovitch, I am very grateful to you, but I don't need it now. I can always earn my own living. Don't think me ungrateful. If you are so charitable, that money....""
""It's for you, for you, Sofya Semyonovna, and please don't waste words over it. I haven't time for it. You will want it. Rodion Romanovitch has two alternatives: a bullet in the brain or Siberia."" (Sonia looked wildly at him, and started.) ""Don't be uneasy, I know all about it from himself and I am not a gossip; I won't tell anyone. It was good advice when you told him to give himself up and confess. It would be much better for him. Well, if it turns out to be Siberia, he will go and you will follow him. That's so, isn't it? And if so, you'll need money. You'll need it for him, do you understand? Giving it to you is the same as my giving it to him. Besides, you promised Amalia Ivanovna to pay what's owing. I heard you. How can you undertake such obligations so heedlessly, Sofya Semyonovna? It was Katerina Ivanovna's debt and not yours, so you ought not to have taken any notice of the German woman. You can't get through the world like that. If you are ever questioned about me‚Äîto-morrow or the day after you will be asked‚Äîdon't say anything about my coming to see you now and don't show the money to anyone or say a word about it. Well, now good-bye."" (He got up.) ""My greetings to Rodion Romanovitch. By the way, you'd better put the money for the present in Mr. Razumihin's keeping. You know Mr. Razumihin? Of course you do. He's not a bad fellow. Take it to him to-morrow or... when the time comes. And till then, hide it carefully.""
Sonia too jumped up from her chair and looked in dismay at Svidriga√Ølov. She longed to speak, to ask a question, but for the first moments she did not dare and did not know how to begin.
""How can you... how can you be going now, in such rain?""
""Why, be starting for America, and be stopped by rain! Ha, ha! Good-bye, Sofya Semyonovna, my dear! Live and live long, you will be of use to others. By the way... tell Mr. Razumihin I send my greetings to him. Tell him Arkady Ivanovitch Svidriga√Ølov sends his greetings. Be sure to.""
He went out, leaving Sonia in a state of wondering anxiety and vague apprehension.
It appeared afterwards that on the same evening, at twenty past eleven, he made another very eccentric and unexpected visit. The rain still persisted. Drenched to the skin, he walked into the little flat where the parents of his betrothed lived, in Third Street in Vassilyevsky Island. He knocked some time before he was admitted, and his visit at first caused great perturbation; but Svidriga√Ølov could be very fascinating when he liked, so that the first, and indeed very intelligent surmise of the sensible parents that Svidriga√Ølov had probably had so much to drink that he did not know what he was doing vanished immediately. The decrepit father was wheeled in to see Svidriga√Ølov by the tender and sensible mother, who as usual began the conversation with various irrelevant questions. She never asked a direct question, but began by smiling and rubbing her hands and then, if she were obliged to ascertain something‚Äîfor instance, when Svidriga√Ølov would like to have the wedding‚Äîshe would begin by interested and almost eager questions about Paris and the court life there, and only by degrees brought the conversation round to Third Street. On other occasions this had of course been very impressive, but this time Arkady Ivanovitch seemed particularly impatient, and insisted on seeing his betrothed at once, though he had been informed, to begin with, that she had already gone to bed. The girl of course appeared.
Svidriga√Ølov informed her at once that he was obliged by very important affairs to leave Petersburg for a time, and therefore brought her fifteen thousand roubles and begged her accept them as a present from him, as he had long been intending to make her this trifling present before their wedding. The logical connection of the present with his immediate departure and the absolute necessity of visiting them for that purpose in pouring rain at midnight was not made clear. But it all went off very well; even the inevitable ejaculations of wonder and regret, the inevitable questions were extraordinarily few and restrained. On the other hand, the gratitude expressed was most glowing and was reinforced by tears from the most sensible of mothers. Svidriga√Ølov got up, laughed, kissed his betrothed, patted her cheek, declared he would soon come back, and noticing in her eyes, together with childish curiosity, a sort of earnest dumb inquiry, reflected and kissed her again, though he felt sincere anger inwardly at the thought that his present would be immediately locked up in the keeping of the most sensible of mothers. He went away, leaving them all in a state of extraordinary excitement, but the tender mamma, speaking quietly in a half whisper, settled some of the most important of their doubts, concluding that Svidriga√Ølov was a great man, a man of great affairs and connections and of great wealth‚Äîthere was no knowing what he had in his mind. He would start off on a journey and give away money just as the fancy took him, so that there was nothing surprising about it. Of course it was strange that he was wet through, but Englishmen, for instance, are even more eccentric, and all these people of high society didn't think of what was said of them and didn't stand on ceremony. Possibly, indeed, he came like that on purpose to show that he was not afraid of anyone. Above all, not a word should be said about it, for God knows what might come of it, and the money must be locked up, and it was most fortunate that Fedosya, the cook, had not left the kitchen. And above all not a word must be said to that old cat, Madame Resslich, and so on and so on. They sat up whispering till two o'clock, but the girl went to bed much earlier, amazed and rather sorrowful.
Svidriga√Ølov meanwhile, exactly at midnight, crossed the bridge on the way back to the mainland. The rain had ceased and there was a roaring wind. He began shivering, and for one moment he gazed at the black waters of the Little Neva with a look of special interest, even inquiry. But he soon felt it very cold, standing by the water; he turned and went towards Y. Prospect. He walked along that endless street for a long time, almost half an hour, more than once stumbling in the dark on the wooden pavement, but continually looking for something on the right side of the street. He had noticed passing through this street lately that there was a hotel somewhere towards the end, built of wood, but fairly large, and its name he remembered was something like Adrianople. He was not mistaken: the hotel was so conspicuous in that God-forsaken place that he could not fail to see it even in the dark. It was a long, blackened wooden building, and in spite of the late hour there were lights in the windows and signs of life within. He went in and asked a ragged fellow who met him in the corridor for a room. The latter, scanning Svidriga√Ølov, pulled himself together and led him at once to a close and tiny room in the distance, at the end of the corridor, under the stairs. There was no other, all were occupied. The ragged fellow looked inquiringly.
""Is there tea?"" asked Svidriga√Ølov.
""Yes, sir.""
""What else is there?""
""Veal, vodka, savouries.""
""Bring me tea and veal.""
""And you want nothing else?"" he asked with apparent surprise.
""Nothing, nothing.""
The ragged man went away, completely disillusioned.
""It must be a nice place,"" thought Svidriga√Ølov. ""How was it I didn't know it? I expect I look as if I came from a caf√© chantant and have had some adventure on the way. It would be interesting to know who stay here?""
He lighted the candle and looked at the room more carefully. It was a room so low-pitched that Svidriga√Ølov could only just stand up in it; it had one window; the bed, which was very dirty, and the plain-stained chair and table almost filled it up. The walls looked as though they were made of planks, covered with shabby paper, so torn and dusty that the pattern was indistinguishable, though the general colour‚Äîyellow‚Äîcould still be made out. One of the walls was cut short by the sloping ceiling, though the room was not an attic but just under the stairs.
Svidriga√Ølov set down the candle, sat down on the bed and sank into thought. But a strange persistent murmur which sometimes rose to a shout in the next room attracted his attention. The murmur had not ceased from the moment he entered the room. He listened: someone was upbraiding and almost tearfully scolding, but he heard only one voice.
Svidriga√Ølov got up, shaded the light with his hand and at once he saw light through a crack in the wall; he went up and peeped through. The room, which was somewhat larger than his, had two occupants. One of them, a very curly-headed man with a red inflamed face, was standing in the pose of an orator, without his coat, with his legs wide apart to preserve his balance, and smiting himself on the breast. He reproached the other with being a beggar, with having no standing whatever. He declared that he had taken the other out of the gutter and he could turn him out when he liked, and that only the finger of Providence sees it all. The object of his reproaches was sitting in a chair, and had the air of a man who wants dreadfully to sneeze, but can't. He sometimes turned sheepish and befogged eyes on the speaker, but obviously had not the slightest idea what he was talking about and scarcely heard it. A candle was burning down on the table; there were wine-glasses, a nearly empty bottle of vodka, bread and cucumber, and glasses with the dregs of stale tea. After gazing attentively at this, Svidriga√Ølov turned away indifferently and sat down on the bed.
The ragged attendant, returning with the tea, could not resist asking him again whether he didn't want anything more, and again receiving a negative reply, finally withdrew. Svidriga√Ølov made haste to drink a glass of tea to warm himself, but could not eat anything. He began to feel feverish. He took off his coat and, wrapping himself in the blanket, lay down on the bed. He was annoyed. ""It would have been better to be well for the occasion,"" he thought with a smile. The room was close, the candle burnt dimly, the wind was roaring outside, he heard a mouse scratching in the corner and the room smelt of mice and of leather. He lay in a sort of reverie: one thought followed another. He felt a longing to fix his imagination on something. ""It must be a garden under the window,"" he thought. ""There's a sound of trees. How I dislike the sound of trees on a stormy night, in the dark! They give one a horrid feeling."" He remembered how he had disliked it when he passed Petrovsky Park just now. This reminded him of the bridge over the Little Neva and he felt cold again as he had when standing there. ""I never have liked water,"" he thought, ""even in a landscape,"" and he suddenly smiled again at a strange idea: ""Surely now all these questions of taste and comfort ought not to matter, but I've become more particular, like an animal that picks out a special place... for such an occasion. I ought to have gone into the Petrovsky Park! I suppose it seemed dark, cold, ha-ha! As though I were seeking pleasant sensations!... By the way, why haven't I put out the candle?"" he blew it out. ""They've gone to bed next door,"" he thought, not seeing the light at the crack. ""Well, now, Marfa Petrovna, now is the time for you to turn up; it's dark, and the very time and place for you. But now you won't come!""
He suddenly recalled how, an hour before carrying out his design on Dounia, he had recommended Raskolnikov to trust her to Razumihin's keeping. ""I suppose I really did say it, as Raskolnikov guessed, to tease myself. But what a rogue that Raskolnikov is! He's gone through a good deal. He may be a successful rogue in time when he's got over his nonsense. But now he's too eager for life. These young men are contemptible on that point. But, hang the fellow! Let him please himself, it's nothing to do with me.""
He could not get to sleep. By degrees Dounia's image rose before him, and a shudder ran over him. ""No, I must give up all that now,"" he thought, rousing himself. ""I must think of something else. It's queer and funny. I never had a great hatred for anyone, I never particularly desired to avenge myself even, and that's a bad sign, a bad sign, a bad sign. I never liked quarrelling either, and never lost my temper‚Äîthat's a bad sign too. And the promises I made her just now, too‚ÄîDamnation! But‚Äîwho knows?‚Äîperhaps she would have made a new man of me somehow....""
He ground his teeth and sank into silence again. Again Dounia's image rose before him, just as she was when, after shooting the first time, she had lowered the revolver in terror and gazed blankly at him, so that he might have seized her twice over and she would not have lifted a hand to defend herself if he had not reminded her. He recalled how at that instant he felt almost sorry for her, how he had felt a pang at his heart...
""A√Øe! Damnation, these thoughts again! I must put it away!""
He was dozing off; the feverish shiver had ceased, when suddenly something seemed to run over his arm and leg under the bedclothes. He started. ""Ugh! hang it! I believe it's a mouse,"" he thought, ""that's the veal I left on the table."" He felt fearfully disinclined to pull off the blanket, get up, get cold, but all at once something unpleasant ran over his leg again. He pulled off the blanket and lighted the candle. Shaking with feverish chill he bent down to examine the bed: there was nothing. He shook the blanket and suddenly a mouse jumped out on the sheet. He tried to catch it, but the mouse ran to and fro in zigzags without leaving the bed, slipped between his fingers, ran over his hand and suddenly darted under the pillow. He threw down the pillow, but in one instant felt something leap on his chest and dart over his body and down his back under his shirt. He trembled nervously and woke up.
The room was dark. He was lying on the bed and wrapped up in the blanket as before. The wind was howling under the window. ""How disgusting,"" he thought with annoyance.
He got up and sat on the edge of the bedstead with his back to the window. ""It's better not to sleep at all,"" he decided. There was a cold damp draught from the window, however; without getting up he drew the blanket over him and wrapped himself in it. He was not thinking of anything and did not want to think. But one image rose after another, incoherent scraps of thought without beginning or end passed through his mind. He sank into drowsiness. Perhaps the cold, or the dampness, or the dark, or the wind that howled under the window and tossed the trees roused a sort of persistent craving for the fantastic. He kept dwelling on images of flowers, he fancied a charming flower garden, a bright, warm, almost hot day, a holiday‚ÄîTrinity day. A fine, sumptuous country cottage in the English taste overgrown with fragrant flowers, with flower beds going round the house; the porch, wreathed in climbers, was surrounded with beds of roses. A light, cool staircase, carpeted with rich rugs, was decorated with rare plants in china pots. He noticed particularly in the windows nosegays of tender, white, heavily fragrant narcissus bending over their bright, green, thick long stalks. He was reluctant to move away from them, but he went up the stairs and came into a large, high drawing-room and again everywhere‚Äîat the windows, the doors on to the balcony, and on the balcony itself‚Äîwere flowers. The floors were strewn with freshly-cut fragrant hay, the windows were open, a fresh, cool, light air came into the room. The birds were chirruping under the window, and in the middle of the room, on a table covered with a white satin shroud, stood a coffin. The coffin was covered with white silk and edged with a thick white frill; wreaths of flowers surrounded it on all sides. Among the flowers lay a girl in a white muslin dress, with her arms crossed and pressed on her bosom, as though carved out of marble. But her loose fair hair was wet; there was a wreath of roses on her head. The stern and already rigid profile of her face looked as though chiselled of marble too, and the smile on her pale lips was full of an immense unchildish misery and sorrowful appeal. Svidriga√Ølov knew that girl; there was no holy image, no burning candle beside the coffin; no sound of prayers: the girl had drowned herself. She was only fourteen, but her heart was broken. And she had destroyed herself, crushed by an insult that had appalled and amazed that childish soul, had smirched that angel purity with unmerited disgrace and torn from her a last scream of despair, unheeded and brutally disregarded, on a dark night in the cold and wet while the wind howled....
Svidriga√Ølov came to himself, got up from the bed and went to the window. He felt for the latch and opened it. The wind lashed furiously into the little room and stung his face and his chest, only covered with his shirt, as though with frost. Under the window there must have been something like a garden, and apparently a pleasure garden. There, too, probably there were tea-tables and singing in the daytime. Now drops of rain flew in at the window from the trees and bushes; it was dark as in a cellar, so that he could only just make out some dark blurs of objects. Svidriga√Ølov, bending down with elbows on the window-sill, gazed for five minutes into the darkness; the boom of a cannon, followed by a second one, resounded in the darkness of the night. ""Ah, the signal! The river is overflowing,"" he thought. ""By morning it will be swirling down the street in the lower parts, flooding the basements and cellars. The cellar rats will swim out, and men will curse in the rain and wind as they drag their rubbish to their upper storeys. What time is it now?"" And he had hardly thought it when, somewhere near, a clock on the wall, ticking away hurriedly, struck three.
""Aha! It will be light in an hour! Why wait? I'll go out at once straight to the park. I'll choose a great bush there drenched with rain, so that as soon as one's shoulder touches it, millions of drops drip on one's head.""
He moved away from the window, shut it, lighted the candle, put on his waistcoat, his overcoat and his hat and went out, carrying the candle, into the passage to look for the ragged attendant who would be asleep somewhere in the midst of candle-ends and all sorts of rubbish, to pay him for the room and leave the hotel. ""It's the best minute; I couldn't choose a better.""
He walked for some time through a long narrow corridor without finding anyone and was just going to call out, when suddenly in a dark corner between an old cupboard and the door he caught sight of a strange object which seemed to be alive. He bent down with the candle and saw a little girl, not more than five years old, shivering and crying, with her clothes as wet as a soaking house-flannel. She did not seem afraid of Svidriga√Ølov, but looked at him with blank amazement out of her big black eyes. Now and then she sobbed as children do when they have been crying a long time, but are beginning to be comforted. The child's face was pale and tired, she was numb with cold. ""How can she have come here? She must have hidden here and not slept all night."" He began questioning her. The child suddenly becoming animated, chattered away in her baby language, something about ""mammy"" and that ""mammy would beat her,"" and about some cup that she had ""bwoken."" The child chattered on without stopping. He could only guess from what she said that she was a neglected child, whose mother, probably a drunken cook, in the service of the hotel, whipped and frightened her; that the child had broken a cup of her mother's and was so frightened that she had run away the evening before, had hidden for a long while somewhere outside in the rain, at last had made her way in here, hidden behind the cupboard and spent the night there, crying and trembling from the damp, the darkness and the fear that she would be badly beaten for it. He took her in his arms, went back to his room, sat her on the bed, and began undressing her. The torn shoes which she had on her stockingless feet were as wet as if they had been standing in a puddle all night. When he had undressed her, he put her on the bed, covered her up and wrapped her in the blanket from her head downwards. She fell asleep at once. Then he sank into dreary musing again.
""What folly to trouble myself,"" he decided suddenly with an oppressive feeling of annoyance. ""What idiocy!"" In vexation he took up the candle to go and look for the ragged attendant again and make haste to go away. ""Damn the child!"" he thought as he opened the door, but he turned again to see whether the child was asleep. He raised the blanket carefully. The child was sleeping soundly, she had got warm under the blanket, and her pale cheeks were flushed. But strange to say that flush seemed brighter and coarser than the rosy cheeks of childhood. ""It's a flush of fever,"" thought Svidriga√Ølov. It was like the flush from drinking, as though she had been given a full glass to drink. Her crimson lips were hot and glowing; but what was this? He suddenly fancied that her long black eyelashes were quivering, as though the lids were opening and a sly crafty eye peeped out with an unchildlike wink, as though the little girl were not asleep, but pretending. Yes, it was so. Her lips parted in a smile. The corners of her mouth quivered, as though she were trying to control them. But now she quite gave up all effort, now it was a grin, a broad grin; there was something shameless, provocative in that quite unchildish face; it was depravity, it was the face of a harlot, the shameless face of a French harlot. Now both eyes opened wide; they turned a glowing, shameless glance upon him; they laughed, invited him.... There was something infinitely hideous and shocking in that laugh, in those eyes, in such nastiness in the face of a child. ""What, at five years old?"" Svidriga√Ølov muttered in genuine horror. ""What does it mean?"" And now she turned to him, her little face all aglow, holding out her arms.... ""Accursed child!"" Svidriga√Ølov cried, raising his hand to strike her, but at that moment he woke up.
He was in the same bed, still wrapped in the blanket. The candle had not been lighted, and daylight was streaming in at the windows.
""I've had nightmare all night!"" He got up angrily, feeling utterly shattered; his bones ached. There was a thick mist outside and he could see nothing. It was nearly five. He had overslept himself! He got up, put on his still damp jacket and overcoat. Feeling the revolver in his pocket, he took it out and then he sat down, took a notebook out of his pocket and in the most conspicuous place on the title page wrote a few lines in large letters. Reading them over, he sank into thought with his elbows on the table. The revolver and the notebook lay beside him. Some flies woke up and settled on the untouched veal, which was still on the table. He stared at them and at last with his free right hand began trying to catch one. He tried till he was tired, but could not catch it. At last, realising that he was engaged in this interesting pursuit, he started, got up and walked resolutely out of the room. A minute later he was in the street.
A thick milky mist hung over the town. Svidriga√Ølov walked along the slippery dirty wooden pavement towards the Little Neva. He was picturing the waters of the Little Neva swollen in the night, Petrovsky Island, the wet paths, the wet grass, the wet trees and bushes and at last the bush.... He began ill-humouredly staring at the houses, trying to think of something else. There was not a cabman or a passer-by in the street. The bright yellow, wooden, little houses looked dirty and dejected with their closed shutters. The cold and damp penetrated his whole body and he began to shiver. From time to time he came across shop signs and read each carefully. At last he reached the end of the wooden pavement and came to a big stone house. A dirty, shivering dog crossed his path with its tail between its legs. A man in a greatcoat lay face downwards; dead drunk, across the pavement. He looked at him and went on. A high tower stood up on the left. ""Bah!"" he shouted, ""here is a place. Why should it be Petrovsky? It will be in the presence of an official witness anyway....""
He almost smiled at this new thought and turned into the street where there was the big house with the tower. At the great closed gates of the house, a little man stood with his shoulder leaning against them, wrapped in a grey soldier's coat, with a copper Achilles helmet on his head. He cast a drowsy and indifferent glance at Svidriga√Ølov. His face wore that perpetual look of peevish dejection, which is so sourly printed on all faces of Jewish race without exception. They both, Svidriga√Ølov and Achilles, stared at each other for a few minutes without speaking. At last it struck Achilles as irregular for a man not drunk to be standing three steps from him, staring and not saying a word.
""What do you want here?"" he said, without moving or changing his position.
""Nothing, brother, good morning,"" answered Svidriga√Ølov.
""This isn't the place.""
""I am going to foreign parts, brother.""
""To foreign parts?""
""To America.""
""America.""
Svidriga√Ølov took out the revolver and cocked it. Achilles raised his eyebrows.
""I say, this is not the place for such jokes!""
""Why shouldn't it be the place?""
""Because it isn't.""
""Well, brother, I don't mind that. It's a good place. When you are asked, you just say he was going, he said, to America.""
He put the revolver to his right temple.
""You can't do it here, it's not the place,"" cried Achilles, rousing himself, his eyes growing bigger and bigger.
Svidriga√Ølov pulled the trigger.Embed",en,LABEL_0,0.4813818335533142,LABEL_1,0.5186181664466858

""Enjoy yourself -- every day above ground is a good day. - ANONYMOUS, MIAMI 1981
1 A PROLOGUE
crawls up the screen -- with Narrator.
NARRATOR
In May 1980, Fidel Castro -- in an effort to normalize relations with the Carter Administration -- opened the harbor at Mariel, Cuba with the apparent intention of letting some of his people join their relatives in the United States. Within seventy-two hours, 3,000 U.S. boats were headed for Cuba. In the next few weeks, it became evident that Castro was forcing the boat owners to carry back with them not only their relatives but the dregs of his jail population. By the time the port was closed 125,000 'Marielitos' had landed in Florida. An estimated 25,000 had criminal records. This is the story of that minority -- those they call 'Los Bandidos.'
The prologue is shredded diagonally by the blade of a
stiletto and in the empty black void we:

The flag of the United States. Choppers swooping over the ragged coastline of the Keys. Emerald waters dotted with fishing trawlers and pleasure craft, an ""America the Beautiful""-type Immigration theme surging over this.

Long lines. Immigration and Nationalization Officials, customs, Public Health, FBI, Church and Relief Organizations.
Babies bawling, arguments over paperwork, refugees being

A FULL and CLOSEUP OF
7 TONY MONTANA 7
the scar-faced one, in the young angry prime of his life.
We dwell first on the scar which he likes to scratch now and
then. We move to the eyes, pure in their fury. Finally we
encompass the face -- the face of a man about to explode --
muscle, tissue, brain -- a man willing to live or die and
on the increment of a moment, inflict or receive either one.
He is clothed in rags crossed with holes, his shoes broken
cardboard, his hair unkempt, his complexion sallow from
prison.
Over this:
VOICE #1 (o.s.)
Okay so what do you call yourself?
VOICE #2 (o.s.)
Como se llama?
MONTANA
Tony Montana...you?
VOICE #1
Where'd you learn to speak the English, Tony?
MONTANA
My old man -- he was American. Sailor. Bum.
I always know, y'know, one day I gonna come to America.
I see all the movies...
VOICE #1
So where's your old man now?
MONTANA
He's dead. He died. Somewhere...
VOICE #1
Mother?
TONY
She's dead too.
VOICE #2
What kind of work you do in Cuba, Tony?
TONY
This. That. The Army. Some construction work....
VOICE #2
Unhunh. Got any family in the States, Tony? Cousins, brother-in-law?
TONY
(a beat)
Nobody. Everybody's dead.
MAN #I
Y'ever been in jail, Tony?
TONY
Me jail? No way.
We now reveal three men in civilian clothing in the dark afternoon light of the little room. Actually it's a plywood office somewhere in the processing hall and we hear the din from the hall over the question and answer. Two of the men sit around a desk, the Third Man stands in a corner, staring at Tony, the most authoritative-looking of the three.
MAN #l
(checking off a list)
You been in a mental hospital, Tony?
TONY
(grinning)
Yeah, in the boat coming over.
MAN #1
How 'bout homosexuality, Tony? You like men, y'like to dress up like a woman?
TONY
(to Man #2)
Never tried it. What the fuck's wrong with this guy, what's he think I am?
MAN #2
Just answer the questions, Tony.
The voices of the men remain cool and collected throughout.
TONY
(to Man #1)
Fuck no.
MAN #1
Arrested? Vagrancy? Marijuana?
TONY
NO. ...NO. Never. Nothing.
His eye movements are rapid (over shoulders, sides, doors)
and he does a lot of touching -- objects -- lightly with the
tips of the fingers. Man #3 is stepping forward out of the
shadows.
MAN #3
So where'd you get the beauty scar?
TONY
This?..
(scratching the scar, shrugs)
I was a kid. You should see the other kid.
(a grim chuckle)
MAN #3
And this?
He holds up Tony's hand and indicates the tattoo between the
thumb and second finger -- a heart with the word ""Madre""
scaled through it.
TONY
Oh that was for my sweetheart.
MAN #3
Sweetheart?
(to the other men)
We been seeing more and more of these. It's some kinda code these guys used in the can. Pitchfork means an assassin
or something. This one's new... You want to tell us, Montana or you want to take a little trip to the detention center?
TONY
Hey, so I was in the can once for buying dollars. Big deal.
MAN #3
That's pretty funny, Tony.
TONY
Some Canadian tourist....
MAN #3
What'd you mug him first? Get him outta here!
(starts to walk out)
TONY
Hey, so I fuck Castro, what's it to you? You a Communist or something?
How would you like it they tell you all the time what to think, what to do, you wanna be like a sheep, like everybody else. Baa baa? Puta! You want a stoolie on every block? You wanna work eight hours a day and you never own nothing? I ate octopus three times a day, fucking octopus is coming out my ears, fuckin' Russian shoes are eating through my feet. Whaddaya want? You want me to stay there? Hey, I'm no little whore, I'm no stinking thief! I'm Tony Montana and I'm a political prisoner here from Cuba and I want my fucking 'Human Rights' just like President Jimmy Carter says, okay?
Silence.
There's a certain eloquence to the man`s plea but
it falls on disbelieving ears. One of them chuckles.
MAN #l
Carter should see this human right. He's good. He's very good. What do you say Harry?
MAN #3

I... 'Freedomtown.' Let them take a look at him. A long look.
TONY
Hey, that's okay, too, Harry. No hard feelings.

The bus is packed with the harder-looking refugee-types.
The windows are caged and we see INS guards.
The noise level is high, like a sack of monkeys.
Manny (Manolo) Ribera's got his feet up on an empty seat.
He's big, strong, handsome, with dashing darkly feminine
eyes -- younger than Tony, and dapper in his cheap clothing.
He's eating a Baby Ruth candy bar.
MANNY
Seat's taken.
TONY
So I'll sit in your lap.
Tony pushes his feet off, sits. He takes the Baby Ruth out
of Manny's hand, peels out the bar of chocolate, then
returns the empty wrapper to Manny,
TONY
So what'd you tell them?
MANNY
I told them what you told me to tell them. I told them I was in sanitation in Cuba.
TONY
I didn't tell you sanitation. I told you to tell them you was in a sanitarium, not sanitation.
The bus pulling out now.
MANNY
Is that what you told me? You didn't tell me that.
TONY

The rag-tag audience is noisily yammering back at the screen,
the camera moving past Manny Ray, chewing gum, hair slicked,
eyes in cat-like repose... to Tony, enrapt, eyes like an eleven year old, mouth hanging open.
BOGART

Conscience. Conscience.
If you believe you've got a conscience, it`ll pester you to death. But if you don't believe you've got one, what can it do to you? Makes me sick so much talking and fussing about nonsense.

Tony is moving down 23rd Street, the walk proud and jungle
in the rock of the hips and the cast of the shoulders --
now accompanied by his handsome compadre, Manny.
TONY

MANNY
Fucking crazy, hunh!
TONY
That gold dust blowing in the wind.
Y'see Manny, he's always looking over his shoulder. Hunh? Like me....
He hunches, darting exaggerated looks over his shoulder,
imitating Bogart. Manny laughs. In his black shirt with
zig-zag dots and colors and the baggy pants and sunglasses,
Tony's starting to look American. He's even got himself a
pop button pinned to his shirt that says ""Fuck Off and Die.""
And his English rolls faster off his tongue, his confidence
more pronounced.
TONY
. . . don't trust nobody.
MANNY
Yeah all that gold, hunh -- I guess you get so crazy you never trust nobody no more.
TONY
Never happen to me, Chico. That's one thing I never gonna be. I never gonna be crazy like that.
MANNY
Yeah, how do you know....
TONY
I know.
MANNY
I don't know. Sometimes you crazy, too, Tony.
TONY
Assholes, I go crazy. You Manny, I never go crazy with you. You're
like my brother, I love you!
MANNY
Yeah, sure.
TONY
Hey, c'mon.
Tony playfully punches Manny and they walk on into the humid night, intersecting a young punk, Chi-Chi.
CHI-CHI
(to Manny; Spanish)
Hey Manny.
MANNY
Oye Chi-Chi, what's going down.
CHI-CHI
Usual shit. Want some peanuts? Pago's carrying tonight.
MANNY
I don't know, I get all fucked up on it....
CHI-CHI

Boulevard ---
MANNY
Oh yeah, what she look like?
CHI-CHI
She look like you 'cept she got a snatch.
MANNY
A real snatch?
CHI-CHI
You're not kidding. It talks.
As they chatter, Tony moves on with a movement of the head
for Manny. ""Later.""
He's in the middle of the ""Boulevard"" where a bustling black
market in toiletries, clothing, cigarettes, and transvestites is conducted nightly in the harsh glare of barrack neon.
He ambles past a bunch of young guys throwing a Frisbee,
past a ""Viva Carter!"" proclamation in graffiti....

What about you sugar -- you wanna party?

CUT TO
10 EXT. FREEDOMTOWN GROUNDS - NIGHT 10
Tony, five minutes later, in a phone booth, in the middle of a bank of them, dozens of Marielietos pressing to get in, trying still to contact somebody -- anybody -- on the outside.
Tony is dialing, his eyes shifting down to the telephone
number written in pencil on the back of a snapshot- As he
finishes the number, he flips the snapshot over and we see
a young girl, about thirteen years old, dark, tiny, fiery,
standing together with a dog and Tony, early twenties, in
shadow, the fringes of the photo heavily tattered with
handling. Tony stares at it, his mind drifting as the phone
rings in a distant place. A brief moment of repose we have
not yet seen in Tony.
Someone picks up the phone. An older woman's Voice. His
expression alters to uncertainty.
VOICE
Yes? ...Hello? ...Who is this?
Tony changes his mind, hangs up. Pause. The faces of those
in line peer in, the next party raps on the door, but Tony
ignores it, slips the snapshot back into the wallet in his
pants, then at his own pace, exits the phone booth.
He walks a few beats, his eyes pensive. Then recognizes
somebody in another phone booth and goes over.
Angel Fernandez has got the face of one, as he argues on
the phone, then hangs up, a desolate look on his face, a
worn phone book in his hand.
TONY
Angel, how ya doin'?
ANGEL
You know how many goddamn Fernandezes are living in fucking Union City? And I gotta call every fucking one of 'em to find my brother!
TONY
(in passing)
Don't waste your dime, Chico. You know your brother hates you.
ANGEL
Go fuck yourself, Tony.
Manny catches up to Tony.
TONY
Whatcha hanging around with that hustler for?
MANNY
Hey Chi-Chi's okay, he hears things,
TONY
What's he hear I don't hear.
Angel comes over, listens.
MANNY
He hears we got problems. Immigration is having these hearings, y ' know? And they're saying nine out of ten of us is gonna get shipped back!
TONY
Oh yeah?
MANNY
Yeah. And a lotta shit just went down at Indiantown Gap. In Pennsylvania. Riots, fires, broken heads... things are gonna pop here.
TONY
Shit, I coulda told you that.
MANNY
Yeah, so what do you think the immigration's gonna do when we riot? You think they're gonna let us out? They're gonna throw away the key, that's what.
ANGEL
Oh shit!
MANNY
What's I say. This is gonna end bad, muchachos....
TONY
Hey, I tell you guys this isn't Cuba here, this is the United States. They got nothing but lawyers here. We're on the television. We're in the newspapers. Whatta they gonna do -- ship us back to Cuba? Castro-- he don't want us. Nobody no place wants us so whatta they gonna do -- put us in a gas chamber so all the people can see? They're stuck with us, Chico -- they gotta let us go!
MANNY
Yeah, well, what if we gotta sit here another six months, hunh?
TONY
You worry too much, mi hermano. Like the man says, 'when you got 'em by the balls, their hearts and minds gonna follow' --hunh?
Tony winks and walks off.
The radio is playing hard rock, something like Blondie or Benatar from the stoop of a nearby barrack. Tony loves the sound and swings into it, snapping his fingers and rolling his hips like Presley. He back-peddles, smiling at Manny and Angel.
TONY
(in awful imitation)
'Oh yeah America! Love-to love you baby, oh yeah!'
CUT TO
11 EXT. PLAYING FIELD - DAY - TWO WEEKS LATER

Camera on Tony shuffling and feinting a soccer ball in an impromptu game; he's covered with sweat, tires a fancy move
around a younger kid who not only steals the ball away off him but manages to lay him flat on his face.
TONY
(lying there)
Aw fuck....
The game, leaving him behind, shifts downfield.
MANNY
Aye ! Tony! C'mon!
Manny, just arrived at the edge of the field, waves him off.
Tony, getting up, brushing himself off, walks off the field
towards him.
ANGEL
(at a distance)
Hey Tony where ya going?
TONY
I got better things to do.
ANGEL
Chicken liver, hunh?
TONY
(to Manny)
Yeah?
(looking zd)
Let's walk.
They walk.
MANNY
You ready for the good news, cone?
TONY
Yeah.
MANNY
We can be outta here in thirty days.
Not only that. We got a green card and a job in Miami! Hunh? We're made, Chico, we're made?
TONY
Yeah, whadda we gotta do, go to Cuba and hit the Beard or what?
Angel is walking towards them. Tony signals him.
MANNY
(shakes his head)
Forget it. Oh yeah -- there's a hundred greenbacks in it, For both of us.
TONY
(enthusiastic)
Hey you're kidding, that's great!
But Manny, you tell your guys Angel gets out with us.
As Rebenga, in long-lensed closeup, nervously smokes a
cigarette, eyes roving as the guard examines his papers.
CUT TO
13 MONTAGE - THE RIOT - FREEDOMTOWN - DAY
The visuals are swift, dispassionate and documentary-like.
The refugees storm the barbed wire at the main gate,
carrying bricks and wooden slats.
ALL
(in unison)
Libertad! Libertad!
14 NATIONAL GUARDSMEN AND STATE POLICE
form ranks outside.
15 REFUGEES
flee through a hole in the fence.
16 GUARDS
move on them, wielding clubs.
17 SEVERAL REFUGEES
are scooting down a highway.
18 POLICE DOGS
on chains are glimpsed.
19 REFUGEES
throw stones and debris from the rooftop of a barrack.
20 REBENGA
a cigarette in his mouth, nervously hurries into a barrack.
21 ANGEL
tracks him, signals....
22 INSIDE - REFUGEES
are pulling apart their beds, going for the wooden slats.
Others set fire to their mattresses.
23 THE POLICE AND GUARDS
are moving through the gates, restoring order. Loudspeakers
blast. Injured refugees lie bleeding on the grounds.
24 AN ENTIRE BARRACK
now goes up in flames.
25 INSIDE THE BARRACK
A bewildered Emilio Rebenga grabs his papers and valuables.
Manny runs up on him.
Rebenga sees him, senses danger, flees down the aisle with his satchel, intersecting other panicked refugees.
Manny follows.
Rebenga stumbles into a bed frame, shatters his glasses,
then runs on. Into the smoke and flame. Out of which Scarface now appears -- in his killing wrath.
TONY
Rebenga!
Rebenga snaps to the sound of the voice.
TONY
(Spanish)
From the friends you fucked!
The work is fast. The stiletto punches nine quick holes in his lungs and his heart...  And the figure of death is gone.
...And Emilio Rebenga staggers wildly in the smoke, uncomprehending eyes encased in broken glasses. Sinking out of frame.
26 EXT. FREEDOMTOWN - DAY
The riot is over. The grounds are still, smoke and debris the aftermath.
DISSOLVE TO
27 INT. PROCESSING ROOM - DAY - A MONTH LATER
An Immigration Officer passes a sheaf of documents across a desk into a pair of hands. The camera gliding along a Green Card pinned to the top of the stack.
It says ""ANTHONY MONTANA"" and it has picture and stamps. It's official, as the camera moves with triumphant immigration theme music to the face of Mr. Montana examining quite contentedly the rewards of his efforts.
End of montage. Music continues.
DISSOLVE TO
27-A EXT. DOWNTOWN MIAMI - SUNNY DAY
The new Miami is rising ubiquitously above Biscayne Bay,
the camera moving past blossoming skyscrapers, workmen,
huge cranes, glass, mirrors booming upwards into a
beautiful blue Florida sky, fleeced with perfectly white
clouds... past a giant billboard:
HOW ABOUT A MILLION DOLLAR LOAN?
COME TALK TO US...
AT THE BANCO DE MIAMI...
TODAY!
Past banks of glass (Caribank, Banco de Venezuela, Amerifirst)...
Insert a car sticker going by with the image of the American flag and the reminder: ""Will the last American leaving Miami please bring flag?""
Tony and Manny bop along the street in their hand-me-down
clothes, oogling the chicas and the bodegas (in a plush
modern area of Miami). Boats. Buildings. Cars.
TONY
(looking around)
Boy -- can you believe this place, Chico?
MANNY
(Spanish)
Man, they weren't kidding around.
TONY
(pointing to a little old man walking towards them)
See that old guy over there?
MANNY
Yeah.
TONY
Millionaire.
MANNY
How do you know?
TONY
Go over there. Ask him gimme some money. He'll give you the silver right outta his pants -- that's America man, that's what they do here.
MANNY
(almost believing)
Yeah? Hey Tony catch this tomato.
(adjusting his pants)
Ooooh baby doll...
A hot Cuban girl in heels comes down the sidewalk towards
them with a female friend.
TONY
Hey baby what you say?
She looks at him like he was the last thing in the world
she'd say anything to.
Tony waves her off, then changes his mind and runs up
behind her and throws up her skirt and peeks at her ass.
Before she can react, he hops away laughing as the two
Cuban girls ad-lib Spanish expletives at him.
MANNY
Hey that's not cool, man. You wanna score one of these chicks, watch me. Mira!
He wiggles his tongue up and down, fast like a small
whirring motor part, then slips it back into his mouth in
the flick of an eye.
TONY
...the fuck was that?
MANNY
You didn't see it? You weren't looking. Hey you gotta watch for it.
Does it again, quickly; it looks like a baby robin's head
peeking out of a nest in his teeth, then it's gone.
TONY
What the hell's that for -- eating bugs? That's disgustin'.
MANNY
You think so hunh? Well you don't know shit 'bout chicks Chico. When they see this, they know. They go crazy. They don't resist me.
Does it again. Tony tries but lacks the speed and agility, provoking Manny's laughter. Many double checks himself in a shop window.
MANNY
(doing it again)
Takes practice, mi sangre, but they just love it when you flop that pussy with it....
TONY
Oooh... cono! How 'bout that one?
Pointing to a tall, cool blonde across the avenue.
MANNY
No problem.
27-B EXT. MIAMI SHOPPING STREET - DAY
Tony walks right out into the avenue, sticking out his arm
and stopping traffic. Cars honk angrily but he couldn't
give a shit.
TONY
Come on?
Manny follows as Tony now moves across the opposite lane, a
car screeching to a halt in front of him.
TONY
(points)
Okay Rober Retfor, strut your stuff.
The blonde has paused to look in a shop window.
Manny stops alongside, pretends to look. When he catches
her eyes, he flicks his tongue.
She looks at him, confused, then back into the window.
Manny look back at Tony, winks, sidles closer to her.
Tony, waiting off to the side, catches the gaze of a somber
child, four, toddling along with it's mom. He makes his
own version of a funny face at the kid who looks back at
him puzzled. Tony produces another face. The kid now
smiles. The mother looks over. Tony shrugs. She smiles
and moves along.
Meanwhile, Manny has moved close to the blonde and suggests something, his eyebrows raising, the smile crooked. It takes a moment, then the blonde smacks him across the face
and walks away.
Tony walks over to him, mocking.
TONY
Pobre hijo de puta -- you got it all mixed up.
This country first you gotta get the money, then you get
the power and when you got the power, then you get the women -- and then, Chico, you got the world by the balls. Por los conjones.
MANNY
There you go talking big again man. You don't know shit about the world. Who was it got us the green card, who got us the friends with the connections, hunh -- who's getting us a job? You or me? Not you man. You lucky you have any friends. You lucky to have me as a friend....
As they walk off, backs to camera.
TONY
Yeah, so where's this job?
MANNY
Don't push man, my friends gonna take care of everything.
CUT TO
28 LITTLE HAVANA RESTAURANT - LITTLE HAVANA - NIGHT
on Southwest 8th Street. ""Calle Ocho""....
The parking lot is crammed with Moby Dick-size cars and
casual Cubans in sports clothes bunched in conversations
around their wheels or at the ice cream stand.
The inside is a brightly lit glitterdome with fancy mirrors and chandelier effects, Spanish in influence, and every table is taken. It combines the social functions of a family restaurant, cafe, tourist haunt and late-night watering hole for various beasts of prey.
The waitresses move like well-oiled troops along the paths
to the kitchen, turning the tables at a speedy rate. The
camera following past the pots and the pans and the steam
and the yelling cooks -- to the deepest, darkest recess of
this dungeon....
. . . To reveal Tony Montana stubbing grease off the pots and
Manny Ray washing a stack of dishes. They're filthy and
exhausted. A dish slips through Manny's fingers and crashes
to the floor. A look between them suffices to tell us all.
TONY
Your big shot friend better come up with something soon. I didn't come to America to break my fucking back, querido.
MANNY
(equally irritated)
Hey he's coming okay! What do you want?
CUT TO
29 INT./EXT. LITTLE HAVANA RESTAURANT - NIGHT - HOURS LATER
We are looking through a cubbyhole at the diners. Young
Cuban guys with chiquitas drift in with their fancy clothes,
diamonds and -- the mark of status -- large bodyguards.
They're out front with the flash, shaking hands with friends, kissing, talking loud, familiar with the waitresses.
Staring through the smeared window enrapt are Tony and
Manny, wiping the sweat off their faces with towels.
MANNY
Look at that chick man, wow! Look at them knockers.
TONY
Yeah, look at the punk with her.
What's he got that I don't got?
MANNY
He's good-looking that's what, look at his clothes, flash Chico, pizzazz! A little coke money don't hurt nobody...
TONY
Junkie! -- They got no fuckin' character.
(looks at his hands)
Cono! Look at these... fucking Onions! They outta be picking gold off the streets.
His hands are shriveled white from dishwater.
COOK
(Spanish)
Hey you two, outside! You got company...
MANNY
That's him -- El Mono's here!
TONY
(contemptuous of the name)
El Mono? Shit....
CUT TO
30 EXT. PARKING LOT OUTSIDE LITTLE HAVANA RESTAURANT - NIGHT
Omar Suarez (El Mono -- ""The Monkey"") is so named cause he
looks like one. Nervous, crooked, darting eyes, feverish
intelligence, constantly smoking a cigarette and coughing
between words, his face pock-marked and pitted like the moon from an old acne scars, he cuts a skinny figure at the wheel of a big beige Coupe De Ville, idling the motor... with him is Waldo Rojas eating a large foot and a half banana. In contrast he's amiable, heavyset with a receding hairline, flashing a lot of gold when he smiles.
MANNY
(leaning in the window)
Hey Omar, Waldo, coma esta... my friend I told you about. Tony Montana... Omar Suarez, Waldo Rojas....
Waldo mumbles something indistinct, Omar just stares briefly as Tony hangs back, nodding arrogantly. Omar's eyes move back to Manny.
OMAR
I got something for you.
MANNY
Oh yeah! That's great... What do we gotta do?
OMAR
We gotta unload a boat -- grass, twenty-five tons -- that's what we gotta do. You get five hundred each.
MANNY
Okay!
(to Tony)
See, what'd I tell you.
TONY
You gotta be kidding! Whaddayou think we are -- baggage handlers?
Omar looks at him somewhat incredulously as Tony wipes his hands on his greasy apron as he talks.
TONY
...five hundred dollars -- shit!
What'd I do for you guys in the slammer, hunh? What was the Rebenga hit -- game of dominoes or somethin'? You're talkin' to important guys here.
MANNY
(shocked)
Hey Tony, c'mon, it's okay Omar, we...
TONY
Shaddup!
Omar sniggers, his eyes shifting to Waldo who shakes his
head and laughs.
OMAR
(to Manny only)
So what's it with this dishwasher, Chico? Don't he think we coulda gotten some other space cadet to do Rebenga -- cheaper maybe. Fifty bucks?
TONY
(shrugs)
So why didn't you? And who the fuck you calling a dishwasher, I'll wipe your monekyshit ass all up and down this Boulevard.
Steps forward. Manny grabs him.
MANNY
Hey! -- Tony, Tony....
In the car, Omar looks over at Waldo.
OMAR
Guy's a lunatic, let's go.
WALDO
What about them Indians ---
The idea crosses Omar's mind, He buys it, somewhat amused.
OMAR
Yeah...
(back to Tony)
All right, smart ass, you wanna make some big bucks? You know anything about cocaine?
TONY
You kidding.
OMAR
...There's a bunch of Columbians. Flying in Friday. New guys. They say they got two keys for us for openers. Pure coke. In a motel over in Miami Beach. I want you to go over there, and if it's what they say it is, pay 'em and bring it back. You do that, you'll make five grand.
MANNY
(to Tony)
Hey, that sounds great, Tony...
Tony says nothing.
OMAR
You know how to handle a machine gun?
MANNY
Sure, we was in the Army together.
OMAR
You're gonna need a couple other guys...
MANNY
No problem.
OMAR
Meet me at Hector's bodega Friday at noon. You get the money then. Something happens to the money, pobrecito, and my boss' gonna stick your head up your asses faster'n a rabbit gets fucked.
Throws the remains of his cigarette at their feet and pulls the Coupe De Ville out of the lot.
TONY
I'm scared.
MANNY
(relieved)
Tony you're pushin' your luck.
TONY
(walking away)
You worry too much Manny -- you' re gonna get yourself a heart attack one of these days.
MANNY
(catching up)
Yeah, so who are these Colombians?
TONY
So what does it matter?
MANNY
So whatcha have that look on for when Omar bring it up?
Tony strips off his greasy apron.
TONY
So nothin'. I just don't like fuckin' Colombians that's what.
They're animals!
COOK
(intersecting, Spanish)
Where you greasers going, hunh, I got plenty of plates here.
TONY
Wash yourself. I just retired.
Throws the Cook his apron.
COOK
(Spanish)
What the fuck you gonna do!
TONY
Look after my investments.
CUT TO
31 EXT. MIAMI BEACH - DAY - MOVING SHOT
The somewhat run-down, art-deco cheaper hotels of South
Miami Beach. The porches are filled with senior citizens
playing cards, reading papers, staring, slowly walking the
street.
The ramshackle sedan, jammed with Tony and his gang,
rattles past. It's a beaten-up black and blue Monte Carlo,
jacked up on its springs with dune buggy threads and
needing paint. You'd arrest these guys on sight.
32 INT./EXT. TONY'S CADILLAC - MIAMI BEACH - DAY
seen from the inside of the sedan. Tony turns down the salsa beat on the radio, smoking a cigarette tensely. Manny is driving. In the dilapidated backseat are Angel, the baby-faced punk, and Chi-Chi, both from Freedomtown.
Manny, reflecting the tension, whistles a rapid series of notes under his breath as he waits for a light to change.
MANNY
Hey look at that chick, hunh? Lookit those tits man, she's begging for it!
At the curb, an old crone hunchbacks her way in front of the teenage chick, who is coming off the beach in a bikini, blocking her off.
CHI-CHI
(looking over)
Whatta you crazy? She's 103 years old.
MANNY
Not her stupido! Her....
Camera revealing the teenager.
TONY
(the light changing)
Drive, willya.
MANNY
(mocking)
Sure, sure. Not to worry, Tony -- You get a heart attack.
(looking in the rearview mirror)
Angel, whatcha wearing the face for?
ANGEL
(tense, making light of it)
Ah, it's okay. I just y'know forgot to make an offering. I was supposed to go by the madrina today.
MANNY
You still going to that cuncha?
ANGEL
She knows her shit. She talks to Yemaya and Chango like nobody y'ever heard.
As he talks Angel fingers a Negrita charm hanging around
his neck -- Chango, God of Fire and Thunder, his black face
tilted at a carnal angle. Sharp teeth glinting, his eyes
rolling in orgasmic imagery, his head crowned with gold.
Many of the Marielitos in the film will be wearing this,
also pendants with an eye to ward off the evil spirits, red
and white beads, red kerchiefs, black hand charms silver-
bangled bracelets, etc., all relating to their Afro-Catholic
spiritualism.
MANNY
(making fun)
Yeah, Chango looking out for us,
CHI-CHI
Angel?
ANGEL
Chango looking out for all the 'bandidos' everywhere. But you gotta pay him his dues, y'know. You gotta let him know you respect him. You don't, Chango -- he gets pissed an'...
TONY
(angry)
Hey, shaddup -- all of ya! I told you before I don't go for that mystical voodoo shit. That's for the old cunchas waving their rooster cocks in some dark alley, There's no gods, there's no Chango -- nowhere! You make your own luck. So shaddup and act like you're in the United States here.
Silence. Through the windshield, the sign of a motel -- THE SUN RAY -- is coming closer.
TONY
Okay, this is it. Pull over across the street.
The motel is coming closer in silence.
TONY
(to Manny)
Money stays in the trunk till I come out and get it. Me. Nobody else. If I'm not out in fifteen minutes, something's wrong. I'm in Room 9. You ready, Angelito?
ANGEL
Sure thing.
As Manny pulls the car up, they pull out Ingram Model-10
machine pistol with folding butt and suppressor, ten inches
of kill power capable of firing 1100 rounds a minute -- it
can be slipped into a man's purse, it's in vogue. Tony getting out, to Angel:
TONY
Let's go....
CUT TO
33 EXT. SUN-RAY MOTEL - DAY
Tony and Angel come slowly, gingerly down an exterior
corridor to a room marked ""9"". Nodding to Angel who remains in the stairwell with the Ingram machine pistol, Tony knocks.
Pause.
34 EXT. TOAD'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY
The door's opened casually by an ugly, squat five-foot-four-inch Colombian, ""The Toad"". He's in his forties, sports shirt hanging over his polyester pants, old acne scars on his face, like Omar; he's good natured, a nice guy, he smiles.
TOAD
Hey, oye amigo....
Spreading his arms in such a fashion to indicate he's clean.
35 INT. TOAD'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY
Tony, stepping into the conventionally tasteless orange and
blue motel room (with heavy blue drapes blocking the windows), spreads his hands in a similar posture indicating he too is not carrying; but this is only symbolic, it's not meant to be a body search.
TONY
(as he steps in)
How you doing amigo...?
The other person in the room is a tough-looking little dark
Colombian chick with expressionless eyes, red fingernails, and short boy-cut hair, ""The Lizard""; she's tinier than the Toad, about five-two.
The Toad looks around the corridor, eases the door closed.
TONY
(checking out the room)
Mind leaving the door open so my brothers know everything's okay... okay?
Toad shrugs and readjusts, leaving it open a few inches,
the conversation clipped and nervous throughout the scene.
TOAD
Sure, no problem... This is Marta.
TONY
Hello, Marta.
She nods woodenly, stays across the room. Behind her, the
television set is on to the Cable Newswatch. The protagonists
intermittently flick their eyes to it, soothing the tension.
TOAD
I'm Hector...
Pause.
TONY
Yeah. I'm Tony. So Omar says you're okay.
TOAD
Yeah, Omar's okay.
TONY
You know Omar.
TOAD
Omar, yeah, I talk to him on the phone.
TONY
Okay...
TOAD
Okay... so you got the money?
TONY
Yeah, you got the stuff?
TOAD
Sure I got the stuff, but I don't
got it right here with me. I got it
close by.

I know where you‚Äôve been
Don‚Äôt try to act like I don‚Äôt know you
And all the words you don‚Äôt hear
They always find a way back to you now
Say a new day has dawned, but we no longer get to
'Cause I know the truth
The leaves are all gone, so who‚Äôs moving on?
I know the worst is to come

On that Halloween you told me
You weren‚Äôt drinkin', I believed you
Now the only time I have‚Äôs to
Sit and wonder if you‚Äôre thinkin'
About the fun you‚Äôve had with someone else
I know the truth is wasted on you

I know what you wanted
Under the lies, you take ‚Äòem and find a way
To run out the door now
Back to a time that you tried to forget
Why‚Äôs the music so loud? Take it to the lawn now
Did you think about me if I ever were to find out?
Can you ease the pain with drinkin‚Äô all night?

Margaret was ready long before the appointed time, and had leisure enough to cry a little, quietly, when unobserved, and to smile brightly when any one looked at her. Her last alarm was lest they should be too late and miss the train; but no! they were all in time; and she breathed freely and happily at length, seated in the carriage opposite to Mr. Bell, and whirling away past the well-known stations; seeing the old south country-towns and hamlets sleeping in the warm light of the pure sun, which gave a yet ruddier colour to their tiled roofs, so different to the cold slates of the north. Broods of pigeons hovered around these peaked quaint gables, slowly settling here and there, and ruffling their soft, shiny feathers, as if exposing every fibre to the delicious warmth. There were few people about at the stations, it almost seemed as if they were too lazily content to wish to travel; none of the bustle and stir that Margaret had noticed in her two journeys on the London and North-Western line. Later on in the year, this line of railway should be stirring and alive with rich pleasure-seekers; but as to the constant going to and fro of busy trades-people it would always be widely different from the northern lines. Here a spectator or two stood lounging at nearly every station, with his hands in his pockets, so absorbed in the simple act of watching, that it made the travellers wonder what he could find to do when the train whirled away, and only the blank of a railway, some sheds, and a distant field or two were left for him to gaze upon. The hot air danced over the golden stillness of the land, farm after farm was left behind, each reminding Margaret of German Idyls‚Äîof Herman and Dorothea‚Äîof Evangeline. From this waking dream she was roused. It was the place to leave the train and take the fly to Helstone. And now sharper feelings came shooting through her heart, whether pain or pleasure she could hardly tell. Every mile was redolent of associations, which she would not have missed for the world, but each of which made her cry upon 'the days that are no more,' with ineffable longing. The last time she had passed along this road was when she had left it with her father and mother‚Äîthe day, the season, had been gloomy, and she herself hopeless, but they were there with her. Now she was alone, an orphan, and they, strangely, had gone away from her, and vanished from the face of the earth. It hurt her to see the Helstone road so flooded in the sun-light, and every turn and every familiar tree so precisely the same in its summer glory as it had been in former years. Nature felt no change, and was ever young.
Mr. Bell knew something of what would be passing through her mind, and wisely and kindly held his tongue. They drove up to the Lennard Arms; half farm-house, half-inn, standing a little apart from the road, as much as to say, that the host did not so depend on the custom of travellers, as to have to court it by any obtrusiveness; they, rather, must seek him out. The house fronted the village green; and right before it stood an immemorial lime-tree benched all round, in some hidden recesses of whose leafy wealth hung the grim escutcheon of the Lennards. The door of the inn stood wide open, but there was no hospitable hurry to receive the travellers. When the landlady did appear‚Äîand they might have abstracted many an article first‚Äîshe gave them a kind welcome, almost as if they had been invited guests, and apologised for her coming having been so delayed, by saying, that it was hay-time, and the provisions for the men had to be sent a-field, and she had been too busy packing up the baskets to hear the noise of wheels over the road, which, since they had left the highway, ran over soft short turf.
'Why, bless me!' exclaimed she, as at the end of her apology, a glint of sunlight showed her Margaret's face, hitherto unobserved in that shady parlour. 'It's Miss Hale, Jenny,' said she, running to the door, and calling to her daughter. 'Come here, come directly, it's Miss Hale!' And then she went up to Margaret, and shook her hands with motherly fondness.
'And how are you all? How's the Vicar and Miss Dixon? The Vicar above all! God bless him! We've never ceased to be sorry that he left.'
Margaret tried to speak and tell her of her father's death; of her mother's it was evident that Mrs. Purkis was aware, from her omission of her name. But she choked in the effort, and could only touch her deep mourning, and say the one word, 'Papa.'
'Surely, sir, it's never so!' said Mrs. Purkis, turning to Mr. Bell for confirmation of the sad suspicion that now entered her mind. 'There was a gentleman here in the spring‚Äîit might have been as long ago as last winter‚Äîwho told us a deal of Mr. Hale and Miss Margaret; and he said Mrs. Hale was gone, poor lady. But never a word of the Vicar's being ailing!'
'It is so, however,' said Mr. Bell. 'He died quite suddenly, when on a visit to me at Oxford. He was a good man, Mrs. Purkis, and there's many of us that might be thankful to have as calm an end as his. Come Margaret, my dear! Her father was my oldest friend, and she's my god-daughter, so I thought we would just come down together and see the old place; and I know of old you can give us comfortable rooms and a capital dinner. You don't remember me I see, but my name is Bell, and once or twice when the parsonage has been full, I've slept here, and tasted your good ale.'
'To be sure; I ask your pardon; but you see I was taken up with Miss Hale. Let me show you to a room, Miss Margaret, where you can take off your bonnet, and wash your face. It's only this very morning I plunged some fresh-gathered roses head downward in the water-jug, for, thought I, perhaps some one will be coming, and there's nothing so sweet as spring-water scented by a musk rose or two. To think of the Vicar being dead! Well, to be sure, we must all die; only that gentleman said, he was quite picking up after his trouble about Mrs. Hale's death.'
'Come down to me, Mrs. Purkis, after you have attended to Miss Hale. I want to have a consultation with you about dinner.'
The little casement window in Margaret's bed-chamber was almost filled up with rose and vine branches; but pushing them aside, and stretching a little out, she could see the tops of the parsonage chimneys above the trees; and distinguish many a well-known line through the leaves.
'Aye!' said Mrs. Purkis, smoothing down the bed, and despatching Jenny for an armful of lavender-scented towels, 'times is changed, miss; our new Vicar has seven children, and is building a nursery ready for more, just out where the arbour and tool-house used to be in old times. And he has had new grates put in, and a plate-glass window in the drawing-room. He and his wife are stirring people, and have done a deal of good; at least they say it's doing good; if it were not, I should call it turning things upside down for very little purpose. The new Vicar is a teetotaller, miss, and a magistrate, and his wife has a deal of receipts for economical cooking, and is for making bread without yeast; and they both talk so much, and both at a time, that they knock one down as it were, and it's not till they're gone, and one's a little at peace, that one can think that there were things one might have said on one's own side of the question. He'll be after the men's cans in the hay-field, and peeping in; and then there'll be an ado because it's not ginger beer, but I can't help it. My mother and my grandmother before me sent good malt liquor to haymakers; and took salts and senna when anything ailed them; and I must e'en go on in their ways, though Mrs. Hepworth does want to give me comfits instead of medicine, which, as she says, is a deal pleasanter, only I've no faith in it. But I must go, miss, though I'm wanting to hear many a thing; I'll come back to you before long.
Mr. Bell had strawberries and cream, a loaf of brown bread, and a jug of milk, (together with a Stilton cheese and a bottle of port for his own private refreshment,) ready for Margaret on her coming down stairs; and after this rustic luncheon they set out to walk, hardly knowing in what direction to turn, so many old familiar inducements were there in each.
'Shall we go past the vicarage?' asked Mr. Bell.
'No, not yet. We will go this way, and make a round so as to come back by it,' replied Margaret.
Here and there old trees had been felled the autumn before; or a squatter's roughly-built and decaying cottage had disappeared. Margaret missed them each and all, and grieved over them like old friends. They came past the spot where she and Mr. Lennox had sketched. The white, lightning-scarred trunk of the venerable beech, among whose roots they had sate down was there no more; the old man, the inhabitant of the ruinous cottage, was dead; the cottage had been pulled down, and a new one, tidy and respectable, had been built in its stead. There was a small garden on the place where the beech-tree had been.
'I did not think I had been so old,' said Margaret after a pause of silence; and she turned away sighing.
'Yes!' said Mr. Bell. 'It is the first changes among familiar things that make such a mystery of time to the young, afterwards we lose the sense of the mysterious. I take changes in all I see as a matter of course. The instability of all human things is familiar to me, to you it is new and oppressive.'
'Let us go on to see little Susan,' said Margaret, drawing her companion up a grassy road-way, leading under the shadow of a forest glade.
'With all my heart, though I have not an idea who little Susan may be. But I have a kindness for all Susans, for simple Susan's sake.'
'My little Susan was disappointed when I left without wishing her goodbye; and it has been on my conscience ever since, that I gave her pain which a little more exertion on my part might have prevented. But it is a long way. Are you sure you will not be tired?'
'Quite sure. That is, if you don't walk so fast. You see, here there are no views that can give one an excuse for stopping to take breath. You would think it romantic to be walking with a person ""fat and scant o' breath"" if I were Hamlet, Prince of Denmark. Have compassion on my infirmities for his sake.'
'I will walk slower for your own sake. I like you twenty times better than Hamlet.'
'On the principle that a living ass is better than a dead lion?'
'Perhaps so. I don't analyse my feelings.'
'I am content to take your liking me, without examining too curiously into the materials it is made of. Only we need not walk at a snail's' pace.'
'Very well. Walk at your own pace, and I will follow. Or stop still and meditate, like the Hamlet you compare yourself to, if I go too fast.'
'Thank you. But as my mother has not murdered my father, and afterwards married my uncle, I shouldn't know what to think about, unless it were balancing the chances of our having a well-cooked dinner or not. What do you think?'
'I am in good hopes. She used to be considered a famous cook as far as Helstone opinion went.'
'But have you considered the distraction of mind produced by all this haymaking?'
Margaret felt all Mr. Bell's kindness in trying to make cheerful talk about nothing, to endeavour to prevent her from thinking too curiously about the past. But she would rather have gone over these dear-loved walks in silence, if indeed she were not ungrateful enough to wish that she might have been alone.
They reached the cottage where Susan's widowed mother lived. Susan was not there. She was gone to the parochial school. Margaret was disappointed, and the poor woman saw it, and began to make a kind of apology.
'Oh! it is quite right,' said Margaret. 'I am very glad to hear it. I might have thought of it. Only she used to stop at home with you.'
'Yes, she did; and I miss her sadly. I used to teach her what little I knew at nights. It were not much to be sure. But she were getting such a handy girl, that I miss her sore. But she's a deal above me in learning now.' And the mother sighed.
'I'm all wrong,' growled Mr. Bell. 'Don't mind what I say. I'm a hundred years behind the world. But I should say, that the child was getting a better and simpler, and more natural education stopping at home, and helping her mother, and learning to read a chapter in the New Testament every night by her side, than from all the schooling under the sun.'
Margaret did not want to encourage him to go on by replying to him, and so prolonging the discussion before the mother. So she turned to her and asked,
'How is old Betty Barnes?'
'I don't know,' said the woman rather shortly. 'We'se not friends.'
'Why not?' asked Margaret, who had formerly been the peacemaker of the village.
'She stole my cat.'
'Did she know it was yours?'
'I don't know. I reckon not.'
'Well! could not you get it back again when you told her it was yours?'
'No! for she'd burnt it.'
'Burnt it!' exclaimed both Margaret and Mr. Bell.
'Roasted it!' explained the woman.
It was no explanation. By dint of questioning, Margaret extracted from her the horrible fact that Betty Barnes, having been induced by a gypsy fortune-teller to lend the latter her husband's Sunday clothes, on promise of having them faithfully returned on the Saturday night before Goodman Barnes should have missed them, became alarmed by their non-appearance, and her consequent dread of her husband's anger, and as, according to one of the savage country superstitions, the cries of a cat, in the agonies of being boiled or roasted alive, compelled (as it were) the powers of darkness to fulfil the wishes of the executioner, resort had been had to the charm. The poor woman evidently believed in its efficacy; her only feeling was indignation that her cat had been chosen out from all others for a sacrifice. Margaret listened in horror; and endeavoured in vain to enlighten the woman's mind; but she was obliged to give it up in despair. Step by step she got the woman to admit certain facts, of which the logical connexion and sequence was perfectly clear to Margaret; but at the end, the bewildered woman simply repeated her first assertion, namely, that 'it were very cruel for sure, and she should not like to do it; but that there were nothing like it for giving a person what they wished for; she had heard it all her life; but it were very cruel for all that.' Margaret gave it up in despair, and walked away sick at heart.
'You are a good girl not to triumph over me,' said Mr. Bell.
'How? What do you mean?'
'I own, I am wrong about schooling. Anything rather than have that child brought up in such practical paganism.'
'Oh! I remember. Poor little Susan! I must go and see her; would you mind calling at the school?'
'Not a bit. I am curious to see something of the teaching she is to receive.'
They did not speak much more, but thridded their way through many a bosky dell, whose soft green influence could not charm away the shock and the pain in Margaret's heart, caused by the recital of such cruelty; a recital too, the manner of which betrayed such utter want of imagination, and therefore of any sympathy with the suffering animal.
The buzz of voices, like the murmur of a hive of busy human bees, made itself heard as soon as they emerged from the forest on the more open village-green on which the school was situated. The door was wide open, and they entered. A brisk lady in black, here, there, and everywhere, perceived them, and bade them welcome with somewhat of the hostess-air which, Margaret remembered, her mother was won't to assume, only in a more soft and languid manner, when any rare visitors strayed in to inspect the school. She knew at once it was the present Vicar's wife, her mother's successor; and she would have drawn back from the interview had it been possible; but in an instant she had conquered this feeling, and modestly advanced, meeting many a bright glance of recognition, and hearing many a half-suppressed murmur of 'It's Miss Hale.' The Vicar's lady heard the name, and her manner at once became more kindly. Margaret wished she could have helped feeling that it also became more patronising. The lady held out a hand to Mr. Bell, with‚Äî
'Your father, I presume, Miss Hale. I see it by the likeness. I am sure I am very glad to see you, sir, and so will the Vicar be.'
Margaret explained that it was not her father, and stammered out the fact of his death; wondering all the time how Mr. Hale could have borne coming to revisit Helstone, if it had been as the Vicar's lady supposed. She did not hear what Mrs. Hepworth was saying, and left it to Mr. Bell to reply, looking round, meanwhile, for her old acquaintances.
'Ah! I see you would like to take a class, Miss Hale. I know it by myself. First class stand up for a parsing lesson with Miss Hale.'
Poor Margaret, whose visit was sentimental, not in any degree inspective, felt herself taken in; but as in some way bringing her in contact with little eager faces, once well-known, and who had received the solemn rite of baptism from her father, she sate down, half losing herself in tracing out the changing features of the girls, and holding Susan's hand for a minute or two, unobserved by all, while the first class sought for their books, and the Vicar's lady went as near as a lady could towards holding Mr. Bell by the button, while she explained the Phonetic system to him, and gave him a conversation she had had with the Inspector about it.
Margaret bent over her book, and seeing nothing but that‚Äîhearing the buzz of children's voices, old times rose up, and she thought of them, and her eyes filled with tears, till all at once there was a pause‚Äîone of the girls was stumbling over the apparently simple word 'a,' uncertain what to call it.
'A, an indefinite article,' said Margaret, mildly.
'I beg your pardon,' said the Vicar's wife, all eyes and ears; 'but we are taught by Mr. Milsome to call ""a"" an‚Äîwho can remember?'
'An adjective absolute,' said half-a-dozen voices at once. And Margaret sate abashed. The children knew more than she did. Mr. Bell turned away, and smiled.
Margaret spoke no more during the lesson. But after it was over, she went quietly round to one or two old favourites, and talked to them a little. They were growing out of children into great girls; passing out of her recollection in their rapid development, as she, by her three years' absence, was vanishing from theirs. Still she was glad to have seen them all again, though a tinge of sadness mixed itself with her pleasure. When school was over for the day, it was yet early in the summer afternoon; and Mrs. Hepworth proposed to Margaret that she and Mr. Bell should accompany her to the parsonage, and see the‚Äîthe word 'improvements' had half slipped out of her mouth, but she substituted the more cautious term 'alterations' which the present Vicar was making. Margaret did not care a straw about seeing the alterations, which jarred upon her fond recollection of what her home had been; but she longed to see the old place once more, even though she shivered away from the pain which she knew she should feel.
The parsonage was so altered, both inside and out, that the real pain was less than she had anticipated. It was not like the same place. The garden, the grass-plat, formerly so daintily trim that even a stray rose-leaf seemed like a fleck on its exquisite arrangement and propriety, was strewed with children's things; a bag of marbles here, a hoop there; a straw-hat forced down upon a rose-tree as on a peg, to the destruction of a long beautiful tender branch laden with flowers, which in former days would have been trained up tenderly, as if beloved. The little square matted hall was equally filled with signs of merry healthy rough childhood.
'Ah!' said Mrs. Hepworth, 'you must excuse this untidiness, Miss Hale. When the nursery is finished, I shall insist upon a little order. We are building a nursery out of your room, I believe. How did you manage, Miss Hale, without a nursery?'
'We were but two,' said Margaret. 'You have many children, I presume?'
'Seven. Look here! we are throwing out a window to the road on this side. Mr. Hepworth is spending an immense deal of money on this house; but really it was scarcely habitable when we came‚Äîfor so large a family as ours I mean, of course.' Every room in the house was changed, besides the one of which Mrs. Hepworth spoke, which had been Mr. Hale's study formerly; and where the green gloom and delicious quiet of the place had conduced, as he had said, to a habit of meditation, but, perhaps, in some degree to the formation of a character more fitted for thought than action. The new window gave a view of the road, and had many advantages, as Mrs. Hepworth pointed out. From it the wandering sheep of her husband's flock might be seen, who straggled to the tempting beer-house, unobserved as they might hope, but not unobserved in reality; for the active Vicar kept his eye on the road, even during the composition of his most orthodox sermons, and had a hat and stick hanging ready at hand to seize, before sallying out after his parishioners, who had need of quick legs if they could take refuge in the 'Jolly Forester' before the teetotal Vicar had arrested them. The whole family were quick, brisk, loud-talking, kind-hearted, and not troubled with much delicacy of perception. Margaret feared that Mrs. Hepworth would find out that Mr. Bell was playing upon her, in the admiration he thought fit to express for everything that especially grated on his taste. But no! she took it all literally, and with such good faith, that Margaret could not help remonstrating with him as they walked slowly away from the parsonage back to their inn.
'Don't scold, Margaret. It was all because of you. If she had not shown you every change with such evident exultation in their superior sense, in perceiving what an improvement this and that would be, I could have behaved well. But if you must go on preaching, keep it till after dinner, when it will send me to sleep, and help my digestion.'
They were both of them tired, and Margaret herself so much so, that she was unwilling to go out as she had proposed to do, and have another ramble among the woods and fields so close to the home of her childhood. And, somehow, this visit to Helstone had not been all‚Äîhad not been exactly what she had expected. There was change everywhere; slight, yet pervading all. Households were changed by absence, or death, or marriage, or the natural mutations brought by days and months and years, which carry us on imperceptibly from childhood to youth, and thence through manhood to age, whence we drop like fruit, fully ripe, into the quiet mother earth. Places were changed‚Äîa tree gone here, a bough there, bringing in a long ray of light where no light was before‚Äîa road was trimmed and narrowed, and the green straggling pathway by its side enclosed and cultivated. A great improvement it was called; but Margaret sighed over the old picturesqueness, the old gloom, and the grassy wayside of former days. She sate by the window on the little settle, sadly gazing out upon the gathering shades of night, which harmonised well with her pensive thought. Mr. Bell slept soundly, after his unusual exercise through the day. At last he was roused by the entrance of the tea-tray, brought in by a flushed-looking country-girl, who had evidently been finding some variety from her usual occupation of waiter, in assisting this day in the hayfield.
'Hallo! Who's there! Where are we? Who's that,‚ÄîMargaret? Oh, now I remember all. I could not imagine what woman was sitting there in such a doleful attitude, with her hands clasped straight out upon her knees, and her face looking so steadfastly before her. What were you looking at?' asked Mr. Bell, coming to the window, and standing behind Margaret.
'Nothing,' said she, rising up quickly, and speaking as cheerfully as she could at a moment's notice.
'Nothing indeed! A bleak back-ground of trees, some white linen hung out on the sweet-briar hedge, and a great waft of damp air. Shut the window, and come in and make tea.'
Margaret was silent for some time. She played with her teaspoon, and did not attend particularly to what Mr. Bell said. He contradicted her, and she took the same sort of smiling notice of his opinion as if he had agreed with her. Then she sighed, and putting down her spoon, she began, apropos of nothing at all, and in the high-pitched voice which usually shows that the speaker has been thinking for some time on the subject that they wish to introduce‚Äî'Mr. Bell, you remember what we were saying about Frederick last night, don't you?'
'Last night. Where was I? Oh, I remember! Why it seems a week ago. Yes, to be sure, I recollect we talked about him, poor fellow.'
'Yes‚Äîand do you not remember that Mr. Lennox spoke about his having been in England about the time of dear mamma's death?' asked Margaret, her voice now lower than usual.
'I recollect. I hadn't heard of it before.'
'And I thought‚ÄîI always thought that papa had told you about it.'
'No! he never did. But what about it, Margaret?'
'I want to tell you of something I did that was very wrong, about that time,' said Margaret, suddenly looking up at him with her clear honest eyes. 'I told a lie;' and her face became scarlet.
'True, that was bad I own; not but what I have told a pretty round number in my life, not all in downright words, as I suppose you did, but in actions, or in some shabby circumlocutory way, leading people either to disbelieve the truth, or believe a falsehood. You know who is the father of lies, Margaret? Well! a great number of folk, thinking themselves very good, have odd sorts of connexion with lies, left-hand marriages, and second cousins-once-removed. The tainting blood of falsehood runs through us all. I should have guessed you as far from it as most people. What! crying, child? Nay, now we'll not talk of it, if it ends in this way. I dare say you have been sorry for it, and that you won't do it again, and it's long ago now, and in short I want you to be very cheerful, and not very sad, this evening.'
Margaret wiped her eyes, and tried to talk about something else, but suddenly she burst out afresh.
'Please, Mr. Bell, let me tell you about it‚Äîyou could perhaps help me a little; no, not help me, but if you knew the truth, perhaps you could put me to rights‚Äîthat is not it, after all,' said she, in despair at not being able to express herself more exactly as she wished.
Mr. Bell's whole manner changed. 'Tell me all about it, child,' said he.
'It's a long story; but when Fred came, mamma was very ill, and I was undone with anxiety, and afraid, too, that I might have drawn him into danger; and we had an alarm just after her death, for Dixon met some one in Milton‚Äîa man called Leonards‚Äîwho had known Fred, and who seemed to owe him a grudge, or at any rate to be tempted by the recollection of the reward offered for his apprehension; and with this new fright, I thought I had better hurry off Fred to London, where, as you would understand from what we said the other night, he was to go to consult Mr. Lennox as to his chances if he stood the trial. So we‚Äîthat is, he and I,‚Äîwent to the railway station; it was one evening, and it was just getting rather dusk, but still light enough to recognise and be recognised, and we were too early, and went out to walk in a field just close by; I was always in a panic about this Leonards, who was, I knew, somewhere in the neighbourhood; and then, when we were in the field, the low red sunlight just in my face, some one came by on horseback in the road just below the field-style by which we stood. I saw him look at me, but I did not know who it was at first, the sun was so in my eyes, but in an instant the dazzle went off, and I saw it was Mr. Thornton, and we bowed,'‚Äî‚Äî
'And he saw Frederick of course,' said Mr. Bell, helping her on with her story, as he thought.
'Yes; and then at the station a man came up‚Äîtipsy and reeling‚Äîand he tried to collar Fred, and over-balanced himself as Fred wrenched himself away, and fell over the edge of the platform; not far, not deep; not above three feet; but oh! Mr. Bell, somehow that fall killed him!'
'How awkward. It was this Leonards, I suppose. And how did Fred get off?'
'Oh! he went off immediately after the fall, which we never thought could have done the poor fellow any harm, it seemed so slight an injury.'
'Then he did not die directly?'
'No! not for two or three days. And then‚Äîoh, Mr. Bell! now comes the bad part,' said she, nervously twining her fingers together. 'A police inspector came and taxed me with having been the companion of the young man, whose push or blow had occasioned Leonards' death; that was a false accusation, you know, but we had not heard that Fred had sailed, he might still be in London and liable to be arrested on this false charge, and his identity with the Lieutenant Hale, accused of causing that mutiny, discovered, he might be shot; all this flashed through my mind, and I said it was not me. I was not at the railway station that night. I knew nothing about it. I had no conscience or thought but to save Frederick.'
'I say it was right. I should have done the same. You forgot yourself in thought for another. I hope I should have done the same.'
'No, you would not. It was wrong, disobedient, faithless. At that very time Fred was safely out of England, and in my blindness I forgot that there was another witness who could testify to my being there.'
'Who?'
'Mr. Thornton. You know he had seen me close to the station; we had bowed to each other.'
'Well! he would know nothing of this riot about the drunken fellow's death. I suppose the inquiry never came to anything.'
'No! the proceedings they had begun to talk about on the inquest were stopped. Mr. Thornton did know all about it. He was a magistrate, and he found out that it was not the fall that had caused the death. But not before he knew what I had said. Oh, Mr. Bell!' She suddenly covered her face with her hands, as if wishing to hide herself from the presence of the recollection.
'Did you have any explanation with him? Did you ever tell him the strong, instinctive motive?'
'The instinctive want of faith, and clutching at a sin to keep myself from sinking,' said she bitterly. 'No! How could I? He knew nothing of Frederick. To put myself to rights in his good opinion, was I to tell him of the secrets of our family, involving, as they seemed to do, the chances of poor Frederick's entire exculpation? Fred's last words had been to enjoin me to keep his visit a secret from all. You see, papa never told, even you. No! I could bear the shame‚ÄîI thought I could at least. I did bear it. Mr. Thornton has never respected me since.'
'He respects you, I am sure,' said Mr. Bell. 'To be sure, it accounts a little for‚Äî‚Äî. But he always speaks of you with regard and esteem, though now I understand certain reservations in his manner.'
Margaret did not speak; did not attend to what Mr. Bell went on to say; lost all sense of it. By-and-by she said:
'Will you tell me what you refer to about ""reservations"" in his manner of speaking of me?'
'Oh! simply he has annoyed me by not joining in my praises of you. Like an old fool, I thought that every one would have the same opinions as I had; and he evidently could not agree with me. I was puzzled at the time. But he must be perplexed, if the affair has never been in the least explained. There was first your walking out with a young man in the dark‚Äî'
'But it was my brother!' said Margaret, surprised.
'True. But how was he to know that?'
'I don't know. I never thought of anything of that kind,' said Margaret, reddening, and looking hurt and offended.
'And perhaps he never would, but for the lie,‚Äîwhich, under the circumstances, I maintain, was necessary.'
'It was not. I know it now. I bitterly repent it.'
There was a long pause of silence. Margaret was the first to speak.
'I am not likely ever to see Mr. Thornton again,'‚Äîand there she stopped.
'There are many things more unlikely, I should say,' replied Mr. Bell.
'But I believe I never shall. Still, somehow one does not like to have sunk so low in‚Äîin a friend's opinion as I have done in his.' Her eyes were full of tears, but her",en,LABEL_0,0.5114735960960388,LABEL_1,0.48852643370628357

the palace there are statues of the gods, and altars prepared for
sacrifice. It is night. On the roof of the palace can be
discerned a WATCHMAN.)
A WATCHMAN
I pray the gods to quit me of my toils,
To close the watch I keep, this livelong year;
For as a watch-dog lying, not at rest,
Propped on one arm, upon the palace-roof
Of Atreus' race, too long, too well I know
The starry conclave of the midnight sky,
Too well, the splendours of the firmament,
The lords of light, whose kingly aspect shows--
What time they set or climb the sky in turn--
The year's divisions, bringing frost or fire.
And now, as ever, am I set to mark
When shall stream up the glow of signal-flame,
The bale-fire bright, and tell its Trojan tale--
""Troy town is ta'en:"" such issue holds in hope
She in whose woman's breast beats heart of man.
Thus upon mine unrestful couch I lie,
Bathed with the dews of night, unvisited
By dreams--ah me!--for in the place of sleep
Stands Fear as my familiar, and repels
The soft repose that would mine eyelids seal.
And if at whiles, for the lost balm of sleep,
I medicine my soul with melody
Of trill or song--anon to tears I turn,
Wailing the woe that broods upon this home,
Not now by honour guided as of old.
But now at last fair fall the welcome hour
That sets me free, whene'er the thick night glow
With beacon-fire of hope deferred no more.
All hail!
A beacon-light is seen reddening the distant sky.
Fire of the night, that brings my spirit day,
Shedding on Argos light, and dance, and song,
Greetings to fortune, hail!
Let my loud summons ring within the ears
Of AGAMEMNON's queen, that she anon
Start from her couch and with a shrill voice cry
A joyous welcome to the beacon-blaze,
For Ilion's fall; such fiery message gleams
From yon high flame; and I, before the rest,
Will foot the lightsome measure of our joy;
For I can say, ""My master's dice fell fair--
Behold! the triple sice, the lucky flame!""
Now be my lot to clasp, in loyal love,
The hand of him restored, who rules our home:
Home--but I say no more: upon my tongue
Treads hard the ox o' the adage.
Had it voice,
The home itself might soothliest tell its tale;
I, of set will, speak words the wise may learn,
To others, nought remember nor discern.
Exit. The CHORUS of old men of Mycenae enter, each leaning on a staff.
During their song CLYTEMNESTRA appears in the background, kindling the altars.
CHORUS
Ten livelong years have rolled away,
Since the twin lords of sceptred sway,
By Zeus endowed with pride of place,
The doughty chiefs of Atreus' race,
Went forth of yore,
To plead with Priam, face to face,
Before the judgment-seat of War!
A thousand ships from Argive land
Put forth to bear the martial band,
That with a spirit stern and strong
Went out to right the kingdom's wrong--
Pealed, as they went, the battle-song,
Wild as the vultures' cry;
When o'er the eyrie, soaring high,
In wild bereav√®d agony,
Around, around, in airy rings,
They wheel with oarage of their wings,
But not the eyas-brood behold,
That called them to the nest of old;
But let Apollo from the sky,
Or Pan, or Zeus, but hear the cry,
The exile cry, the wail forlorn,
Of birds from whom their home is torn--
On those who wrought the rapine fell,
Heaven sends the vengeful fiends of hell.
Even so doth Zeus, the jealous lord
And guardian of the hearth and board,
Speed Atreus' sons, in vengeful ire,
'Gainst Paris--sends them forth on fire,
Her to buy back, in war and blood,
Whom one did wed but many woo'd!
And many, many, by his will,
The last embrace of foes shall feel,
And many a knee in dust be bowed,
And splintered spears on shields ring loud,
Of Trojan and of Greek, before
That iron bridal-feast be o'er!
But as he willed 'tis ordered all,
And woes, by heaven ordained, must fall--
Unsoothed by tears or spilth of wine
Poured forth too late, the wrath divine
Glares vengeance on the flameless shrine.
And we in gray dishonoured eld,
Feeble of frame, unfit were held
To join the warrior array
That then went forth unto the fray:
And here at home we tarry, fain
Our feeble footsteps to sustain,
Each on his staff--so strength doth wane,
And turns to childishness again.
For while the sap of youth is green,
And, yet unripened, leaps within,
The young are weakly as the old,
And each alike unmeet to hold
The vantage post of war!
And ah! when flower and fruit are o'er,
And on life's tree the leaves are sere,
Age wendeth propped its journey drear,
As forceless as a child, as light
And fleeting as a dream of night
Lost in the garish day!
But thou, O child of Tyndareus,
Queen CLYTEMNESTRA, speak! and say
What messenger of joy to-day
Hath won thine ear? what welcome news,
That thus in sacrificial wise
E'en to the city's boundaries
Thou biddest altar-fires arise?
Each god who doth our city guard,
And keeps o'er Argos watch and ward
From heaven above, from earth below--
The mighty lords who rule the skies,
The market's lesser deities,
To each and all the altars glow,
Piled for the sacrifice!
And here and there, anear, afar,
Streams skyward many a beacon-star,
Conjur'd and charm'd and kindled well
By pure oil's soft and guileless spell,
Hid now no more
Within the palace' secret store.
O queen, we pray thee, whatsoe'er,
Known unto thee, were well revealed,
That thou wilt trust it to our ear,
And bid our anxious heart be healed!
That waneth now unto despair--
Now, waxing to a presage fair,
Dawns, from the altar, Hope--to scare
From our rent hearts the vulture Care.
List! for the power is mine, to chant on high
The chiefs' emprise, the strength that omens gave!
List! on my soul breathes yet a harmony,
From realms of ageless powers, and strong to save!
How brother kings, twin lords of one command,
Led forth the youth of Hellas in their flower,
Urged on their way, with vengeful spear and brand,
By warrior-birds, that watched the parting hour.
""Go forth to Troy"", the eagles seemed to cry--
And the sea-kings obeyed the sky-kings' word,
When on the right they soared across the sky,
And one was black, one bore a white tail barred.
High o'er the palace were they seen to soar,
Then lit in sight of all, and rent and tare,
Far from the fields that she should range no more,
Big with her unborn brood, a mother-hare.
And one beheld, the soldier-prophet true,
And the two chiefs, unlike of soul and will,
In the twy-coloured eagles straight he knew,
And spake the omen forth, for good and ill.
(Ah woe and well-a-day! but be the issue fair!)
""Go forth,"" he cried, ""and Priam's town shall fall.
Yet long the time shall be; and flock and herd,
The people's wealth, that roam before the wall.
Shall force hew down, when Fate shall give the word.
But O beware! lest wrath in Heaven abide,
To dim the glowing battle-forge once more,
And mar the mighty curb of Trojan pride,
The steel of vengeance, welded as for war!
For virgin Artemis bears jealous hate
Against the royal house, the eagle-pair,
Who rend the unborn brood, insatiate--
Yea, loathes their banquet on the quivering hare.""
(Ah woe and well-a-day! but be the issue fair!)
""For well she loves--the goddess kind and mild--
The tender new-born cubs of lions bold,
Too weak to range--and well the sucking child
Of every beast that roams by wood and wold.
So to the Lord of Heaven she prayeth still,
""Nay. if it must be, be the omen true!
Yet do the visioned eagles presage ill;
The end be well, but crossed with evil too!""
Healer Apollo! be her wrath controll'd,
Nor weave the long delay of thwarting gales,
To war against the Danaans and withhold
From the free ocean-waves their eager sails!
She craves, alas! to see a second life
Shed forth, a curst unhallowed sacrifice--
'Twixt wedded souls, artificer of strife,
And hate that knows not fear, and fell device.
At home there tarries like a lurking snake,
Biding its time, a wrath unreconciled,""
""A wily watcher, passionate to slake,
In blood, resentment for a murdered child.""
Such was the mighty warning, pealed of yore--
Amid good tidings, such the word of fear,
What time the fateful eagles hovered o'er
The kings, and Calchas read the omen clear.
(In strains like his, once more,
Sing woe and well-a-day! but be the issue fair!)
Zeus--if to The Unknown
That name of many names seem good--
Zeus, upon Thee I call.
Thro' the mind's every road
I passed, but vain are all,
Save that which names thee Zeus, the Highest One,
Were it but mine to cast away the load,
The weary load, that weighs my spirit down.
He that was Lord of old,
In full-blown pride of place and valour bold,
Hath fallen and is gone, even as an old tale told!
And he that next held sway,
By stronger grasp o'erthrown
Hath pass'd away!
And whoso now shall bid the triumph-chant arise
To Zeus, and Zeus alone,
He shall be found the truly wise.
'Tis Zeus alone who shows the perfect way
Of knowledge: He hath ruled,
Men shall learn wisdom, by affliction schooled.
In visions of the night, like dropping rain,
Descend the many memories of pain
Before the spirit's sight: through tears and dole
Comes wisdom o'er the unwilling soul--
A boon, I wot, of all Divinity,
That holds its sacred throne in strength, above the sky!
And then the elder chief, at whose command
The fleet of Greece was manned,
Cast on the seer no word of hate,
But veered before the sudden breath of Fate--
Ah, weary while! for, ere they put forth sail,
Did every store, each minish'd vessel, fail,
While all the Achaean host
At Aulis anchored lay,
Looking across to Chalics and the coast
Where refluent waters welter, rock, and sway;
And rife with ill delay
From northern Strymon blew the thwarting blast--
Mother of famine fell,
That holds men wand'ring still
Far from the haven where they fain would be!--
And pitiless did waste
Each ship and cable, rotting on the sea,
And, doubling with delay each weary hour,
Withered with hope deferred th' Achaeans' warlike flower.
But when, for bitter storm, a deadlier relief,
And heavier with ill to either chief,
Pleading the ire of Artemis, the seer avowed,
The two Atridae smote their sceptres on the plain,
And, striving hard, could not their tears restrain!
And then the elder monarch spake aloud--
""Ill lot were mine, to disobey!
And ill, to smite my child, my household's love and pride!
To stain with virgin Hood a father's hands, and slay
My daughter, by the altar's side!
Twixt woe and woe I dwell--
I dare not like a recreant fly,
And leave the league of ships, and fail each true ally;
For rightfully they crave, with eager fiery mind,
The virgin's blood, shed forth to lull the adverse wind--
God send the deed be well!""
Thus on his neck he took
Fate's hard compelling yoke;
Then, in the counter-gale of will abhorr'd, accursed,
To recklessness his shifting spirit veered--
Alas! that Frenzy, first of ills and worst,
With evil craft men's souls to sin hath ever stirred!
And so he steeled his heart--ah, well-a-day--
Aiding a war for one false woman's sake,
His child to slay,
And with her spilt blood make
An offering, to speed the ships upon their way!
Lusting for war, the bloody arbiters
Closed heart and ears, and would nor hear nor heed
The girl-voice plead,
""Pity me, Father!"" nor her prayers,
Nor tender, virgin years.
So, when the chant of sacrifice was done,
Her father bade the youthful priestly train
Raise her, like some poor kid, above the altar-stone,
From where amid her robes she lay
Sunk all in swoon away--
Bade them, as with the bit that mutely tames the steed,
Her fair lips' speech refrain,
Lest she should speak a curse on Atreus' home and seed,
So, trailing on the earth her robe of saffron dye,
With one last piteous dart from her beseeching eye
Those that should smite she smote--
Fair, silent, as a pictur'd form, but fain
To plead, ""Is all forgot?
How oft those halls of old,
Wherein my sire high feast did hold,""
""Rang to the virginal soft strain,
When I, a stainless child,
Sang from pure lips and undefiled,
Sang of my sire, and all
His honoured life, and how on him should fall
Heaven's highest gift and gain!""
And then--but I beheld not, nor can tell,
What further fate befel:
But this is sure, that Calchas' boding strain
Can ne'er be void or vain.
This wage from Justice' hand do sufferers earn,
The future to discern:
And yet--farewell, O secret of To-morrow!
Fore-knowledge is fore-sorrow.
Clear with the clear beams of the morrow's sun,
The future presseth on.
Now, let the house's tale, how dark soe'er,
Find yet an issue fair!--
So prays the loyal, solitary band
That guards the Apian land.
They turn to CLYTEMNESTRA, who leaves the altars and comes forward.
O queen, I come in reverence of thy sway--
For, while the ruler's kingly seat is void,
The loyal heart before his consort bends.
Now--be it sure and certain news of good,
Or the fair tidings of a flatt'ring hope,
That bids thee spread the light from shrine to shrine,
I, fain to hear, yet grudge not if thou hide.
CLYTEMNESTRA
As saith the adage, ""From the womb of Night
Spring forth, with promise fair, the young child Light.""
Ay--fairer even than all hope my news--
By Grecian hands is Priam's city ta'en!
CHORUS
What say'st thou? doubtful heart makes treach'rous ear.
CLYTEMNESTRA
Hear then again, and plainly--Troy is ours!
CHORUS
Thrills thro' my heart such joy as wakens tears.
CLYTEMNESTRA
Ay, thro' those tears thine eye looks loyalty.
CHORUS
But hast thou proof, to make assurance sure?
CLYTEMNESTRA
Go to; I have--unless the god has lied.
CHORUS
Hath some night-vision won thee to belief?
CLYTEMNESTRA
Out on all presage of a slumb'rous soul!
CHORUS
But wert thou cheered by Rumour's wingless word?
CLYTEMNESTRA
Peace--thou dost chide me as a credulous girl.
CHORUS
Say then, how long ago the city fell?
CLYTEMNESTRA
Even in this night that now brings forth the dawn.
CHORUS
Yet who so swift could speed the message here?
CLYTEMNESTRA
From Ida's top Hephaestus, lord of fire,
Sent forth his sign; and on, and ever on,
Beacon to beacon sped the courier-flame.
From Ida to the crag, that Hermes loves,
Of Lemnos; thence unto the steep sublime
Of Athos, throne of Zeus, the broad blaze flared.
Thence, raised aloft to shoot across the sea,
The moving light, rejoicing in its strength,
Sped from the pyre of pine, and urged its way,
In golden glory, like some strange new sun,
Onward, and reached Macistus' watching heights.
There, with no dull delay nor heedless sleep,
The watcher sped the tidings on in turn,
Until the guard upon Messapius' peak
Saw the far flame gleam on Euripus' tide,
And from the high-piled heap of withered furze
Lit the new sign and bade the message on.
Then the strong light, far flown and yet undimmed,
Shot thro' the sky above Asopus' plain,
Bright as the moon, and on Cithaeron's crag
Aroused Anotherwatch of flying fire.
And there the sentinels no whit disowned,
But sent redoubled on, the hest of flame--
Swift shot the light, above Gorgopis' bay,
To Aegiplanctus' mount, and bade the peak
Fail not the onward ordinance of fire.
And like a long beard streaming in the wind,
Full-fed with fuel, roared and rose the blaze,
And onward flaring, gleamed above the cape,
Beneath which shimmers the Saronic bay,
And thence leapt light unto Arachne's peak,
The mountain watch that looks upon our town.
Thence to th' Atrides' roof--in lineage fair,
A bright posterity of Ida's fire.
So sped from stage to stage, fulfilled in turn,
Flame after flame, along the course ordained,
And lo! the last to speed upon its way
Sights the end first, and glows unto the goal.
And Troy is ta'en, and by this sign my lord
Tells me the tale, and ye have learned my word.
CHORUS
To heaven, O queen, will I upraise new song:
But, wouldst thou speak once more, I fain would hear
From first to last the marvel of the tale.
CLYTEMNESTRA
Think you--this very morn--the Greeks in Troy,
And loud therein the voice of utter wail!
Within one cup pour vinegar and oil,
And look! unblent, unreconciled, they war.
So in the twofold issue of the strife
Mingle the victor's shout, the captives' moan.
For all the conquered whom the sword has spared
Cling weeping--some unto a brother slain,
Some childlike to a nursing father's form,
And wail the loved and lost, the while their neck
Bows down already 'neath the captive's chain.
And lo! the victors, now the fight is done,
Goaded by restless hunger, far and wide
Range all disordered thro' the town, to snatch
Such victual and such rest as chance may give
Within the captive halls that once were Troy--
Joyful to rid them of the frost and dew,
Wherein they couched upon the plain of old--
Joyful to sleep the gracious night all through,
Unsummoned of the watching sentinel.
Yet let them reverence well the city's gods,
The lords of Troy, tho' fallen, and her shrines;
So shall the spoilers not in turn be spoiled.
Yea, let no craving for forbidden gain
Bid conquerors yield before the darts of greed.
For we need yet, before the race be won,
Homewards, unharmed, to round the course once more.
For should the host wax wanton ere it come,
Then, tho' the sudden blow of fate be spared,
Yet in the sight of gods shall rise once more
The great wrong of the slain, to claim revenge.
Now, hearing from this woman's mouth of mine,
The tale and eke its warning, pray with me,
""Luck sway the scale, with no uncertain poise.
For my fair hopes are changed to fairer joys.""
CHORUS
A gracious word thy woman's lips have told,
Worthy a wise man's utterance, O my queen;
Now with clear trust in thy convincing tale
I set me to salute the gods with song,
Who bring us bliss to counterpoise our pain.
Exit CLYTEMNESTRA.
Zeus, Lord of heaven! and welcome night
Of victory, that hast our might
With all the glories crowned!
On towers of Ilion, free no more,
Hast flung the mighty mesh of war,
And closely girt them round,
Till neither warrior may 'scape,
Nor stripling lightly overleap
The trammels as they close, and close,
Till with the grip of doom our foes
In slavery's coil are bound!
Zeus, Lord of hospitality,
In grateful awe I bend to thee--
Tis thou hast struck the blow!
At Alexander, long ago,
We marked thee bend thy vengeful bow,
But long and warily withhold
The eager shaft, which, uncontrolled
And loosed too soon or launched too high,
Had wandered bloodless through the sky.
Zeus, the high God!--whate'er be dim in doubt,
This can our thought track out--
The blow that fells the sinner is of God,
And as he wills, the rod
Of vengeance smiteth sore.One said of old,
""The gods list not to hold
A reckoning with him whose feet oppress
The grace of holiness--""
An impious word! for whensoe'er the sire
Breathed forth rebellious fire--
What time his household overflowed the measure
Of bliss and health and treasure--
His children's children read the reckoning plain,
At last, in tears and pain.
On me let weal that brings no woe be sent,
And therewithal, content!
Who spurns the shrine of Right, nor wealth nor power
Shall be to him a tower,
To guard him from the gulf: there lies his lot,
Where all things are forgot.
Lust drives him on--lust, desperate and wild,
Fate's sin-contriving child--
And cure is none; beyond concealment clear,
Kindles sin's baleful glare.
As an ill coin beneath the wearing touch
Betrays by stain and smutch
Its metal false--such is the sinful wight.
Before, on pinions light,
Fair Pleasure flits, and lures him childlike on,
While home and kin make moan
Beneath the grinding burden of his crime;
Till, in the end of time,
Cast down of heaven, he pours forth fruitless prayer
To powers that will not hear.
And such did Paris come
Unto Atrides' home,
And thence, with sin and shame his welcome to repay,
Ravished the wife away--
And she, unto her country and her kin
Leaving the clash of shields and spears and arming ships,
And bearing unto Troy destruction for a dower,
And overbold in sin,
Went fleetly thro' the gates, at midnight hour.
Oft from the prophets' lips
Moaned out the warning and the wail--Ah woe!
Woe for the home, the home! and for the chieftains, woe
Woe for the bride-bed, warm
Yet from the lovely limbs, the impress of the form
Of her who loved her lord, a while ago!
And woe! for him who stands
Shamed, silent, unreproachful, stretching hands
That find her not, and sees, yet will not see,
That she is far away!
And his sad fancy, yearning o'er the sea,
Shall summon and recall
Her wraith, once more to queen it in his hall.
And sad with many memories,
The fair cold beauty of each sculptured face--
And all to hatefulness is turned their grace,
Seen blankly by forlorn and hungering eyes!
And when the night is deep,
Come visions, sweet and sad, and bearing pain
Of hopings vain--
Void, void and vain, for scarce the sleeping sight
Has seen its old delight,
When thro' the grasps of love that bid it stay
It vanishes away
On silent wings that roam adown the ways of sleep.
Such are the sights, the sorrows fell,
About our hearth--and worse, whereof I may not tell.
But, all the wide town o'er,
Each home that sent its master far away
From Hellas' shore,
Feels the keen thrill of heart, the pang of loss, to-day.
For, truth to say,
The touch of bitter death is manifold!
Familiar was each face, and dear as life,
That went unto the war,
But thither, whence a warrior went of old,
Doth nought return--
Only a spear and sword, and ashes in an urn!
For Ares, lord of strife,
Who doth the swaying scales of battle hold,
War's money-changer, giving dust for gold,
Sends back, to hearts that held them dear,
Scant ash of warriors, wept with many a tear,
Light to the hand, but heavy to the soul;
Yea, fills the light urn full
With what survived the flame--
Death's dusty measure of a hero's frame!
""Alas!"" one cries, ""and yet alas again!
Our chief is gone, the hero of the spear,
And hath not left his peer!
Ah woe!"" Anothermoans--""my spouse is slain,
The death of honour, rolled in dust and blood,
Slain for a woman's sin, a false wife's shame!""
Such muttered words of bitter mood
Rise against those who went forth to reclaim;
Yea, jealous wrath creeps on against th' Atrides' name.
And others, far beneath the Ilian wall,
Sleep their last sleep--the goodly chiefs and tall,
Couched in the foeman's land, whereon they gave
Their breath, and lords of Troy, each in his Trojan grave.
Therefore for each and all the city's breast
Is heavy with a wrath supprest,
As deep and deadly as a curse more loud
Flung by the common crowd;
And, brooding deeply, doth my soul await
Tidings of coming fate,
Buried as yet in darkness' womb.
For not forgetful is the high gods' doom
Against the sons of carnage: all too long
Seems the unjust to prosper and be strong,
Till the dark Furies come,
And smite with stern reversal all his home,
Down into dim obstruction--he is gone,
And help and hope, among the lost, is none!
O'er him who vaunteth an exceeding fame,
Impends a woe condign;
The vengeful bolt upon his eyes doth flame,
Sped from the hand divine.
This bliss be mine, ungrudged of God, to feel--
To tread no city to the dust,
Nor see my own life thrust
Down to a slave's estate beneath another's heel!
Behold, throughout the city wide
Have the swift feet of Rumour hied,
Roused by the joyful flame:
But is the news they scatter, sooth?
Or haply do they give for truth
Some cheat which heaven doth frame?
A child were he and all unwise,
Who let his heart with joy be stirred,
To see the beacon-fires arise,
And then, beneath some thwarting word,
Sicken anon with hope deferred.
The edge of woman's insight still
Good news from true divideth ill;
Light rumours leap within the bound
That fences female credence round,
But, lightly born, as lightly dies
The tale that springs of her surmise.
Soon shall we know whereof the bale-fires tell,
The beacons, kindled with transmitted flame;
Whether, as well I deem, their tale is true.
Or whether like some dream delusive came
The welcome blaze but to befool our soul.
For lo! I see a HERALD from the shore
Draw hither, shadowed with the olive-wreath--
And thirsty dust, twin-brother of the clay,
Speaks plain of travel far and truthful news--
No dumb surmise, nor tongue of flame in smoke,
Fitfully kindled from the mountain pyre;
But plainlier shall his voice say, ""All is well,""
Or--but away, forebodings adverse, now,
And on fair promise fair fulfilment come!
And whoso for the state prays otherwise,
Himself reap harvest of his ill desire!
Enter HERALD
O land of Argos, fatherland of mine!
To thee at last, beneath the tenth year's sun,
My feet return; the bark of my emprise,
Tho' one by one hope's anchors broke away,
Held by the last, and now rides safely here.
Long, long my soul despaired to win, in death,
Its longed-for rest within our Argive land:
And now all hail, O earth, and hail to thee,
New-risen sun! and hail our country's God,
High-ruling Zeus, and thou, the Pythian lord,
Whose arrows smote us once--smite thou no more!
Was not thy wrath wreaked full upon our heads,
O king Apollo, by Scamander's side?
Turn thou, be turned, be saviour, healer, now!
And hail, all gods who rule the street and mart
And Hermes hail! my patron and my pride,
HERALD of heaven, and lord of HERALDs here!
And Heroes, ye who sped us on our way--
To one and all I cry, ""Receive again
With grace such Argives as the spear has spared.""
Ah, home of royalty, beloved halls,
And solemn shrines, and gods that front the morn!
Benign as erst, with sun-flushed aspect greet
The king returning after many days.
For as from night flash out the beams of day,
So out of darkness dawns a light, a king,
On you, on Argos--AGAMEMNON comes.
Then hail and greet him well! such meed befits
Him whose right hand hewed down the towers of Troy
With the great axe of Zeus who righteth wrong--
And smote the plain, smote down to nothingness
Each altar, every shrine; and far and wide
Dies from the whole land's face its offspring fair.
Such mighty yoke of fate he set on Troy--
Our lord and monarch, Atreus' elder son,
And comes at last with blissful honour home;
Highest of all who walk on earth to-day--
Not Paris nor the city's self that paid
Sin's price with him, can boast, ""Whate'er befal,
The guerdon we have won outweighs it all.""
But at Fate's judgment-seat the robber stands
Condemned of rapine, and his prey is torn
Forth from his hands, and by his deed is reaped
A bloody harvest of his home and land
Gone down to death, and for his guilt and lust
His father's race pays double in the dust.
CHORUS
Hail, HERALD of the Greeks, new-come from war.
HERALD
All hail! not death itself can fright me now.
CHORUS
Was thine heart wrung with longing for thy land?
HERALD
So that this joy doth brim mine eyes with tears.
CHORUS
On you too then this sweet distress did fall--
HERALD
How say'st thou? make me master of thy word.
CHORUS
You longed for us who pined for you again.
HERALD
Craved the land us who craved it, love for love?
CHORUS
Yea till my brooding heart moaned out with pain.
HERALD
Whence thy despair, that mars the army's joy?
CHORUS
""Sole cure of wrong is silence,"" saith the saw.
HERALD
Thy kings afar, couldst thou fear other men?
CHORUS
Death had been sweet, as thou didst say but now.
HERALD
'Tis true; Fate smiles at last. Throughout our toil,
These many years, some chances issued fair,
And some, I wot, were chequered with a curse.
But who, on earth, hath won the bliss of heaven,
Thro' time's whole tenor an unbroken weal?
I could a tale unfold of toiling oars,
Ill rest, scant landings on a shore rock-strewn,
All pains, all sorrows, for our daily doom.
And worse and hatefuller our woes on land;
For where we couched, close by the foeman's wall,
The river-plain was ever dank with dews,
Dropped from the sky, exuded from the earth,
A curse that clung unto our sodden garb,
And hair as horrent as a wild beast's fell.
Why tell the woes of winter, when the birds
Lay stark and stiff, so stern was Ida's snow?
Or summer's scorch, what time the stirless wave
Sank to its sleep beneath the noon-day sun?
Why mourn old woes? their pain has passed away;
And passed away, from those who fell, all care,
For evermore, to rise and live again.
Why sum the count of death, and render thanks
For life by moaning over fate malign?
Farewell, a long farewell to all our woes!
To us, the remnant of the host of Greece,
Comes weal beyond all counterpoise of woe;
Thus boast we rightfully to yonder sun,
Like him far-fleeted over sea and land.
""The Argive host prevailed to conquer Troy,
And in the temples of the gods of Greece
Hung up these spoils, a shining sign to Time.""
Let those who learn this legend bless aright
The city and its chieftains, and repay
The meed of gratitude to Zeus who willed
And wrought the deed. So stands the tale fulfilled.
CHORUS
Thy words o'erbear my doubt: for news of good,
The ear of age hath ever youth enow:
But those within and CLYTEMNESTRA's self
Would fain hear all; glad thou their ears and mine.
Re-enter 'CLYTEMNESTRA
Last night, when first the fiery courier came,
In sign that Troy is ta'en and razed to earth,
So wild a cry of joy my lips gave out,
That I was chidden--""Hath the beacon watch
Made sure unto thy soul the sack of Troy?
A very woman thou, whose heart leaps light
At wandering rumours!""--and with words like these
They showed me how I strayed, misled of hope.
Yet on each shrine I set the sacrifice,
And, in the strain they held for feminine,
Went HERALDs thro' the city, to and fro,
With voice of loud proclaim, announcing joy;
And in each fane they lit and quenched with wine
The spicy perfumes fading in the flame.
All is fulfilled: I spare your longer tale--
The king himself anon shall tell me all.
Remains to think what honour best may greet
My lord, the majesty of Argos, home.
What day beams fairer on a woman's eyes
Than this, whereon she flings the portal wide,
To hail her lord, heaven-shielded, home from war?
This to my husband, that he tarry not,
But turn the city's longing into joy!
Yea let him come, and coming may he find
A wife no other than he left her, true
And faithful as a watch-dog to his home,
His foemen's foe, in all her duties leal,
Trusty to keep for ten long years unmarred
The store whereon he set his master-seal.
Be steel deep-dyed, before ye look to see
Ill joy, ill fame, from other wight, in me!
HERALD
'Tis fairly said: thus speaks a noble dame,
Nor speaks amiss, when truth informs the boast.
Exit CLYTEMNESTRA.
CHORUS
So has she spoken--be it yours to learn
By clear interpreters her specious word.
Turn to me, HERALD--tell me if anon
The second well-loved lord of Argos comes?
Hath Menelaus safely sped with you?
HERALD
Alas--brief boon unto my friends it were,
To flatter them, for truth, with falsehoods fair!
CHORUS
Speak joy, if truth be joy, but truth, at worst--
loo plainly, truth and joy are here divorced.
HERALD
The hero and his bark were rapt away
Far from the Grecian fleet? 'tis truth I say.
CHORUS
Whether in all men's sight from Ilion borne,
Or from the fleet by stress of weather torn?
HERALD
Full on the mark thy shaft of speech doth light,
And one short word hath told long woes aright.
CHORUS
But say, what now of him each comrade saith?
What their forebodings, of his life or death?
HERALD
Ask me no more: the truth is known to none,
Save the earth-fostering, all-surveying Sun,
CHORUS
Say, by what doom the fleet of Greece was driven?
How rose, how sank the storm, the wrath of heaven?
HERALD
Nay, ill it were to mar with sorrow's tale
The day of blissful news. The gods demand
Thanksgiving sundered from solicitude.
If one as HERALD came with rueful face
To say, ""The curse has fallen, and the host
Gone down to death; and one wide wound has reached
The city's heart, and out of many homes
Many are cast and consecrate to death,
Beneath the double scourge, that Ares loves,
The bloody pair, the fire and sword of doom""--
If such sore burden weighed upon my tongue,
'Twere fit to speak such words as gladden fiends.
But--coming as he comes who bringeth news
Of safe return from toil, and issues fair,
To men rejoicing in a weal restored--
Dare I to dash good words with ill, and say
How the gods' anger smote the Greeks in storm?
For fire and sea, that erst held bitter feud,
Now swore conspiracy and pledged their faith,
Wasting the Argives worn with toil and war.
Night and great horror of the rising wave
Came o'er us, and the blasts that blow from Thrace
Clashed ship with ship, and some with plunging prow
Thro' scudding drifts of spray and raving storm
Vanished, as strays by some ill shepherd driven.
And when at length the sun rose bright, we saw
Th' Aegaean sea-field flecked with flowers of death,
Corpses of Grecian men and shattered hulls.
For us indeed, some god, as well I deem,
No human power, laid hand upon our helm,
Snatched us or prayed us from the powers of air,
And brought our bark thro' all, unharmed in hull:
And saving Fortune sat and steered us fair,
So that no surge should gulf us deep in brine,
Nor grind our keel upon a rocky shor",en,LABEL_0,0.4516289532184601,LABEL_1,0.5483710169792175

A BREAK IN THE NARRATIVE: OLD FRIENDS IN NEW ASPECTS ‚Äî THE MARQUIS DE NORPOIS ‚Äî BERGOTTE ‚Äî HOW I CEASE FOR THE TIME BEING TO SEE GILBERTE: A GENERAL OUTLINE OF THE SORROW CAUSED BY A PARTING AND OF THE IRREGULAR PROCESS OF OBLIVION
¬†¬†¬† My mother, when it was a question of our having M. de Norpois to dinner for the first time, having expressed her regret that Professor Cottard was away from home, and that she herself had quite ceased to see anything of Swann, since either of these might have helped to entertain the old Ambassador, my father replied that so eminent a guest, so distinguished a man of science as Cottard could never be out of place at a dinner-table, but that Swann, with his ostentation, his habit of crying aloud from the housetops the name of everyone that he knew, however slightly, was an impossible vulgarian whom the Marquis de Norpois would be sure to dismiss as ‚Äî to use his own epithet ‚Äî a ‚Äòpestilent‚Äô fellow. Now, this attitude on my father‚Äôs part may be felt to require a few words of explanation, inasmuch as some of us, no doubt, remember a Cottard of distinct mediocrity and a Swann by whom modesty and discretion, in all his social relations, were carried to the utmost refinement of delicacy. But in his case, what had happened was that, to the original ‚Äòyoung Swann‚Äô and also to the Swann of the Jockey Club, our old friend had added a fresh personality (which was not to be his last), that of Odette‚Äôs husband. Adapting to the humble ambitions of that lady the instinct, the desire, the industry which he had always had, he had laboriously constructed for himself, a long way beneath the old, a new position more appropriate to the companion who was to share it with him. In this he shewed himself another man. Since (while he continued to go, by himself, to the houses of his own friends, on whom he did not care to inflict Odette unless they had expressly asked that she should be introduced to them) it was a new life that he had begun to lead, in common with his wife, among a new set of people, it was quite intelligible that, in order to estimate the importance of these new friends and thereby the pleasure, the self-esteem that were to be derived from entertaining them, he should have made use, as a standard of comparison, not of the brilliant society in which he himself had moved before his marriage but of the earlier environment of Odette. And yet, even when one knew that it was with unfashionable officials and their faded wives, the wallflowers of ministerial ball-rooms, that he was now anxious to associate, it was still astonishing to hear him, who in the old days, and even still, would so gracefully refrain from mentioning an invitation to Twickenham or to Marlborough House, proclaim with quite unnecessary emphasis that the wife of some Assistant Under-Secretary for Something had returned Mme. Swann‚Äôs call. It will perhaps be objected here that what this really implied was that the simplicity of the fashionable Swann had been nothing more than a supreme refinement of vanity, and that, like certain other Israelites, my parents‚Äô old friend had contrived to illustrate in turn all the stages through which his race had passed, from the crudest and coarsest form of snobbishness up to the highest pitch of good manners. But the chief reason ‚Äî and one which is applicable to humanity as a whole ‚Äî was that our virtues themselves are not free and floating qualities over which we retain a permanent control and power of disposal; they come to be so closely linked in our minds with the actions in conjunction with which we make it our duty to practise them, that, if we are suddenly called upon to perform some action of a different order, it takes us by surprise, and without our supposing for a moment that it might involve the bringing of those very same virtues into play. Swann, in his intense consciousness of his new social surroundings, and in the pride with which he referred to them, was like those great artists ‚Äî modest or generous by nature ‚Äî who, if at the end of their career they take to cooking or to gardening, display a childlike gratification at the compliments that are paid to their dishes or their borders, and will not listen to any of the criticism which they heard unmoved when it was applied to their real achievements; or who, after giving away a canvas, cannot conceal their annoyance if they lose a couple of francs at dominoes
¬†¬†¬† As for Professor Cottard, we shall meet him again and can study him at our leisure, much later in the course of our story, with the ‚ÄòMistress,‚Äô Mme. Verdurin, in her country house La Raspeli√®re. For the present, the following observations must suffice; first of all, in the case of Swann the alteration might indeed be surprising, since it had been accomplished and yet was not suspected by me when I used to see Gilberte‚Äôs father in the Champs-Elys√©es, where, moreover, as he never spoke to me, he could not very well have made any display of his political relations. It is true that, if he had done so, I might not at once have discerned his vanity, for the idea that one has long held of a person is apt to stop one‚Äôs eyes and ears; my mother, for three whole years, had no more noticed the salve with which one of her nieces used to paint her lips than if it had been wholly and invisibly dissolved in some clear liquid; until one day a streak too much, or possibly something else, brought about the phenomenon known as super-saturation; all the paint that had hitherto passed unperceived was now crystallised, and my mother, in the face of this sudden riot of colour, declared, in the best Combray manner, that it was a perfect scandal, and almost severed relations with her niece. With Cottard, on the contrary, the epoch in which we have seen him assisting at the first introduction of Swann to the Verdurins was now buried in the past; whereas honours, offices and titles come with the passage of years; moreover, a man may be illiterate, and make stupid puns, and yet have a special gift, which no amount of general culture can replace ‚Äî such as the gift of a great strategist or physician. And so it was not merely as an obscure practitioner, who had attained in course of time to European celebrity, that the rest of his profession regarded Cottard. The most intelligent of the younger doctors used to assert ‚Äî for a year or two, that is to say, for fashions, being themselves begotten of the desire for change, are quick to change also ‚Äî that if they themselves ever fell ill Cottard was the only one of the leading men to whom they would entrust their lives. No doubt they preferred, socially, to meet certain others who were better read, more artistic, with whom they could discuss Nietzsche and Wagner. When there was a musical party at Mme. Cottard‚Äôs, on the evenings when she entertained ‚Äî in the hope that it might one day make him Dean of the Faculty ‚Äî the colleagues and pupils of her husband, he, instead of listening, preferred to play cards in another room. Yet everybody praised the quickness, the penetration, the unerring confidence with which, at a glance, he could diagnose disease. Thirdly, in considering the general impression which Professor Cottard must have made on a man like my father, we must bear in mind that the character which a man exhibits in the latter half of his life is not always, even if it is often his original character developed or withered, attenuated or enlarged; it is sometimes the exact opposite, like a garment that has been turned. Except from the Verdurins, who were infatuated with him, Cottard‚Äôs hesitating manner, his excessive timidity and affability had, in his young days, called down upon him endless taunts and sneers. What charitable friend counselled that glacial air? The importance of his professional standing made it all the more easy to adopt. Wherever he went, save at the Verdurins‚Äô, where he instinctively became himself again, he would assume a repellent coldness, remain silent as long as possible, be peremptory when he was obliged to speak, and not forget to say the most cutting things. He had every opportunity of rehearsing this new attitude before his patients, who, seeing him for the first time, were not in a position to make comparisons, and would have been greatly surprised to learn that he was not at all a rude man by nature. Complete impassivity was what he strove to attain, and even while visiting his hospital wards, when he allowed himself to utter one of those puns which left everyone, from the house physician to the junior student, helpless with laughter, he would always make it without moving a muscle of his face, while even that was no longer recognisable now that he had shaved off his beard and moustache
¬†¬†¬† But who, the reader has been asking, was the Marquis de Norpois? Well, he had been Minister Plenipotentiary before the War, and was actually an Ambassador on the Sixteenth of May; in spite of which, and to the general astonishment, he had since been several times chosen to represent France on Extraordinary Missions ‚Äî even as Controller of the Public Debt in Egypt, where, thanks to his great capability as a financier, he had rendered important services ‚Äî by Radical Cabinets under which a reactionary of the middle classes would have declined to serve, and in whose eyes M. de Norpois, in view of his past, his connexions and his opinions, ought presumably to have been suspect. But these advanced Ministers seemed to consider that, in making such an appointment, they were shewing how broad their own minds were, when the supreme interests of France were at stake, were raising themselves above the general run of politicians, were meriting, from the Journal des D√©bats itself, the title of ‚ÄòStatesmen,‚Äô and were reaping direct advantage from the weight that attaches to an aristocratic name and the dramatic interest always aroused by an unexpected appointment. And they knew also that they could reap these advantages by making an appeal to M. de Norpois, without having to fear any want of political loyalty on his part, a fault against which his noble birth not only need not put them on their guard but offered a positive guarantee. And in this calculation the Government of the Republic were not mistaken. In the first place, because an aristocrat of a certain type, brought up from his cradle to regard his name as an integral part of himself of which no accident can deprive him (an asset of whose value his peers, or persons of even higher rank, can form a fairly exact estimate), knows that he can dispense with the efforts (since they can in no way enhance his position) in which, without any appreciable result, so many public men of the middle class spend themselves ‚Äî to profess only the ‚Äòright‚Äô opinions, to frequent only the ‚Äòsound‚Äô people. Anxious, on the other hand, to increase his own importance in the eyes of the princely or ducal families which take immediate precedence of his own, he knows that he can do so by giving his name that complement which hitherto it has lacked, which will give it priority over other names heraldically its equals: such as political power, a literary or an artistic reputation, or a large fortune. And so what he saves by avoiding the society of the ineffective country squires, after whom all the professional families run helter-skelter, but of his intimacy with whom, were he to profess it, a prince would think nothing, he will lavish on the politicians who (free-masons, or worse, though they be) can advance him in Diplomacy or ‚Äòback‚Äô him in an election, and on the artists or scientists whose patronage can help him to ‚Äòarrive‚Äô in those departments in which they excel, on everyone, in fact, who is in a position to confer a fresh distinction or to ‚Äòbring off‚Äô a rich marriage
¬†¬†¬† But in the character of M. de Norpois there was this predominant feature, that, in the course of a long career of diplomacy, he had become imbued with that negative, methodical, conservative spirit, called ‚Äògovernmental,‚Äô which is common to all Governments and, under every Government, particularly inspires its Foreign Office. He had imbibed, during that career, an aversion, a dread, a contempt for the methods of procedure, more or less revolutionary and in any event quite incorrect, which are those of an Opposition. Save in the case of a few illiterates ‚Äî high or low, it makes no matter ‚Äî by whom no difference in quality is perceptible, what attracts men one to another is not a common point of view but a consanguinity of spirit. An Academician of the kind of Legouv√©, and therefore an upholder of the classics, would applaud Maxime Ducamp‚Äôs or Mezi√®re‚Äôs eulogy of Victor Hugo with more fervour than that of Boileau by Claudel. A common Nationalism suffices to endear Barr√©s to his electors, who scarcely distinguish between him and M. Georges Berry, but does not endear him to those of his brother Academicians who, with a similar outlook on politics but a different type of mind, will prefer to him even such open adversaries as M. Ribot and M. Deschanel, with whom, in turn, the most loyal Monarchists feel themselves more closely allied than with Maurras or L√©on Daudet, although these also are living in the hope of a glorious Restoration. Miserly in the use of words, not only from a professional scruple of prudence and reserve, but because words themselves have more value, present more subtleties of definition to men whose efforts, protracted over a decade, to bring two countries to an understanding, are condensed, translated ‚Äî in a speech or in a protocol ‚Äî into a single adjective, colourless in all appearance, but to them pregnant with a world of meaning, M. de Norpois was considered very stiff, at the Commission, where he sat next to my father, whom everyone else congratulated on the astonishing way in which the old Ambassador unbent to him. My father was himself more astonished than anyone. For not being, as a rule, very affable, his company was little sought outside his own intimate circle, a limitation which he used modestly and frankly to avow. He realised that these overtures were an outcome, in the diplomat, of that point of view which everyone adopts for himself in making his choice of friends, from which all a man‚Äôs intellectual qualities, his refinement, his affection are a far less potent recommendation of him, when at the same time he bores or irritates one, than are the mere straightforwardness and good-humour of another man whom most people would regard as frivolous or even fatuous. ‚ÄúDe Norpois has asked me to dinner again; it‚Äôs quite extraordinary; everyone on the Commission is amazed, as he never has any personal relations with any of us. I am sure he‚Äôs going to tell me something thrilling, again, about the ‚ÄòSeventy war.‚Äù My father knew that M. de Norpois had warned, had perhaps been alone in warning the Emperor of the growing strength and bellicose designs of Prussia, and that Bismarck rated his intelligence most highly. Only the other day, at the Opera, during the gala performance given for King Theodosius, the newspapers had all drawn attention to the long conversation which that Monarch had held with M. de Norpois. ‚ÄúI must ask him whether the King‚Äôs visit had any real significance,‚Äù my father went on, for he was keenly interested in foreign politics. ‚ÄúI know old Norpois keeps very close as a rule, but when he‚Äôs with me he opens out quite charmingly.‚Äù
¬†¬†¬† As for my mother, perhaps the Ambassador had not the type of mind towards which she felt herself most attracted. I should add that his conversation furnished so exhaustive a glossary of the superannuated forms of speech peculiar to a certain profession, class and period ‚Äî a period which, for that profession and that class, might be said not to have altogether passed away ‚Äî that I sometimes regret that I have not kept any literal record simply of the things that I have heard him say. I should thus have obtained an effect of old-fashioned courtesy by the same process and at as little expense as that actor at the Palais-Royal who, when asked where on earth he managed to find his astounding hats, answered, ‚ÄúI do not find my hats. I keep them.‚Äù In a word, I suppose that my mother considered M. de Norpois a trifle ‚Äòout-of-date,‚Äô which was by no means a fault in her eyes, so far as manners were concerned, but attracted her less in the region ‚Äî not, in this instance, of ideas, for those of M. de Norpois were extremely modern ‚Äî but of idiom. She felt, however, that she was paying a delicate compliment to her husband when she spoke admiringly of the diplomat who had shewn so remarkable a predilection for him. By confirming in my father‚Äôs mind the good opinion that he already had of M. de Norpois, and so inducing him to form a good opinion of himself also, she knew that she was carrying out that one of her wifely duties which consisted in making life pleasant and comfortable for her husband, just as when she saw to it that his dinner was perfectly cooked and served in silence. And as she was incapable of deceiving my father, she compelled herself to admire the old Ambassador, so as to be able to praise him with sincerity. Incidentally she could naturally, and did, appreciate his kindness, his somewhat antiquated courtesy (so ceremonious that when, as he was walking along the street, his tall figure rigidly erect, he caught sight of my mother driving past, before raising his hat to her he would fling away the cigar that he had just lighted); his conversation, so elaborately circumspect, in which he referred as seldom as possible to himself and always considered what might interest the person to whom he was speaking; his promptness in answering a letter, which was so astonishing that whenever my father, just after posting one himself to M. de Norpois, saw his handwriting upon an envelope, his first thought was always one of annoyance that their letters must, unfortunately, have crossed in the post; which, one was led to suppose, bestowed upon him the special and luxurious privilege of extraordinary deliveries and collections at all hours of the day and night. My mother marvelled at his being so punctilious although so busy, so friendly although so much in demand, never realising that ‚Äòalthough,‚Äô with such people, is invariably an unrecognised ‚Äòbecause,‚Äô and that (just as old men are always wonderful for their age, and kings extraordinarily simple, and country cousins astonishingly well-informed) it was the same system of habits that enabled M. de Norpois to undertake so many duties and to be so methodical in answering letters, to go everywhere and to be so friendly when he came to us. Moreover she made the mistake which everyone makes who is unduly modest; she rated everything that concerned herself below, and consequently outside the range of, other people‚Äôs duties and engagements. The letter which it seemed to her so meritorious in my father‚Äôs friend to have written us promptly, since in the course of the day he must have had ever so many letters to write, she excepted from that great number of letters, of which actually it was a unit; in the same way she did not consider that dining with us was, for M. de Norpois, merely one of the innumerable activities of his social life; she never guessed that the Ambassador had trained himself, long ago, to look upon dining-out as one of his diplomatic functions, and to display, at table, an inveterate charm which it would have been too much to have expected him specially to discard when he came to dine with us
¬†¬†¬† The evening on which M. de Norpois first appeared at our table, in a year when I still went to play in the Champs-Elys√©es, has remained fixed in my memory because the afternoon of the same day was that upon which I at last went to hear Berma, at a matin√©e, in Ph√®dre, and also because in talking to M. de Norpois I realised suddenly, and in a new and different way, how completely the feelings aroused in me by all that concerned Gilberte Swann and her parents differed from any that the same family could inspire in anyone else
¬†¬†¬† It was no doubt the sight of the depression in which I was plunged by the approach of the New Year holidays, in which, as she herself had informed me, I was to see nothing of Gilberte, that prompted my mother one day, in the hope of distracting my mind, to suggest, ‚ÄúIf you are still so anxious to hear Berma, I think that your father would allow you perhaps to go; your grandmother can take you.‚Äù
¬†¬†¬† But it was because M. de Norpois had told him that he ought to let me hear Berma, that it was an experience for a young man to remember in later life, that my father, who had hitherto been so resolutely opposed to my going and wasting my time, with the added risk of my falling ill again, on what he used to shock my grandmother by calling ‚Äòfutilities,‚Äô was now not far from regarding this manner of spending an afternoon as included, in some vague way, in the list of precious formulae for success in a brilliant career. My grandmother, who, in renouncing on my behalf the profit which, according to her, I should have derived from hearing Berma, had made a considerable sacrifice in the interests of my health, was surprised to find that this last had become of no account at a mere word from M. de Norpois. Reposing the unconquerable hopes of her rationalist spirit in the strict course of fresh air and early hours which had been prescribed for me, she now deplored, as something disastrous, this infringement that I was to make of my rules, and in a tone of despair protested, ‚ÄúHow easily led you are!‚Äù to my father, who replied angrily ‚ÄúWhat! So it‚Äôs you that are not for letting him go, now. That is really too much, after your telling us all day and every day that it would be so good for him.‚Äù
¬†¬†¬† M. de Norpois had also brought about a change in my father‚Äôs plans in a matter of far greater importance to myself. My father had always meant me to become a diplomat, and I could not endure the thought that, even if I did have to stay for some years, first, at the Ministry, I should run the risk of being sent, later on, as Ambassador, to capitals in which no Gilberte dwelt. I should have preferred to return to the literary career that I had planned for myself, and had been abandoned, years before, in my wanderings along the Guermantes way. But my father had steadily opposed my devoting myself to literature, which he regarded as vastly inferior to diplomacy, refusing even to dignify it with the title of career, until the day when M. de Norpois, who had little love for the more recent generations of diplomatic agents, assured him that it was quite possible, by writing, to attract as much attention, to receive as much consideration, to exercise as much influence, and at the same time to preserve more independence than in the Embassies
¬†¬†¬† ‚ÄúWell, well, I should never have believed it. Old Norpois doesn‚Äôt at all disapprove of your idea of taking up writing,‚Äù my father had reported. And as he had a certain amount of influence himself, he imagined that there was nothing that could not be ‚Äòarranged,‚Äô no problem for which a happy solution might not be found in the conversation of people who ‚Äòcounted.‚Äô ‚ÄúI shall bring him back to dinner, one of these days, from the Commission. You must talk to him a little, and let him see what he thinks of you. Write something good that you can shew him; he is an intimate friend of the editor of the Deux-Mondes; he will get you in there; he will arrange it all, the cunning old fox; and, upon my soul, he seems to think that diplomacy, nowadays ‚Äî‚Äî!‚Äù
¬†¬†¬† My happiness in the prospect of not being separated from Gilberte made me desirous, but not capable, of writing something good which could be shewn to M. de Norpois. After a few laboured pages, weariness made the pen drop from my fingers; I cried with anger at the thought that I should never have any talent, that I was not ‚Äògifted,‚Äô that I could not even take advantage of the chance that M. de Norpois‚Äôs coming visit was to offer me of spending the rest of my life in Paris. The recollection that I was to be taken to hear Berma alone distracted me from my grief. But just as I did not wish to see any storms except on those coasts where they raged with most violence, so I should not have cared to hear the great actress except in one of those classic parts in which Swann had told me that she touched the sublime. For when it is in the hope of making a priceless discovery that we desire to receive certain impressions from nature or from works of art, we have certain scruples about allowing our soul to gather, instead of these, other, inferior, impressions, which are liable to make us form a false estimate of the value of Beauty. Berma in Andromaque, in Les Caprices de Marianne, in Ph√®dre, was one of those famous spectacles which my imagination had so long desired. I should enjoy the same rapture as on the day when in a gondola I glided to the foot of the Titian of the Frari or the Carpaccios of San Giorgio dei Schiavoni, were I ever to hear Berma repeat the lines beginning

¬†¬†¬† I was familiar with them from the simple reproduction in black and white which was given of them upon the printed page; but my heart beat furiously at the thought ‚Äî as of the realisation of a long-planned voyage ‚Äî that I should at length behold them, bathed and brought to life in the atmosphere and sunshine of the voice of gold. A Carpaccio in Venice, Berma in Ph√®dre, masterpieces of pictorial or dramatic art which the glamour, the dignity attaching to them made so living to me, that is to say so indivisible, that if I had been taken to see Carpaccios in one of the galleries of the Louvre, or Berma in some piece of which I had never heard, I should not have experienced the same delicious amazement at finding myself at length, with wide-open eyes, before the unique and inconceivable object of so many thousand dreams. Then, while I waited, expecting to derive from Berma‚Äôs playing the revelation of certain aspects of nobility and tragic grief, it would seem to me that whatever greatness, whatever truth there might be in her playing must be enhanced if the actress imposed it upon a work of real value, instead of what would, after all, be but embroidering a pattern of truth and beauty upon a commonplace and vulgar web
¬†¬†¬† Finally, if I went to hear Berma in a new piece, it would not be easy for me to judge of her art, of her diction, since I should not be able to differentiate between a text which was not already familiar and what she added to it by her intonations and gestures, an addition which would seem to me to be embodied in the play itself; whereas the old plays, the classics which I knew by heart, presented themselves to me as vast and empty walls, reserved and made ready for my inspection, on which I should be able to appreciate without restriction the devices by which Berma would cover them, as with frescoes, with the perpetually fresh treasures of her inspiration. Unfortunately, for some years now, since she had retired from the great theatres, to make the fortune of one on the boulevards where she was the ‚Äòstar,‚Äô she had ceased to appear in classic parts; and in vain did I scan the hoardings; they never advertised any but the newest pieces, written specially for her by authors in fashion at the moment. When, one morning, as I stood searching the column of announcements to find the afternoon performances for the week of the New Year holidays, I saw there for the first time ‚Äî at the foot of the bill, after some probably insignificant curtain-raiser, whose title was opaque to me because it had latent in it all the details of an action of which I was ignorant ‚Äî two acts ofPh√®dre with Mme. Berma, and, on the following afternoons, Le Demi-Monde, Les Caprices de Marianne, names which, like that of Ph√®dre, were for me transparent, filled with light only, so familiar were those works to me, illuminated to their very depths by the revealing smile of art. They seemed to me to invest with a fresh nobility Mme. Berma herself when I read in the newspapers, after the programme of these performances, that it was she who had decided to shew herself once more to the public in some of her early creations. She was conscious, then, that certain stage-parts have an interest which survives the novelty of their first production or the success of a revival; she regarded them, when interpreted by herself, as museum pieces which it might be instructive to set before the eyes of the generation which had admired her in them long ago, or of that which had never yet seen her in them. In thus advertising, in the middle of a column of plays intended only to while away an evening, this Ph√®dre, a title no longer than any of the rest, nor set in different type, she added something indescribable, as though a hostess, introducing you, before you all go in to dinner, to her other guests, were to mention, casually, amid the string of names which are the names of guests and nothing more, and without any change of tone:‚Äî‚ÄúM. Anatole France.‚Äù
¬†¬†¬† The doctor who was attending me ‚Äî the same who had forbidden me to travel ‚Äî advised my parents not to let me go to the theatre; I should only be ill again afterwards, perhaps for weeks, and should in the long run derive more pain than pleasure from the experience. The fear of this might have availed to stop me, if what I had anticipated from such a spectacle had been only a pleasure for which a subsequent pain could so compensate as to cancel it. But what I demanded from this performance ‚Äî just as from the visit to Balbec, the visit to Venice for which I had so intensely longed ‚Äî was something quite different from pleasure; a series of verities pertaining to a world more real than that in which I lived, which, once acquired, could never be taken from me again by any of the trivial incidents ‚Äî even though it were the cause of bodily suffering ‚Äî of my otiose existence. At best, the pleasure which I was to feel during the performance appeared to me as the perhaps inevitable form of the perception of these truths; and I hoped only that the illness which had been forecast for me would not begin until the play was finished, so that my pleasure should not be in any way compromised or spoiled. I implored my parents, who, after the doctor‚Äôs visit, were no longer inclined to let me go to Ph√®dre. I repeated, all day long, to myself, the speech beginning

¬†¬†¬† seeking out every intonation that could be put into it, so as to be able better to measure my surprise at the way which Berma would have found of uttering the lines. Concealed, like the Holy of Holies, beneath the veil that screened her from my gaze, behind which I invested her, every moment, with a fresh aspect, according to which of the words of Bergotte ‚Äî in the pamphlet that Gilberte had found for me ‚Äî was passing through my mind; ‚Äúplastic nobility,‚Äù ‚ÄúChristian austerity‚Äù or ‚ÄúJansenist pallor,‚Äù ‚ÄúPrincess of Troezen and of Cleves‚Äù or ‚ÄúMycenean drama,‚Äù ‚ÄúDelphic symbol,‚Äù ‚ÄúSolar myth‚Äù; that divine Beauty, whom Berma‚Äôs acting was to reveal to me, night and day, upon an altar perpetually illumined, sat enthroned hi the sanctuary of my mind, my mind for which not itself but my stern, my fickle parents were to decide whether or not it was to enshrine, and for all time, the perfections of the Deity unveiled, in the same spot where was now her invisible form. And with my eyes fixed upon that inconceivable image, I strove from morning to night to overcome the barriers which my family were putting in my way.

They had dined together in San Francisco, and were at the Ferry Building, returning to Oakland, when the whim came to him to show Martin the ‚Äúreal dirt.‚Äù He turned and fled across the water-front, a meagre shadow in a flapping overcoat, with Martin straining to keep up with him. At a wholesale liquor store he bought two gallon-demijohns of old port, and with one in each hand boarded a Mission Street car, Martin at his heels burdened with several quart-bottles of whiskey.
If Ruth could see me now, was his thought, while he wondered as to what constituted the real dirt.
‚ÄúMaybe nobody will be there,‚Äù Brissenden said, when they dismounted and plunged off to the right into the heart of the working-class ghetto, south of Market Street. ‚ÄúIn which case you‚Äôll miss what you‚Äôve been looking for so long.‚Äù
‚ÄúAnd what the deuce is that?‚Äù Martin asked.
‚ÄúMen, intelligent men, and not the gibbering nonentities I found you consorting with in that trader‚Äôs den. You read the books and you found yourself all alone. Well, I‚Äôm going to show you to-night some other men who‚Äôve read the books, so that you won‚Äôt be lonely any more.‚Äù
‚ÄúNot that I bother my head about their everlasting discussions,‚Äù he said at the end of a block. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not interested in book philosophy. But you‚Äôll find these fellows intelligences and not bourgeois swine. But watch out, they‚Äôll talk an arm off of you on any subject under the sun.‚Äù
‚ÄúHope Norton‚Äôs there,‚Äù he panted a little later, resisting Martin‚Äôs effort to relieve him of the two demijohns. ‚ÄúNorton‚Äôs an idealist‚Äîa Harvard man. Prodigious memory. Idealism led him to philosophic anarchy, and his family threw him off. Father‚Äôs a railroad president and many times millionnaire, but the son‚Äôs starving in ‚ÄôFrisco, editing an anarchist sheet for twenty-five a month.‚Äù
Martin was little acquainted in San Francisco, and not at all south of Market; so he had no idea of where he was being led.
‚ÄúGo ahead,‚Äù he said; ‚Äútell me about them beforehand. What do they do for a living? How do they happen to be here?‚Äù
‚ÄúHope Hamilton‚Äôs there.‚Äù Brissenden paused and rested his hands. ‚ÄúStrawn-Hamilton‚Äôs his name‚Äîhyphenated, you know‚Äîcomes of old Southern stock. He‚Äôs a tramp‚Äîlaziest man I ever knew, though he‚Äôs clerking, or trying to, in a socialist co√∂perative store for six dollars a week. But he‚Äôs a confirmed hobo. Tramped into town. I‚Äôve seen him sit all day on a bench and never a bite pass his lips, and in the evening, when I invited him to dinner‚Äîrestaurant two blocks away‚Äîhave him say, ‚ÄòToo much trouble, old man. Buy me a package of cigarettes instead.‚Äô He was a Spencerian like you till Kreis turned him to materialistic monism. I‚Äôll start him on monism if I can. Norton‚Äôs another monist‚Äîonly he affirms naught but spirit. He can give Kreis and Hamilton all they want, too.‚Äù
‚ÄúWho is Kreis?‚Äù Martin asked.
‚ÄúHis rooms we‚Äôre going to. One time professor‚Äîfired from university‚Äîusual story. A mind like a steel trap. Makes his living any old way. I know he‚Äôs been a street fakir when he was down. Unscrupulous. Rob a corpse of a shroud‚Äîanything. Difference between him and the bourgeoisie is that he robs without illusion. He‚Äôll talk Nietzsche, or Schopenhauer, or Kant, or anything, but the only thing in this world, not excepting Mary, that he really cares for, is his monism. Haeckel is his little tin god. The only way to insult him is to take a slap at Haeckel.‚Äù
‚ÄúHere‚Äôs the hang-out.‚Äù Brissenden rested his demijohn at the upstairs entrance, preliminary to the climb. It was the usual two-story corner building, with a saloon and grocery underneath. ‚ÄúThe gang lives here‚Äîgot the whole upstairs to themselves. But Kreis is the only one who has two rooms. Come on.‚Äù
No lights burned in the upper hall, but Brissenden threaded the utter blackness like a familiar ghost. He stopped to speak to Martin.
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs one fellow‚ÄîStevens‚Äîa theosophist. Makes a pretty tangle when he gets going. Just now he‚Äôs dish-washer in a restaurant. Likes a good cigar. I‚Äôve seen him eat in a ten-cent hash-house and pay fifty cents for the cigar he smoked afterward. I‚Äôve got a couple in my pocket for him, if he shows up.‚Äù
‚ÄúAnd there‚Äôs another fellow‚ÄîParry‚Äîan Australian, a statistician and a sporting encyclopaedia. Ask him the grain output of Paraguay for 1903, or the English importation of sheetings into China for 1890, or at what weight Jimmy Britt fought Battling Nelson, or who was welter-weight champion of the United States in ‚Äô68, and you‚Äôll get the correct answer with the automatic celerity of a slot-machine. And there‚Äôs Andy, a stone-mason, has ideas on everything, a good chess-player; and another fellow, Harry, a baker, red hot socialist and strong union man. By the way, you remember Cooks‚Äô and Waiters‚Äô strike‚ÄîHamilton was the chap who organized that union and precipitated the strike‚Äîplanned it all out in advance, right here in Kreis‚Äôs rooms. Did it just for the fun of it, but was too lazy to stay by the union. Yet he could have risen high if he wanted to. There‚Äôs no end to the possibilities in that man‚Äîif he weren‚Äôt so insuperably lazy.‚Äù
Brissenden advanced through the darkness till a thread of light marked the threshold of a door. A knock and an answer opened it, and Martin found himself shaking hands with Kreis, a handsome brunette man, with dazzling white teeth, a drooping black mustache, and large, flashing black eyes. Mary, a matronly young blonde, was washing dishes in the little back room that served for kitchen and dining room. The front room served as bedchamber and living room. Overhead was the week‚Äôs washing, hanging in festoons so low that Martin did not see at first the two men talking in a corner. They hailed Brissenden and his demijohns with acclamation, and, on being introduced, Martin learned they were Andy and Parry. He joined them and listened attentively to the description of a prize-fight Parry had seen the night before; while Brissenden, in his glory, plunged into the manufacture of a toddy and the serving of wine and whiskey-and-sodas. At his command, ‚ÄúBring in the clan,‚Äù Andy departed to go the round of the rooms for the lodgers.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre lucky that most of them are here,‚Äù Brissenden whispered to Martin. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs Norton and Hamilton; come on and meet them. Stevens isn‚Äôt around, I hear. I‚Äôm going to get them started on monism if I can. Wait till they get a few jolts in them and they‚Äôll warm up.‚Äù
At first the conversation was desultory. Nevertheless Martin could not fail to appreciate the keen play of their minds. They were men with opinions, though the opinions often clashed, and, though they were witty and clever, they were not superficial. He swiftly saw, no matter upon what they talked, that each man applied the correlation of knowledge and had also a deep-seated and unified conception of society and the Cosmos. Nobody manufactured their opinions for them; they were all rebels of one variety or another, and their lips were strangers to platitudes. Never had Martin, at the Morses‚Äô, heard so amazing a range of topics discussed. There seemed no limit save time to the things they were alive to. The talk wandered from Mrs. Humphry Ward‚Äôs new book to Shaw‚Äôs latest play, through the future of the drama to reminiscences of Mansfield. They appreciated or sneered at the morning editorials, jumped from labor conditions in New Zealand to Henry James and Brander Matthews, passed on to the German designs in the Far East and the economic aspect of the Yellow Peril, wrangled over the German elections and Bebel‚Äôs last speech, and settled down to local politics, the latest plans and scandals in the union labor party administration, and the wires that were pulled to bring about the Coast Seamen‚Äôs strike. Martin was struck by the inside knowledge they possessed. They knew what was never printed in the newspapers‚Äîthe wires and strings and the hidden hands that made the puppets dance. To Martin‚Äôs surprise, the girl, Mary, joined in the conversation, displaying an intelligence he had never encountered in the few women he had met. They talked together on Swinburne and Rossetti, after which she led him beyond his depth into the by-paths of French literature. His revenge came when she defended Maeterlinck and he brought into action the carefully-thought-out thesis of ‚ÄúThe Shame of the Sun.‚Äù
Several other men had dropped in, and the air was thick with tobacco smoke, when Brissenden waved the red flag.
‚ÄúHere‚Äôs fresh meat for your axe, Kreis,‚Äù he said; ‚Äúa rose-white youth with the ardor of a lover for Herbert Spencer. Make a Haeckelite of him‚Äîif you can.‚Äù
Kreis seemed to wake up and flash like some metallic, magnetic thing, while Norton looked at Martin sympathetically, with a sweet, girlish smile, as much as to say that he would be amply protected.
Kreis began directly on Martin, but step by step Norton interfered, until he and Kreis were off and away in a personal battle. Martin listened and fain would have rubbed his eyes. It was impossible that this should be, much less in the labor ghetto south of Market. The books were alive in these men. They talked with fire and enthusiasm, the intellectual stimulant stirring them as he had seen drink and anger stir other men. What he heard was no longer the philosophy of the dry, printed word, written by half-mythical demigods like Kant and Spencer. It was living philosophy, with warm, red blood, incarnated in these two men till its very features worked with excitement. Now and again other men joined in, and all followed the discussion with cigarettes going out in their hands and with alert, intent faces.
Idealism had never attracted Martin, but the exposition it now received at the hands of Norton was a revelation. The logical plausibility of it, that made an appeal to his intellect, seemed missed by Kreis and Hamilton, who sneered at Norton as a metaphysician, and who, in turn, sneered back at them as metaphysicians. Phenomenon and noumenon were bandied back and forth. They charged him with attempting to explain consciousness by itself. He charged them with word-jugglery, with reasoning from words to theory instead of from facts to theory. At this they were aghast. It was the cardinal tenet of their mode of reasoning to start with facts and to give names to the facts.
When Norton wandered into the intricacies of Kant, Kreis reminded him that all good little German philosophies when they died went to Oxford. A little later Norton reminded them of Hamilton‚Äôs Law of Parsimony, the application of which they immediately claimed for every reasoning process of theirs. And Martin hugged his knees and exulted in it all. But Norton was no Spencerian, and he, too, strove for Martin‚Äôs philosophic soul, talking as much at him as to his two opponents.
‚ÄúYou know Berkeley has never been answered,‚Äù he said, looking directly at Martin. ‚ÄúHerbert Spencer came the nearest, which was not very near. Even the stanchest of Spencer‚Äôs followers will not go farther. I was reading an essay of Saleeby‚Äôs the other day, and the best Saleeby could say was that Herbert Spencer nearly succeeded in answering Berkeley.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou know what Hume said?‚Äù Hamilton asked. Norton nodded, but Hamilton gave it for the benefit of the rest. ‚ÄúHe said that Berkeley‚Äôs arguments admit of no answer and produce no conviction.‚Äù
‚ÄúIn his, Hume‚Äôs, mind,‚Äù was the reply. ‚ÄúAnd Hume‚Äôs mind was the same as yours, with this difference: he was wise enough to admit there was no answering Berkeley.‚Äù
Norton was sensitive and excitable, though he never lost his head, while Kreis and Hamilton were like a pair of cold-blooded savages, seeking out tender places to prod and poke. As the evening grew late, Norton, smarting under the repeated charges of being a metaphysician, clutching his chair to keep from jumping to his feet, his gray eyes snapping and his girlish face grown harsh and sure, made a grand attack upon their position.
‚ÄúAll right, you Haeckelites, I may reason like a medicine man, but, pray, how do you reason? You have nothing to stand on, you unscientific dogmatists with your positive science which you are always lugging about into places it has no right to be. Long before the school of materialistic monism arose, the ground was removed so that there could be no foundation. Locke was the man, John Locke. Two hundred years ago‚Äîmore than that, even in his ‚ÄòEssay concerning the Human Understanding,‚Äô he proved the non-existence of innate ideas. The best of it is that that is precisely what you claim. To-night, again and again, you have asserted the non-existence of innate ideas.
‚ÄúAnd what does that mean? It means that you can never know ultimate reality. Your brains are empty when you are born. Appearances, or phenomena, are all the content your minds can receive from your five senses. Then noumena, which are not in your minds when you are born, have no way of getting in‚Äî‚Äù
‚ÄúI deny‚Äî‚Äù Kreis started to interrupt.
‚ÄúYou wait till I‚Äôm done,‚Äù Norton shouted. ‚ÄúYou can know only that much of the play and interplay of force and matter as impinges in one way or another on our senses. You see, I am willing to admit, for the sake of the argument, that matter exists; and what I am about to do is to efface you by your own argument. I can‚Äôt do it any other way, for you are both congenitally unable to understand a philosophic abstraction.
‚ÄúAnd now, what do you know of matter, according to your own positive science? You know it only by its phenomena, its appearances. You are aware only of its changes, or of such changes in it as cause changes in your consciousness. Positive science deals only with phenomena, yet you are foolish enough to strive to be ontologists and to deal with noumena. Yet, by the very definition of positive science, science is concerned only with appearances. As somebody has said, phenomenal knowledge cannot transcend phenomena.
‚ÄúYou cannot answer Berkeley, even if you have annihilated Kant, and yet, perforce, you assume that Berkeley is wrong when you affirm that science proves the non-existence of God, or, as much to the point, the existence of matter.‚ÄîYou know I granted the reality of matter only in order to make myself intelligible to your understanding. Be positive scientists, if you please; but ontology has no place in positive science, so leave it alone. Spencer is right in his agnosticism, but if Spencer‚Äî‚Äù
But it was time to catch the last ferry-boat for Oakland, and Brissenden and Martin slipped out, leaving Norton still talking and Kreis and Hamilton waiting to pounce on him like a pair of hounds as soon as he finished.
‚ÄúYou have given me a glimpse of fairyland,‚Äù Martin said on the ferry-boat. ‚ÄúIt makes life worth while to meet people like that. My mind is all worked up. I never appreciated idealism before. Yet I can‚Äôt accept it. I know that I shall always be a realist. I am so made, I guess. But I‚Äôd like to have made a reply to Kreis and Hamilton, and I think I‚Äôd have had a word or two for Norton. I didn‚Äôt see that Spencer was damaged any. I‚Äôm as excited as a child on its first visit to the circus. I see I must read up some more. I‚Äôm going to get hold of Saleeby. I still think Spencer is unassailable, and next time I‚Äôm going to take a hand myself.‚Äù
But Brissenden, breathing painfully, had dropped off to sleep, his chin buried in a scarf and resting on his sunken chest, his body wrapped in the long overcoat and shaking to the vibration of the propellers.Embed",en,LABEL_0,0.5026358962059021,LABEL_1,0.4973641037940979

THE VAMPIRE IN LITERATURE
A consideration of the Vampire theme in literature must of necessity be somewhat eclectic, if not even arbitrary in the selection of works which it reviews and with which it sets out to deal. Any exhaustive inquiry is well-nigh impossible, and this not so much, perhaps, on account of the wealth of the material, although indeed there is a far vaster field than might generally be supposed, as owing to the very vague definition and indeterminate interpretation one is able to give to vampirism from a purely literary point of view. It is the craft of an artist in the telling of ghost-stories to see that his colours should not be too vivid and too clear, and no mean skill is required to suggest without explanation, to mass the shadows without derangement, to be occult yet not to be obscure. Accordingly it would be a matter of extreme difficulty to differentiate the malignant and death-dealing spectre or it may be even corpse who returns to wreak his foul revenge from the Vampire,--using this latter word in its widest sense, as one must employ it when speaking of literature, a caution which here given as regards this Chapter will serve once for all. In such a story, for example, as Dr. M. R. James' Count Magnus is the horrible revenant a ghost or a vampire? The writer has left the point ambiguous. It is of the very essence of his happy invention that he should do so, and the deftly veiled incertitude adds to the loathly terror of the thing. It will be readily remembered that the story relates how a traveller in Sweden about the middle of the last century whilst staying near an ancient manor house in Vestergothland obtains permission to examine the family papers and among these he comes upon the traces of a certain Count Magnus de la Gardie who in the year 1600 had built the house or herrg√•rd. Even after the lapse of two and a half centuries dark traditions are still lingering concerning this mysterious nobleman, whose body lies in a richly ornate copper sarcophagus that stands the principal feature of a domed mausoleum at the eastern end of the church. Reluctantly the landlord tells a story which happened in the time of his grandfather ninety-two years before. Two men determined to go at night and have a free hunt in the woods upon the estate. They are warned: ""No, do not go; we are sure you will meet with persons walking who should not be walking. They should be resting, not walking."" The two men laughed and cried: ""The Count is dead; we do not care for him."" But in the night the villagers ""hear someone scream, just as if the most inside part of his soul was twisted out of him."" Then they hear a hideous laugh, ""it was not one of those two men that laughed, and, indeed, they have all of them said that it was not any man at all."" In the morning they go out with the priest, and they find one of the men dead, killed in so terrible a fashion that they buried him on the spot. ""He was once a beautiful man, but now his face was not there, because the flesh of it was sucked away off the bones."" The other man is standing with his back against a tree, ""pushing with his hands-pushing something away from him which was not there.""
There was some vague gossip that the Count had been ""on the Black Pilgrimage, and had brought something or someone back with him."" During his investigation of the papers the English traveller, Mr. Wraxall, found a Liber nigrae peregrinationis, or at least a few lines of such a document indicating that the Count had once journeyed to the city of Chorazin and there adored the prince of the air. In careless mood as he is passing near the mausoleum, Mr. Wraxall exclaims: ""Ah, Count Magnus, there you are. I should dearly like to see you."" He is indiscreet enough to cry out thus flippantly on two further occasions, and at last he is thoroughly alarmed by hearing the sound of metal hinges creaking and he knows that the sarcophagus is slowly opening wide. In a state of frenzied fear he sets out for England the next day, yet turn and double as he will he is everywhere haunted by two hideous figures, a man in a long black cloak and a broad-leafed hat and something in a dark cloak and hood. Upon landing at Harwich he makes his way across country to a neighbouring village, when on looking out of the carriage window he sees at a cross-road the two horrible creatures. He finds a lodging, but within the next forty-eight hours his pursuers fall upon him. He is discovered dead, and in the district it is still remembered how ""the jury that viewed the body fainted, seven of 'em did, and none of 'em wouldn't speak to what they see, and the verdict was visitation of God; and how the people as kep' the 'ouse moved out that same week and went away from that part.""
This story may, I think, certainly be considered as Vampire lore, and although it must, of course, be perfectly familiar to all who delight in tales of the supernatural I have related it at some little length here, partly because it is told so excellently well, and partly because it so admirably fulfils and exemplifies the qualities that this kind of literature should possess. It is brief and succinct, although there are many details, but every touch tells. No ghost story should be of any length. The horror and the awe evaporate with prolixity. The ghost is malevolent and odious. In fiction a helpful apparition is a notable weakness, and the whole narrative becomes flabby to a degree. The authentic note of horror is struck in the eerie suggestion which, as we have noticed, is of intent left ill-defined. Nothing could be more crude than an explanation, and it is this banality that often ruins a story which otherwise might be of the very first order.
To review the traces of vampire legends which appear in sagas, and which are in truth but few and unimportant, seems to be outside our province here, and even more foreign to our purpose would be the present examination of the vampire legend in folk-lore since this has already been dealt with in the course of the preceding chapters, and to regard such traditions merely as literature would be not only to look at them from a wrong perspective but to misrepresent their quality and essentially to pervert their purpose.
Since some point must be chosen at which to consider vampirism in literature we may most fairly recall to mind the many academic and philosophical treatises upon the Vampire which were rehearsed and discussed in German Universities during the earlier part of the eighteenth century, and these startling themes soon began to attract the attention of poets and literary men. Thus among the poems of Heinrich August Ossenfelder we have a short piece entitled Der Vampir, which is as follows:
Mein liebes M√§gdchen glaubet
Best√§ndig steif und feste,
An die gegebnen Lehren
Der immer frommen Mutter
Als V√∂lker an der Theyse
An t√∂dtliche Vampiere
Heyduckisch feste glauben,
Nun warte nur Christianchen,
Du willst mich gar nich lieben;
Ich will mich an dir r√§chen,
Und heute in Tockayer
Zu einem Vampir trinken.
Und wenn du sanfte schlummerst,
Von deinen sch√∂nen Wangen
Den frischen Purpur saugen.
Alsdenn wirst du erschrecken,
Wenn ich dich werde k√ºssen
Und als ein Vampir k√ºssen:
Wann du dann recht erzitterst
Und matt in meine Arme,
Gleich einer Todten sinkest
Alsdenn will ich dich fragen,
Sind meine Lehren besser,
Als deiner guten Mutter?
The poet Wieland has a passing reference to the Vampire
Der J√ºngling aus den Wolken
Herab gefallen, stumm und bleich,
Als h√§tt' ein Vampyr ihm die Adern ausgemolken,
Steht ganz vernichtet von dem Streich.
It would be an exaggeration to say that the Vampire entered German literature with Goethe's famous ballad Die Braut von Korinth, but it would be difficult to over-estimate the influence and the popularity of this piece, the subject of which is directly derived from Phlegon of Tralles. The young Athenian who visits his father's old friend to whose daughter he has been betrothed receives at midnight the Vampire body of the girl whom death has prevented from becoming his bride, and who declares:
Aus dem Grabe werd' ich ausgetrieben,
Noch zu suchen das vermifste Gut,
Noch den schon verlornen Mann zu lieben Und zu saugen seines Herzens Blut.
Ist's um den geschehn,
Muss nach andern gehn,
Und das junge Volk erliegt der Wut.
Even more famous are the charnel horrors of B√ºrger's Lenore which was first printed in 1773 in the Gottinger Musenalmanach and which notwithstanding the legions of hostile comments and parodies whereof Brandl gives an ample list has remained a household word.
In spite of the immense enthusiasm at that date in contemporary England for German romantic literature it is remarkable that no translation of Lenore was published here until 1796, when William Taylor of Norwich printed in the Monthly Review of March his rendering which in some respects must be called an adaptation. He had, however, by his own account written the translation as early as 1790, and there can be no doubt that very shortly after its completion it was declaimed, applauded and much discussed in Norwich literary circles. We know that Mrs. Barbauld who visited Edinburgh ""about the summer of 1793 or 1794"" read aloud Taylor's version to a number of enthusiastic admirers. This event was described to Sir Walter Scott by Miss Cranstoun, afterwards Countess Purgstall, although Scott himself mentions that his curiosity ""was first attracted to this truly romantic story by a gentleman, who, having heard Lenore once read in manuscript, could only recollect the general outline, and part of a couplet, which, from the singularity of its structure, and frequent recurrence, had remained impressed on his memory."" This gentleman Was Mr. Cranstoun, the brother of Countess Purgstall, and so her statement is no doubt accurate as Scott might well have received his account both from the brother as well as from the sister. It was in the course of 1794, or at any rate early in the following year that Scott made his own rendering of the ballad. The account of Taylor's version, Ellenore, which ""electrified"" the assembled company at Dugald Stewart's house when read by the famous Anna Letitia Barbauld had given him the strongest desire to see the original. Just about this time, however, it was a difficult matter to procure books from the continent, and it was not until after some delay that a copy of B√ºrger's works was conveyed to him from Hamburg. He immediately devoured the German ballad and was so impressed that he forthwith set about Englishing it. ""I well recollect"" he writes, ""that I began my task after supper, and finished it about daybreak next morning."" Scott's friends privately printed a few copies of the poem as a surprise for the author,"" and as it went from hand to hand it met with the most flattering reception. In 1796, besides the public issue of the translations from B√ºrger by Taylor and by Scott, no less than three other versions appeared, from the several pens of W. R. Spencer, H. J. Pye and J. T. Stanley. The translation by the last named author was given to the public in an √©dition de luxe at five shillings, as well as in the ordinary edition of half a crown. In 1797, a pasquil followed, Miss Kitty: a Parody on Lenora, a Ballad, ""Translated from the German, by several Hands,"" whilst in the following year, Mrs. Taylor turned the popular poem into Italian as a ""Novella Morale."" Probably the most faithful, if not the most spirited translation, was that by the Rev. J. Beresford which was published in 1800.
It was in 1797 that Coleridge wrote the first part of Christabel, and German critics have somewhat superfluously endeavoured to emphasize herein the influence of Lenore, since upon examination it would hardly seem that such is present even in the smallest degree. For example, if the narrative of Geraldine be carefully read it must be evident that the following judgment of Professor Brandl is without foundation. This critic writes: ""Ihre Vorgeschichte (of Geraldine) sch√∂pfte er grossentheils aus B√ºrgers 'Lenore' in Taylors Uebersetzung: die Dame ist, wenigstens ihrer Erz√§hlung nach, auf einem windschnellen Ross entf√ºhrt und halbtodt vor Furcht hier abgesetzt worden; statt des schwarzen Leichenzuges, der Lenoren auf ihrem Ritt durch die Mondnacht aufstiess, will sie 'den Schatten der Nacht' gekreuzt haben; noch zittert das verdorrte Blatt neben ihr wie aus Herzenangst.""
As we might expect, the young Shelley was enchanted by Lenore, and Medwin relates how the poet long treasured cc a copy of the whole poem, which he made with his own hand."" Dowden tells the story how one Christmas Eve Shelley dramatically related the B√ºrger ballad with appropriate intonation and gesture ""working up the horror to such a height of fearful interest ""that the company fully expected to see Wilhelm stalk into the parlour."" In his study of Shelley, Charles Middleton has remarked: ""It is hinted, somewhat plausibly, that the Leonora of B√ºrgher first awakened his poetic faculty. A tale of such beauty and terror might well have kindled his lively imagination, but his earliest pieces, written about this time, and consisting only of a few ballads, are deficient in elegance and originality, and give no evidence whatever of the genius which soon after declared itself."" To suggest, as Zeiger would have it, that Lenore influenced the poem which in the romance St. Irvyne Megalina inscribes on the wall of her prison, and which commences:
Ghosts of the dead! have I not heard your yelling
Rise on the night-rolling breast of the blast, . . .
is the merest ineptitude, since these verses are taken almost word for word from ""Lachin y Gair"" in Byron's Hours of Idleness, and that had been published some four years previously.
As I have elsewhere shown in some detail, Shelley's two juvenile romances owe not only their inspiration but a great deal of their phrasing and noctivagations to Charlotte Dacre's Zofloya: or The Moor, which appeared in 1806, and which, as the poet himself declares ""quite enraptured"" him. It is a very remarkable circumstance that in spite of the extremely plain hint which might profitably have been taken from such poems as Die Braut von Korinth and Lenore the novelists of the Gothic school, soaked though they were in German literature, searching the earth and the depths of the earth for thrills and sensation of every kind, do not seem to have utilized the tradition of the Vampire. It is a puzzle indeed if we ask how it was that such writers as Monk Lewis, ""Apollo's sexton,"" who would fain ""make Parnassus a churchyard""; and Charles Robert Maturin who, as he himself confessed, loved bells rung by viewless hands, daggers encrusted with long shed blood, treacherous doors behind still more treacherous tapestry, mad nuns, apparitions, et hoc genus omne; the two lords of macabre romance, should neither of them have sent some hideous vampire ghost ravening through their sepulchral pages. In the Gothic romance we have horror heaped on horror's head; mouldering abbeys, haunted castles, banditti, illuminati, sorcerers, conspirators, murderous monks and phantom friars, apparitions without number until the despairing reviewers cried aloud: ""Surely the misses themselves must be tired of so many stories of ghosts and murders."" We have such titles as the famous Horrid Mysteries; The Midnight Groan; The Abbot of Montserrat, or, The Pool of Blood; The Demon of Venice; The Convent Spectre; The Hag of the Mountains; and a hundred such lurid nomenclatures, but until we come to Polidori's novel which will be considered later, nowhere, so far as I am aware, do we meet with the Vampire in the realm of Gothic fancy. So vast, however, is this fascinating library and so difficult to procure are these novels of a century and a quarter ago that I hesitate sweepingly to assert that this theme was entirely unexploited. There may be some romance which I have not had the good fortune to find where a hideous vampire swoops down upon his victims, but if such be the case I am at least prepared to say that the Vampire was not generally known to Gothic lore, and had his presence made itself felt in the sombre chapters of one votary of this school I think he would have re-appeared on many occasions, for the writers were as accustomed to convey from one another with an easy assurance, as they were wont deftly to plunder the foreign mines. Inevitably one of the band, T. J. Horseley Carties, Francis Lathom, William Herbert, Edward Montague, Mrs. Roche, Eliza Parsons, Miss M. Hamilton, Mrs. Helme, Mrs. Meeke, Isabella Kelley, and many another beside insatiably agog for horrid phantasmagoria would have utilized the Vampire in some funereal episode.
One might even have supposed that the notes to Southey's Thalaba the Destroyer, must have put them on the track, and surely stanzas eight, nine and ten in Book VIII could not have passed unnoticed:
A night of darkness and of storms!
Into the Chamber of the Tomb
Thalaba led the Old Man,
To roof him from the rain.
A night of storms! the wind
Swept through the moonless sky,
And moan'd among the pillar'd sepulchres;
And in the pauses if its sweep
They heard the heavy rain
Beat on the monument above.
In silence on Oneiza's grave
Her father and her husband sate.
The Cryer from the Minaret
Proclaim'd the midnight hour.
""Now, now!"" cried Thalaba;
And o'er the chamber of the tomb
There spread a lurid gleam,
Like the reflection of a sulphur fire
And in that hideous light
Oneiza stood before them. It was She . . .
Her very lineaments. . . . and such as death
Had changed them, livid cheeks and lips of blue;
But in her eye there dwelt
Brightness more terrible
Than all the loathsomeness of death.
""Still art thou living, wretch? ""
In hollow tones she cried to Thalaba;
""And must I nightly leave my grave
To tell thee, still in vain,
God hath abandoned thee?
""This is not she!"" the Old Man exclaim'd;
""A Fiend; a manifest Fiend!""
And to the youth he held his lance;
""Strike and deliver thyself!""
""Strike HER!"" cried Thalaba,
And palsied of all power,
Gazed fixedly upon the dreadful form.
""Yea, strike her!"" cried a voice, whose tones
Flow'd with such a sudden healing through his soul,
As when the desert shower
From death deliver'd him;
But obedient to that well-known voice,
His eye was seeking it,
When Moath, firm of heart,
Perform 'd the bidding: through the vampire corpse
He thrust his lance; it fell,
And howling with the wound,
Its fiendish tenant fled.
A sapphire light fell on them,
And garmented with glory, in their sight
Oneiza's spirit stood.
It is important to remark that in his notes upon this passage Southey cites at considerable length various cases of vampirism, particularly from the Lettres Juives, the Vampires of Gradisch, also the history of Arnold Paul, and the very ample account given by Tournefort. He further says: ""The Turks have an opinion that men that are buried have a sort of life in their graves. If any man makes affidavit before a judge, that he heard a noise in a man's grave, he  is, by order, dug up and chopped all too pieces. The merchants (at Constantinople) once airing on horseback, had, as usual, for protection, a Janisary with them. Passing by the burying place of the Jews, it happened that an old Jew sat by a sepulchre. The Janisary rode up to him, and rated him for stinking the world a second time, and commanded him to get into his grave again--Roger North's Life of Sir Dudley North.""
It might perhaps not unfairly be argued that the two notorious romances of the Marquis de Sade Justine, on les Malheurs de la Vertu and Juliette depict scenes of vampirism, and if we are to take the word in any extended sense this is certainly the case. In the first place it must be remembered that as it passed through various editions-it was first issued in 1791, 2 vols., 8vo,--until it appeared in its final and complete form in 1797 as La Nouvelle Justine, on les Malheurs de la Vertu, suivie de l'Histoire de Juliette, sa soeur, 10 vols., 18mo (of which Justine occupies four and Juliette six) Justine was added to and augmented until the last version is practically double the length of the first, and the book has been entirely re-written. In Justine we have the episodes in the house of Monsieur Rodin, and more particularly the orgies of the Comte de Gernade who takes a lustful pleasure in watching the blood flow from the veins of his victims, as also the cruelties of the monster Roland all of which. may well be esteemed vampirism. Many similar scenes are described with great prolixity in Juliette, and this romance is distinguished by such horrible figures as the Muscovite giant Minski, whose favourite meat is human flesh, and in whose castle the table and chairs are made of bleaching bones, and Cordelli, the necrophilist of Ancona.
In The New Monthly Magazine, 1 April, 1819, was published The Vampyre: a Tale by Lord Byron, which although it may seem to us--steeped in Le Fanu and M. R. James--a little old-fashioned, at the time created an immense sensation and had the most extraordinary influence, being even more admired and imitated on the Continent than in England. It was almost immediately known that actually the story did not come from the pen of Lord Byron, but had been written by Dr. John William Polidori, physician-companion to the poet. Byron had, as a matter of fact, been writing a work of the same title in imitation of Mrs. Shelley's Frankenstein, but he denied the authorship of this piece in the famous letter facsimilied in Galignani's edition of his works. A first printed, The Vampyre forms a part of extracts from ""A letter from Geneva, with Anecdotes of Lord Byron."" Here is to be read that ""among other things which the lady, from whom I procured these anecdotes, related to me, she mentioned the outline of a ghost story by Lord Byron. It appears that one evening Lord Byron, Mr. p. B. Shelley, the two ladies and the gentleman (the daughters of Godwin and Dr. Polidori) before alluded to after having perused a German work, which was entitled Phantasmagoriana began relating ghost stories; when his lordship having recited the beginning of Christabel, then unpublished, the whole took so strong a hold of Mr. Shelley's mind, that he suddenly started up and ran out of the room. The physician and Lord Byron followed, and discovered him leaning against a mantlepiece with cold drops of perspiration trickling down his face. After having given him something to refresh him, upon enquiring into the cause of his alarm, they found that his wild imagination having pictured to him the bosom of one of the ladies with eyes (which was reported of a lady in the neighbourhood where he lived) he was obliged to leave the room in order to destroy the impression. It was afterwards proposed in the course of conversation, that each of the company present should write a tale depending upon some supernatural agency, which was undertaken by Lord Byron, the physician, and Miss M. Godwin. My friend, the lady above referred to, had in her possession the outline of each of these stories, I obtained them as a great favour, and herewith forward them to you, as I was assured you would feel as much curiosity as myself, to peruse the √©bauches of so great a genius, and those immediately under his influence."" Upon this the Editor has the following note: ""We have in our possession the Tale of Dr. ------ as well as the outline of that of Miss Godwin. The latter has already appeared under the title of 'Frankenstein, or the modern Prometheus'; the former, however, upon consulting this author, we may, probably, hereafter give to our readers.""
The Vampyre is introduced by several paragraphs which deal with the tradition. This preamble commences: ""The superstition upon which this tale is founded is very general in the East. Among the Arabians it appears to be common; it did not, however, extend itself to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has only assumed its present form since the division of the Latin and Greek churches; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, that a Latin body could not corrupt if buried in their territory, it gradually increased, and formed the subject of many wonderful stories, still extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the blood of the young and beautiful. In the West it spread, with some slight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the belief existed, that vampyres nightly imbibed a certain portion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and speedily died of consumptions; whilst these human bloodsuckers fattened--and their veins became distended to such a state of repletion as to cause the blood to flow from all the passages of their bodies, and even from the very pores of their skins.""
The Editor then recounts the famous instance of Arnold Paul, and continues: ""We have related this monstrous rodomontade, because it seems better adapted to illustrate the subject of the present observations than any other instance we could adduce. In many parts of Greece it is considered as a sort of punishment after death, for some heinous crime committed whilst in existence, that the deceased is doomed to vampyrise, but be compelled to confine his visitations solely to those beings he loved most while on earth-those to whom he was bound by ties of kindred and affection. This supposition is, we imagine, alluded to in the following fearfully sublime and prophetic curse from the 'Giaour.'
But first on earth, as Vampyre sent,
Thy corse shall from its tomb be rent;
Then ghastly haunt thy native place,
And suck the blood of all thy race;
There from thy daughter, sister, wife, p. 283
At midnight drain the stream of life;
Yet loathe the banquet, which perforce
Must feed thy livid living corse,
Thy victims, ere they yet expire,
Shall know the demon for their sire;
As cursing thee, thou cursing them,
Thy flowers are withered on the stem.
But one that for thy crime must fall,
The youngest, best beloved of all,
Shall bless thee with a father's name--
That word shall wrap thy heart in flame!
Yet thou must end thy task and mark
Her check's last tinge--her eye's last spark,
And the last glassy glance must view
Which freezes o'er its lifeless blue;
Then with unhallowed hand shall tear
The tresses of her yellow hair,
Of which, in life a lock when shorn
Affection's fondest pledge was worn--
But now is borne away by thee
Memorial o thine agony!
Yet with thine own best blood shall drip
Thy gnashing tooth, and haggard lip;
Then stalking to thy sullen grave
Go--and with Ghouls and Afrits rave,
Till these in horror shrink away
From spectre more accursed than they.""
After an allusion to Southey's Thalaba, Tournefort's Travels, and Dom Calmet's classical work, the editor concludes: ""We could add many curious and interesting notices on this singularly horrible superstition, and we may, perhaps, resume our observations upon it at some future opportunity; for the present, we feel that we have very far exceeded the limits of a note, necessarily devoted to the explanation of the strange production to which we now invite the attention of our readers; and we shall therefore conclude by merely remarking, that though the term Vampyre is the one in most general acceptation, there are several other synonimous with it, which are made use of in various parts of the world, namely, Vroucolocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.""
The story tells how at the height of a London season there appeared at the various parties of the leaders of the ton a nobleman, more remarkable for his singularities, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he could not participate therein. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair only attracted his attention that he might by a look quell it, and throw fear into those breasts where thoughtlessness reigned. Those who felt this sensation of awe, could not explain whence it arose; some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which fixing upon the object's face, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glance to pierce through to the inward working of the heart; but fell upon the cheek with a leaden ray that weighed upon the skin it could not pass."" This original is invited to every house, and in the course of the winter he meets ""a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey"" he was an orphan left with an only sister in the possession of great wealth, by parents who died while he was yet in childhood."" Aubrey is greatly fascinated by Lord Ruthven, for this is the name of the mysterious nobleman, and intending to travel upon the Continent he mentions this intention to my Lord, and is ""surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattered by such a mark of esteem from him who, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circling waters.""
As they travelled from town to town, Aubrey notices the peculiar conduct of his companion who bestows largess upon the most worthless characters, broken gamblers and the like, but refuses a doit to the deserving and virtuous poor. However the recipients of this charity ""inevitably found that there was a curse upon it, for they all were either led to the scaffold or sunk to the lowest and the most abject misery."" Eventually the travellers arrive at Rome, and here Aubrey receives letters from his guardians who require him immediately to leave his companion as since their departure from London the most terrible scandals, adulteries and seductions, have come to light. At Rome Aubrey is able to foil Lord Ruthven's plans, frustrating an intrigue designed to ruin a heedless young girl, and then he ""directed his steps towards Greece, and, crossing the Peninsula, soon found himself at Athens."" Here he lodges in the house of a Greek, whose daughter Ianthe is a paragon of the most exquisite beauty. As he sketches the ruins of the city she is wont to entertain him with Greek legend and tradition, and ""often, as she told him the tale of the living vampyre, who had passed years amidst his friends, and dearest ties, forced every year, by feeding upon the life of a lovely female to prolong his existence for the ensuing months, his blood would run cold, whilst he attempted to laugh her out of such idle and horrible fantasies; but Ianthe cited to him the names of old men, who had at last detected one living among themselves, after several of their relatives and children had been found marked with the stamp of the fiend's appetite; and when she found him so incredulous, she begged of him to believe her, for it had been remarked, that those who had dared to question their existence, always had some proof given, which obliged them, with grief and heart-breaking to confess it was true. She detailed to him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and his horror was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate description of Lord Ruthven; he, however, still persisted in persuading her, that there could be no truth in her fears, though at the same time he wondered at the many coincidences which had all tended to excite a belief in the supernatural power of Lord Ruthven.""
Before long it becomes evident that Aubrey is in love with Ianthe, ""and while he ridicules the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, still he found himself more and more attached to the almost fairy form before him."" He endeavours to occupy his time with antiquarian excursions which lead him farther and farther afield, and at length he determines to proceed to a point beyond any he has as yet visited. When Ianthe's parents hear the name of the place he proposes to visit they most earnestly implore him on no account to return when once dusk has fallen, ""as he must necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever remain after the day had closed, upon any consideration. They described it as the resort of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced the most heavy evils as impending upon him who dared to cross their path. Aubrey made light of their representations, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring thus to mock a superior, the very name of which apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent.""
Having given his promise to Ianthe that he will be back well before evening he sets out very early. The exploration, however, takes longer than he has supposed, and when he turns his horse homeward the darkness is already hurrying on urged by a terrific storm. The steed, alarmed at the battle of the elements dashes off at breakneck pace and only halts trembling and t",en,LABEL_0,0.45422983169555664,LABEL_1,0.5457701683044434

Now we saw countless sails of mackerel fishers abroad on the deep, one fleet in the north just pouring round the Cape, another standing down toward Chatham, and our host‚Äôs son went off to join some lagging member of the first which had not yet left the Bay
Before we left the light-house we were obliged to anoint our shoes faithfully with tallow, for walking on the beach, in the salt water and the sand, had turned them red and crisp. To counterbalance this, I have remarked that the seashore, even where muddy, as it is not here, is singularly clean; for notwithstanding the spattering of the water and mud and squirting of the clams while walking to and from the boat, your best black pants retain no stain nor dirt, such as they would acquire from walking in the country
We have heard that a few days after this, when the Provincetown Bank was robbed, speedy emissaries from Provincetown made particular inquiries concerning us at this light-house. Indeed, they traced us all the way down the Cape, and concluded that we came by this unusual route down the back-side and on foot, in order that we might discover a way to get off with our booty when we had committed the robbery. The Cape is so long and narrow, and so bare withal, that it is wellnigh impossible for a stranger to visit it without the knowledge of its inhabitants generally, unless he is wrecked on to it in the night. So, when this robbery occurred, all their suspicions seem to have at once centred on us two travellers who had just passed down it. If we had not chanced to leave the Cape so soon, we should probably have been arrested. The real robbers were two young men from Worcester County who travelled with a centre-bit, and are said to have done their work very neatly. But the only bank that we pried into was the great Cape Cod sand-bank, and we robbed it only of an old French crown piece, some shells and pebbles, and the materials of this story
Again we took to the beach for another day (October 13), walking along the shore of the resounding sea, determined to get it into us. We wished to associate with the Ocean until it lost the pond-like look which it wears to a country-man. We still thought that we could see the other side. Its surface was still more sparkling than the day before, and we beheld ‚Äúthe countless smilings of the ocean waves‚Äù; though some of them were pretty broad grins, for still the wind blew and the billows broke in foam along the beach. The nearest beach to us on the other side, whither we looked, due east, was on the coast of Galicia, in Spain, whose capital is Santiago, though by old poets‚Äô reckoning it should have been Atlantis or the Hesperides; but heaven is found to be farther west now. At first we were abreast of that part of Portugal entre Douro e Mino, and then Galicia and the port of Pontevedra opened to us as we walked along; but we did not enter, the breakers ran so high. The bold headland of Cape Finisterre, a little north of east, jutted toward us next, with its vain brag, for we flung back,‚Äî‚ÄúHere is Cape Cod,‚ÄîCape Land‚Äôs-Beginning.‚Äù A little indentation toward the north,‚Äîfor the land loomed to our imaginations by a common mirage,‚Äîwe knew was the Bay of Biscay, and we sang:‚Äî
‚ÄúThere we lay, till next day
In the Bay of Biscay O!‚Äù
A little south of east was Palos, where Columbus weighed anchor, and farther yet the pillars which Hercules set up; concerning which when we inquired at the top of our voices what was written on them,‚Äîfor we had the morning sun in our faces, and could not see distinctly,‚Äîthe inhabitants shouted Ne plus ultra (no more beyond), but the wind bore to us the truth only, plus ultra (more beyond), and over the Bay westward was echoed ultra (beyond). We spoke to them through the surf about the Far West, the true Hesperia, ·ºïœâ œÄ·Ω≥œÅŒ±œÇ or end of the day, the This Side Sundown, where the sun was extinguished in the Pacific, and we advised them to pull up stakes and plant those pillars of theirs on the shore of California, whither all our folks were gone,‚Äîthe only ne plus ultra now. Whereat they looked crestfallen on their cliffs, for we had taken the wind out of all their sails
We could not perceive that any of their leavings washed up here, though we picked up a child‚Äôs toy, a small dismantled boat, which may have been lost at Pontevedra
The Cape became narrower and narrower as we approached its wrist between Truro and Provincetown, and the shore inclined more decidedly to the west. At the head of East Harbor Creek, the Atlantic is separated but by half a dozen rods of sand from the tide-waters of the Bay. From the Clay Pounds the bank flatted off for the last ten miles to the extremity at Race Point, though the highest parts, which are called ‚Äúislands‚Äù from their appearance at a distance on the sea, were still seventy or eighty feet above the Atlantic, and afforded a good view of the latter, as well as a constant view of the Bay, there being no trees nor a hill sufficient to interrupt it. Also the sands began to invade the land more and more, until finally they had entire possession from sea to sea, at the narrowest part. For three or four miles between Truro and Provincetown there were no inhabitants from shore to shore, and there were but three or four houses for twice that distance
As we plodded along, either by the edge of the ocean, where the sand was rapidly drinking up the last wave that wet it, or over the sand-hills of the bank, the mackerel fleet continued to pour round the Cape north of us, ten or fifteen miles distant, in countless numbers, schooner after schooner, till they made a city on the water. They were so thick that many appeared to be afoul of one another; now all standing on this tack, now on that. We saw how well the New-Englanders had followed up Captain John Smith‚Äôs suggestions with regard to the fisheries, made in 1616,‚Äîto what a pitch they had carried ‚Äúthis contemptible trade of fish,‚Äù as he significantly styles it, and were now equal to the Hollanders whose example he holds up for the English to emulate; notwithstanding that ‚Äúin this faculty,‚Äù as he says, ‚Äúthe former are so naturalized, and of their vents so certainly acquainted, as there is no likelihood they will ever be paralleled, having two or three thousand busses, flat-bottoms, sword-pinks, todes, and such like, that breeds them sailors, mariners, soldiers, and merchants, never to be wrought out of that trade and fit for any other.‚Äù We thought that it would take all these names and more to describe the numerous craft which we saw. Even then, some years before our ‚Äúrenowned sires‚Äù with their ‚Äúpeerless dames‚Äù stepped on Plymouth Rock, he wrote, ‚ÄúNewfoundland doth yearly freight neir eight hundred sail of ships with a silly, lean, skinny, poor-john, and cor fish,‚Äù though all their supplies must be annually transported from Europe. Why not plant a colony here then, and raise those supplies on the spot? ‚ÄúOf all the four parts of the world,‚Äù says he, ‚Äúthat I have yet seen, not inhabited, could I have but means to transport a colony, I would rather live here than anywhere. And if it did not maintain itself, were we but once indifferently well fitted, let us starve.‚Äù Then ‚Äúfishing before your doors,‚Äù you ‚Äúmay every night sleep quietly ashore, with good cheer and what fires you will, or, when you please, with your wives and family.‚Äù Already he anticipates ‚Äúthe new towns in New England in memory of their old,‚Äù‚Äîand who knows what may be discovered in the ‚Äúheart and entrails‚Äù of the land, ‚Äúseeing even the very edges,‚Äù etc., etc
All this has been accomplished, and more, and where is Holland now? Verily the Dutch have taken it. There was no long interval between the suggestion of Smith and the eulogy of Burke
You might also likeStill one after another the mackerel schooners hove in sight round the head of the Cape, ‚Äúwhitening all the sea road,‚Äù and we watched each one for a moment with an undivided interest. It seemed a pretty sport. Here in the country it is only a few idle boys or loafers that go a-fishing on a rainy day; but there it appeared as if every able-bodied man and helpful boy in the Bay had gone out on a pleasure excursion in their yachts, and all would at last land and have a chowder on the Cape. The gazetteer tells you gravely how many of the men and boys of these towns are engaged in the whale, cod, and mackerel fishery, how many go to the banks of Newfoundland, or the coast of Labrador, the Straits of Belle Isle or the Bay of Chaleurs (Shalore the sailors call it); as if I were to reckon up the number of boys in Concord who are engaged during the summer in the perch, pickerel, bream, hornpout, and shiner fishery, of which no one keeps the statistics,‚Äîthough I think that it is pursued with as much profit to the moral and intellectual man (or boy), and certainly with less danger to the physical one
One of my playmates, who was apprenticed to a printer, and was somewhat of a wag, asked his master one afternoon if he might go a-fishing, and his master consented. He was gone three months. When he came back, he said that he had been to the Grand Banks, and went to setting type again as if only an afternoon had intervened
I confess I was surprised to find that so many men spent their whole day, ay, their whole lives almost, a-fishing. It is remarkable what a serious business men make of getting their dinners, and how universally shiftlessness and a grovelling taste take refuge in a merely ant-like industry. Better go without your dinner, I thought, than be thus everlastingly fishing for it like a cormorant. Of course, viewed from the shore, our pursuits in the country appear not a whit less frivolous
I once sailed three miles on a mackerel cruise myself. It was a Sunday evening after a very warm day in which there had been frequent thunder-showers, and I had walked along the shore from Cohasset to Duxbury. I wished to get over from the last place to Clark‚Äôs Island, but no boat could stir, they said, at that stage of the tide, they being left high on the mud. At length I learned that the tavern-keeper, Winsor, was going out mackerelling with seven men that evening, and would take me. When there had been due delay, we one after another straggled down to the shore in a leisurely manner, as if waiting for the tide still, and in India-rubber boots, or carrying our shoes in our hands, waded to the boats, each of the crew bearing an armful of wood, and one a bucket of new potatoes besides. Then they resolved that each should bring one more armful of wood, and that would be enough. They had already got a barrel of water, and had some more in the schooner. We shoved the boats a dozen rods over the mud and water till they floated, then rowing half a mile to the vessel climbed aboard, and there we were in a mackerel schooner, a fine stout vessel of forty-three tons, whose name I forget. The baits were not dry on the hooks. There was the mill in which they ground the mackerel, and the trough to hold it, and the long-handled dipper to cast it overboard with; and already in the harbor we saw the surface rippled with schools of small mackerel, the real Scomber vernalis. The crew proceeded leisurely to weigh anchor and raise their two sails, there being a fair but very slight wind;‚Äîand the sun now setting clear and shining on the vessel after the thundershowers, I thought that I could not have commenced the voyage under more favorable auspices. They had four dories and commonly fished in them, else they fished on the starboard side aft where their fines hung ready, two to a man. The boom swung round once or twice, and Winsor cast overboard the foul juice of mackerel mixed with rain-water which remained in his trough, and then we gathered about the helmsman and told stories. I remember that the compass was affected by iron in its neighborhood and varied a few degrees. There was one among us just returned from California, who was now going as passenger for his health and amusement. They expected to be gone about a week, to begin fishing the next morning, and to carry their fish fresh to Boston. They landed me at Clark‚Äôs Island, where the Pilgrims landed, for my companions wished to get some milk for the voyage. But I had seen the whole of it. The rest was only going to sea and catching the mackerel. Moreover, it was as well that I did not remain with them, considering the small quantity of supplies they had taken
Now I saw the mackerel fleet on its fishing-ground, though I was not at first aware of it. So my experience was complete
It was even more cold and windy to-day than before, and we were frequently glad to take shelter behind a sand-hill. None of the elements were resting. On the beach there is a ceaseless activity, always something going on, in storm and in calm, winter and summer, night and day. Even the sedentary man here enjoys a breadth of view which is almost equivalent to motion. In clear weather the laziest may look across the Bay as far as Plymouth at a glance, or over the Atlantic as far as human vision reaches, merely raising his eyelids; or if he is too lazy to look after all, he can hardly help hearing the ceaseless dash and roar of the breakers. The restless ocean may at any moment cast up a whale or a wrecked vessel at your feet. All the reporters in the world, the most rapid stenographers, could not report the news it brings. No creature could move slowly where there was so much life around. The few wreckers were either going or coming, and the ships and the sand-pipers, and the screaming gulls overhead; nothing stood still but the shore. The little beach-birds trotted past close to the water‚Äôs edge, or paused but an instant to swallow their food, keeping time with the elements. I wondered how they ever got used to the sea, that they ventured so near the waves. Such tiny inhabitants the land brought forth! except one fox. And what could a fox do, looking on the Atlantic from that high bank? What is the sea to a fox? Sometimes we met a wrecker with his cart and dog,‚Äîand his dog‚Äôs faint bark at us wayfarers, heard through the roaring of the surf, sounded ridiculously faint. To see a little trembling dainty-footed cur stand on the margin of the ocean, and ineffectually bark at a beach-bird, amid the roar of the Atlantic! Come with design to bark at a whale, perchance! That sound will do for farmyards. All the dogs looked out of place there, naked and as if shuddering at the vastness; and I thought that they would not have been there had it not been for the countenance of their masters. Still less could you think of a cat bending her steps that way, and shaking her wet foot over the Atlantic; yet even this happens sometimes, they tell me. In summer I saw the tender young of the Piping Plover, like chickens just hatched, mere pinches of down on two legs, running in troops, with a faint peep, along the edge of the waves. I used to see packs of half-wild dogs haunting the lonely beach on the south shore of Staten Island, in New York Bay, for the sake of the carrion there cast up; and I remember that once, when for a long time I had heard a furious barking in the tall grass of the marsh, a pack of half a dozen large dogs burst forth on to the beach, pursuing a little one which ran straight to me for protection, and I afforded it with some stones, though at some risk to myself; but the next day the little one was the first to bark at me. under these circumstances I could not but remember the words of the poet:‚Äî
‚ÄúBlow, blow, thou winter wind
Thou art not so unkind
As his ingratitude;
Thy tooth is not so keen
Because thou art not seen
Although thy breath be rude
‚ÄúFreeze, freeze, thou bitter sky
Thou dost not bite so nigh
As benefits forgot;
Though thou the waters warp
Thy sting is not so sharp
As friend remembered not.‚Äù
Sometimes, when I was approaching the carcass of a horse or ox which lay on the beach there, where there was no living creature in sight, a dog would unexpectedly emerge from it and slink away with a mouthful of offal
The sea-shore is a sort of neutral ground, a most advantageous point from which to contemplate this world. It is even a trivial place. The waves forever rolling to the land are too far-travelled and untamable to be familiar. Creeping along the endless beach amid the sun-squall and the foam, it occurs to us that we, too, are the product of sea-slime
It is a wild, rank place, and there is no flattery in it. Strewn with crabs, horse-shoes, and razor-clams, and whatever the sea casts up,‚Äîa vast morgue, where famished dogs may range in packs, and crows come daily to glean the pittance which the tide leaves them. The carcasses of men and beasts together lie stately up upon its shelf, rotting and bleaching in the sun and waves, and each tide turns them in their beds, and tucks fresh sand under them. There is naked Nature, inhumanly sincere, wasting no thought on man, nibbling at the cliffy shore where gulls wheel amid the spray
We saw this forenoon what, at a distance, looked like a bleached log with a branch still left on it. It proved to be one of the principal bones of a whale, whose carcass, having been stripped of blubber at sea and cut adrift, had been washed up some months before. It chanced that this was the most conclusive evidence which we met with to prove, what the Copenhagen antiquaries assert, that these shores were the Furdustrandas which Thorhall, the companion of Thorfinn during his expedition to Vinland in 1007. sailed past in disgust. It appears that after they had left the Cape and explored the country about Straum-Fiordr (Buzzards‚Äô Bay!), Thorhall, who was disappointed at not getting any wine to drink there, determined to sail north again in search of Vinland. Though the antiquaries have given us the original Icelandic. I prefer to quote their translation, since theirs is the only Latin which I know to have been aimed at Cape Cod
‚ÄúCum parati erant, sublato
Velo, cecinit Thorhallus:
E√≤ redeamus, ubi conterranei
Sunt nostri! faciamus aliter
Expansi arenosi peritum
Lata navis explorare curricula:
Dum procellam incitantes gladii
Mor√¶ impatientes, qui terram
Collaudant, Furdustrandas
Inhabitant et coquunt bal√¶nas.‚Äù
In other words: ‚ÄúWhen they were ready and their sail hoisted, Thorhall sang: Let us return thither where our fellow-countrymen are. Let us make a bird skilful to fly through the heaven of sand, to explore the broad track of ships; while warriors who impel to the tempest of swords, who praise the land, inhabit Wonder-Strands, and cook whales.‚Äô‚Äù And so he sailed north past Cape Cod, as the antiquaries say, ‚Äúand was shipwrecked on to Ireland.‚Äù
Though once there were more whales cast up here, I think that it was never more wild than now. We do not associate the idea of antiquity with the ocean, nor wonder how it looked a thousand years ago, as we do of the land, for it was equally wild and unfathomable always. The Indians have left no traces on its surface, but it is the same to the civilized man and the savage. The aspect of the shore only has changed. The ocean is a wilderness reaching round the globe, wilder than a Bengal jungle, and fuller of monsters, washing the very wharves of our cities and the gardens of our sea-side residences. Serpents, bears, hyenas, tigers, rapidly vanish as civilization advances, but the most populous and civilized city cannot scare a shark far from its wharves. It is no further advanced than Singapore, with its tigers, in this respect. The Boston papers had never told me that there were seals in the harbor. I had always associated these with the Esquimaux and other outlandish people. Yet from the parlor windows all along the coast you may see families of them sporting on the flats. They were as strange to me as the merman would be. Ladies who never walk in the woods, sail over the sea. To go to sea! Why, it is to have the experience of Noah,‚Äîto realize the deluge. Every vessel is an ark
We saw no fences as we walked the beach, no birchen riders, highest of rails, projecting into the sea to keep the cows from wading round, nothing to remind us that man was proprietor of the shore. Yet a Truro man did tell us that owners of land on the east side of that town were regarded as owning the beach, in order that they might have the control of it so far as to defend themselves against the encroachments of the sand and the beach-grass,‚Äîfor even this friend is sometimes regarded as a foe; but he said that this was not the case on the Bay side. Also I have seen in sheltered parts of the Bay temporary fences running to low-water mark, the posts being set in sills or sleepers placed transversely
After we had been walking many hours, the mackerel fleet still hovered in the northern horizon nearly in the same direction, but farther off, hull down. Though their sails were set they never sailed away, nor yet came to anchor, but stood on various tacks as close together as vessels in a haven, and we in our ignorance thought that they were contending patiently with adverse winds, beating eastward; but we learned afterward that they were even then on their fishing-ground, and that they caught mackerel without taking in their mainsails or coming to anchor, ‚Äúa smart breeze‚Äù (thence called a mackerel breeze) ‚Äúbeing,‚Äù as one says, ‚Äúconsidered most favorable‚Äù for this purpose. We counted about two hundred sail of mackerel fishers within one small arc of the horizon, and a nearly equal number had disappeared southward. Thus they hovered about the extremity of the Cape, like moths round a candle; the lights at Race Point and Long Point being bright candles for them at night,‚Äîand at this distance they looked fair and white, as if they had not yet flown into the light, but nearer at hand afterward, we saw how some had formerly singed their wings and bodies
A village seems thus, where its able-bodied men are all ploughing the ocean together, as a common field. In North Truro the women and girls may sit at their doors, and see where their husbands and brothers are harvesting their mackerel fifteen or twenty miles off, on the sea, with hundreds of white harvest wagons, just as in the country the farmers‚Äô wives sometimes see their husbands working in a distant hillside field. But the sound of no dinner-horn can reach the fisher‚Äôs ear
Having passed the narrowest part of the waist of the Cape, though still in Truro, for this township is about twelve miles long on the shore, we crossed over to the Bay side, not half a mile distant, in order to spend the noon on the nearest shrubby sand-hill in Provincetown, called Mount Ararat, which rises one hundred feet above the ocean. On our way thither we had occasion to admire the various beautiful forms and colors of the sand, and we noticed an interesting mirage, which I have since found that Hitchcock also observed on the sands of the Cape. We were crossing a shallow valley in the Desert, where the smooth and spotless sand sloped upward by a small angle to the horizon on every side, and at the lowest part was a long chain of clear but shallow pools. As we were approaching these for a drink in a diagonal direction across the valley, they appeared inclined at a slight but decided angle to the horizon, though they were plainly and broadly connected with one another, and there was not the least ripple to suggest a current; so that by the time we had reached a convenient part of one we seemed to have ascended several feet. They appeared to lie by magic on the side of the vale, like a mirror left in a slanting position. It was a very pretty mirage for a Provincetown desert, but not amounting to what, in Sanscrit, is called ‚Äúthe thirst of the gazelle,‚Äù as there was real water here for a base, and we were able to quench our thirst after all
Professor Rafn, of Copenhagen, thinks that the mirage which I noticed, but which an old inhabitant of Provincetown, to whom I mentioned it, had never seen nor heard of, had something to do with the name ‚ÄúFurdustrandas,‚Äù i.e. Wonder-Strands, given, as I have said, in the old Icelandic account of Thorfinn‚Äôs expedition to Vinland in the year 1007, to a part of the coast on which he landed. But these sands are more remarkable for their length than for their mirage, which is common to all deserts, and the reason for the name which the Northmen them-selves give,‚Äî‚Äúbecause it took a long time to sail by them,‚Äù‚Äîis sufficient and more applicable to these shores. However, if you should sail all the way from Greenland to Buzzards‚Äô Bay along the coast, you would get sight of a good many sandy beaches. But whether Thorfinn saw the mirage here or not, Thor-eau, one of the same family, did; and perchance it was because Lief the Lucky had, in a previous voyage, taken Thor-er and his people off the rock in the middle of the sea, that Thor-eau was born to see it
This was not the only mirage which I saw on the Cape. That half of the beach next the bank is commonly level, or nearly so, while the other slopes downward to the water. As I was walking upon the edge of the bank in Wellfleet at sundown, it seemed to me that the inside half of the beach sloped upward toward the water to meet the other, forming a ridge ten or twelve feet high the whole length of the shore, but higher always opposite to where I stood; and I was not convinced of the contrary till I descended the bank, though the shaded outlines left by the waves of a previous tide but half-way down the apparent declivity might have taught me better. A stranger may easily detect what is strange to the oldest inhabitant, for the strange is his province. The old oysterman, speaking of gull-shooting, had said that you must aim under, when firing down the bank
A neighbor tells me that one August, looking through a glass from Naushon to some vessels which were sailing along near Martha‚Äôs Vineyard, the water about them appeared perfectly smooth, so that they were reflected in it, and yet their full sails proved that it must be rippled, and they who were with him thought that it was mirage, i.e. a reflection from a haze
From the above-mentioned sand-hill we over-looked Provincetown and its harbor, now emptied of vessels, and also a wide expanse of ocean. As we did not wish to enter Provincetown before night, though it was cold and windy, we returned across the Deserts to the Atlantic side, and walked along the beach again nearly to Race Point, being still greedy of the sea influence. All the while it was not so calm as the reader may suppose, but it was blow, blow, blow,‚Äîroar, roar, roar,‚Äîtramp, tramp, tramp,‚Äîwithout interruption. The shore now trended nearly east and west
Before sunset, having already seen the mackerel fleet returning into the Bay, we left the sea-shore on the north of Provincetown, and made our way across the Desert to the eastern extremity of the town. From the first high sand-hill, covered with beach-grass and bushes to its top, on the edge of the desert, we overlooked the shrubby hill and swamp country which surrounds Provincetown on the north, and protects it, in some measure, from the invading sand. Notwithstanding the universal barrenness, and the contiguity of the desert, I never saw an autumnal landscape so beautifully painted as this was. It was like the richest rug imaginable spread over an uneven surface; no damask nor velvet, nor Tyrian dye or stuffs, nor the work of any loom, could ever match it. There was the incredibly bright red of the Huckleberry, and the reddish brown of the Bayberry, mingled with the bright and living green of small Pitch-Pines, and also the duller green of the Bayberry, Boxberry, and Plum, the yellowish green of the Shrub-oaks, and the various golden and yellow and fawn-colored tints of the Birch and Maple and Aspen,‚Äîeach making its own figure, and, in the midst, the few yellow sand-slides on the sides of the hills looked like the white floor seen through rents in the rug. Coming from the country as I did, and many autumnal woods as I had seen, this was perhaps the most novel and remarkable sight that I saw on the Cape. Probably the brightness of the tints was enhanced by contrast with the sand which surrounded this tract. This was a part of the furniture of Cape Cod. We had for days walked up the long and bleak piazza which runs along her Atlantic side, then over the sanded floor of her halls, and now we were being introduced into her boudoir. The hundred white sails crowding round Long Point into Provincetown Harbor, seen over the painted hills in front, looked like toy ships upon a mantel-piece
The peculiarity of this autumnal landscape consisted in the lowness and thickness of the shrubbery, no less than in the brightness of the tints. It was like a thick stuff of worsted or a fleece, and looked as if a giant could take it up by the hem, or rather the tasselled fringe which trailed out on the sand, and shake it, though it needed not to be shaken. But no doubt the dust would fly in that case, for not a little has accumulated underneath it. Was it not such an autumnal landscape as this which suggested our high-colored rugs and carpets? Hereafter when I look on a richer rug than usual, and study its figures, I shall think, there are the huckleberry hills, and there the denser swamps of boxberry and blueberry: there the shrub-oak patches and the bayberries, there the maples and the birches and the pines. What other dyes are to be compared to these? They were warmer colors than I had associated with the New England coast
After threading a swamp full of boxberry, and climbing several hills covered with shrub-oaks, without a path, where shipwrecked men would be in danger of perishing in the night, we came down upon the eastern extremity of the four planks which run the whole length of Provincetown street. This, which is the last town on the Cape, lies mainly in one street along the curving beach fronting the southeast. The sand-hills, covered with shrubbery and interposed with swamps and ponds, rose immediately behind it in the form of a crescent, which is from half a mile to a mile or more wide in the middle, and beyond these is the desert, which is the greater part of its territory, stretching to the sea on the east and west and north. The town is compactly built in the narrow space, from ten to fifty rods deep, between the harbor and the sand-hills, and contained at that time about twenty-six hundred inhabitants. The houses, in which a more modern and pretending style has at length prevailed over the fisherman‚Äôs hut, stand on the inner or plank side of the street, and the fish and store houses, with the picturesque-looking windmills of the Salt-works, on the water side. The narrow portion of the beach between, forming the street, about eighteen feet wide, the only one where one carriage could pass another, if there was more than one carriage in the town, looked much ‚Äúheavier‚Äù than any portion of the beach or the desert which we had walked on, it being above the reach of the highest tide, and the sand being kept loose by the occasional passage of a traveller. We learned that the four planks on which we were walking had been bought by the town‚Äôs share of the Surplus Revenue, the disposition of which was a bone of contention between the inhabitants, till they wisely resolved thus to put it under foot. Yet some, it was said, were so provoked because they did not receive their particular share in money, that they persisted in walking in the sand a long time after the sidewalk was built. This is the only instance which I happen to know in which the surplus revenue proved a blessing to any town. A surplus revenue of dollars from the treasury to stem the greater evil of a surplus revenue of sand from the ocean. They expected to make a hard road by the time these planks were worn out. Indeed, they have already done so since we were there, and have almost forgotten their sandy baptism
As we passed along we observed the inhabitants engaged in curing either fish or the coarse salt hay which they had brought home and spread on the beach before their doors, looking as yellow as if they had raked it out of the sea. The front-yard plots appeared like what indeed they were, portions of the beach fenced in, with Beach-grass growing in them, as if they were sometimes covered by the tide. You might still pick up shells and pebbles there. There w",en,LABEL_0,0.472484827041626,LABEL_1,0.5275152325630188

Hey there bud, how'd it go last night?
I saw you at the band stand looking pretty slammed
Did you see me feeding all my drinks to Cam?
Probably not I guess, you were quite the mess

And that girl who tagged along there with you
I never caught her name but she seemed fucked up too
From where I sat she looked to be having fun
Keeping up with you, just like I used to


Hey there bud, how'd it go last night?
I'm sorry to have ditched out but I was pretty high
Heard from Leslie that on his stumble home
Nat was puking up all that beer she'd drunk

Though we didn't talk much how'd your evening go
You barely spoke a word to me besides that slurred hello
But I happened to see without even tryin'
How she laughed with you, just like I used to
See Peach Pit LiveGet tickets as low as $54You might also like

Hey there bud, how'd it go last night?
I woke up to a pair of shoes I've not seen next to mine
Did you whisper as you crept in through the door
How you'd never done much like this before?

I was thinking back just the other day

I don't know what's wrong with me
Nothing I do can make them see
That although I'm weirdly self-aware
That I'm the person who really cares
But you and me, we talked for hours
Walked around and got you flowers
Free spirit and an artist too
I've been looking for a girl like you


Not sure if we could call it a date
But I love your stories and how we relate
Just when I thought it was going swell
Said you're not looking for romance, but, hell
If you were, you say it would be with me
Just not the time for you to start anything
I guess I'll take the consolation prize
But what the fuck was that look in your eyes?

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Where the heart is full, it seeks, for a thousand reasons, in a thousand ways, to impart itself. How sweet, indispensable, in such cases, is fellowship; soul mystically strengthening soul! The meditative Germans, some think, have been of opinion that Enthusiasm in the general means simply excessive Congregating‚ÄîSchwarmerey, or Swarming. At any rate, do we not see glimmering half-red embers, if laid together, get into the brightest white glow?
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†In such a France, gregarious Reunions will needs multiply, intensify; French Life will step out of doors, and, from domestic, become a public Club Life. Old Clubs, which already germinated, grow and flourish; new every where bud forth. It is the sure symptom of Social Unrest: in such way, most infallibly of all, does Social Unrest exhibit itself; find solacement, and also nutriment. In every French head there hangs now, whether for terror or for hope, some prophetic picture of a New France: prophecy which brings, nay which almost is, its own fulfilment; and in all ways, consciously and unconsciously, works towards that.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Observe, moreover, how the Aggregative Principle, let it be but deep enough, goes on aggregating, and this even in a geometrical progression: how when the whole world, in such a plastic time, is forming itself into Clubs, some One Club, the strongest or luckiest, shall, by friendly attracting, by victorious compelling, grow ever stronger, till it become immeasurably strong; and all the others, with their strength, be either lovingly absorbed into it, or hostilely abolished by it! This if the Club-spirit is universal; if the time is plastic. Plastic enough is the time, universal the Club-spirit: such an all absorbing, paramount One Club cannot be wanting.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†What a progress, since the first salient-point of the Breton Committee! It worked long in secret, not languidly; it has come with the National Assembly to Paris; calls itself Club; calls itself in imitation, as is thought, of those generous Price-Stanhope English, French Revolution Club; but soon, with more originality, Club of Friends of the Constitution. Moreover it has leased, for itself, at a fair rent, the Hall of the Jacobin's Convent, one of our 'superfluous edifices;' and does therefrom now, in these spring months, begin shining out on an admiring Paris. And so, by degrees, under the shorter popular title of Jacobins' Club, it shall become memorable to all times and lands. Glance into the interior: strongly yet modestly benched and seated; as many as Thirteen Hundred chosen Patriots; Assembly Members not a few. Barnave, the two Lameths are seen there; occasionally Mirabeau, perpetually Robespierre; also the ferret-visage of Fouquier-Tinville with other attorneys; Anacharsis of Prussian Scythia, and miscellaneous Patriots,‚Äîthough all is yet in the most perfectly clean-washed state; decent, nay dignified. President on platform, President's bell are not wanting; oratorical Tribune high-raised; nor strangers' galleries, wherein also sit women. Has any French Antiquarian Society preserved that written Lease of the Jacobins Convent Hall? Or was it, unluckier even than Magna Charta, clipt by sacrilegious Tailors? Universal History is not indifferent to it.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†These Friends of the Constitution have met mainly, as their name may foreshadow, to look after Elections when an Election comes, and procure fit men; but likewise to consult generally that the Commonweal take no damage; one as yet sees not how. For indeed let two or three gather together any where, if it be not in Church, where all are bound to the passive state; no mortal can say accurately, themselves as little as any, for what they are gathered. How often has the broached barrel proved not to be for joy and heart effusion, but for duel and head-breakage; and the promised feast become a Feast of the Lapithae! This Jacobins Club, which at first shone resplendent, and was thought to be a new celestial Sun for enlightening the Nations, had, as things all have, to work through its appointed phases: it burned unfortunately more and more lurid, more sulphurous, distracted;‚Äîand swam at last, through the astonished Heaven, like a Tartarean Portent, and lurid-burning Prison of Spirits in Pain.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Its style of eloquence? Rejoice, Reader, that thou knowest it not, that thou canst never perfectly know. The Jacobins published a Journal of Debates, where they that have the heart may examine: Impassioned, full-droning Patriotic-eloquence; implacable, unfertile‚Äîsave for Destruction, which was indeed its work: most wearisome, though most deadly. Be thankful that Oblivion covers so much; that all carrion is by and by buried in the green Earth's bosom, and even makes her grow the greener. The Jacobins are buried; but their work is not; it continues 'making the tour of the world,' as it can. It might be seen lately, for instance, with bared bosom and death-defiant eye, as far on as Greek Missolonghi; and, strange enough, old slumbering Hellas was resuscitated, into somnambulism which will become clear wakefulness, by a voice from the Rue St. Honore! All dies, as we often say; except the spirit of man, of what man does. Thus has not the very House of the Jacobins vanished; scarcely lingering in a few old men's memories? The St. Honore Market has brushed it away, and now where dull-droning eloquence, like a Trump of Doom, once shook the world, there is pacific chaffering for poultry and greens. The sacred National Assembly Hall itself has become common ground; President's platform permeable to wain and dustcart; for the Rue de Rivoli runs there. Verily, at Cockcrow (of this Cock or the other), all Apparitions do melt and dissolve in space.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†The Paris Jacobins became 'the Mother-Society, Societe-Mere;' and had as many as 'three hundred' shrill-tongued daughters in 'direct correspondence' with her. Of indirectly corresponding, what we may call grand-daughters and minute progeny, she counted 'forty-four thousand!'‚ÄîBut for the present we note only two things: the first of them a mere anecdote. One night, a couple of brother Jacobins are doorkeepers; for the members take this post of duty and honour in rotation, and admit none that have not tickets: one doorkeeper was the worthy Sieur Lais, a patriotic Opera-singer, stricken in years, whose windpipe is long since closed without result; the other, young, and named Louis Philippe, d'Orleans's firstborn, has in this latter time, after unheard-of destinies, become Citizen-King, and struggles to rule for a season. All-flesh is grass; higher reedgrass or creeping herb.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†The second thing we have to note is historical: that the Mother-Society, even in this its effulgent period, cannot content all Patriots. Already it must throw off, so to speak, two dissatisfied swarms; a swarm to the right, a swarm to the left. One party, which thinks the Jacobins lukewarm, constitutes itself into Club of the Cordeliers; a hotter Club: it is Danton's element: with whom goes Desmoulins. The other party, again, which thinks the Jacobins scalding-hot, flies off to the right, and becomes 'Club of 1789, Friends of the Monarchic Constitution.' They are afterwards named 'Feuillans Club;' their place of meeting being the Feuillans Convent. Lafayette is, or becomes, their chief-man; supported by the respectable Patriot everywhere, by the mass of Property and Intelligence,‚Äîwith the most flourishing prospects. They, in these June days of 1790, do, in the Palais Royal, dine solemnly with open windows; to the cheers of the people; with toasts, with inspiriting songs,‚Äîwith one song at least, among the feeblest ever sung. (Hist. Parl. vi. 334.) They shall, in due time be hooted forth, over the borders, into Cimmerian Night.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Another expressly Monarchic or Royalist Club, 'Club des Monarchiens,' though a Club of ample funds, and all sitting in damask sofas, cannot realise the smallest momentary cheer; realises only scoffs and groans;‚Äîtill, ere long, certain Patriots in disorderly sufficient number, proceed thither, for a night or for nights, and groan it out of pain. Vivacious alone shall the Mother-Society and her family be. The very Cordeliers may, as it were, return into her bosom, which will have grown warm enough.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Fatal-looking! Are not such Societies an incipient New Order of Society itself? The Aggregative Principle anew at work in a Society grown obsolete, cracked asunder, dissolving into rubbish and primary atoms?Embed",en,LABEL_0,0.5079359412193298,LABEL_1,0.49206408858299255

Today we explore the righteous anger of Hole‚Äôs 1994 album Live Through This.
Try to imagine a famous woman who screams for a living today. Not alternative, punk-magazine famous, but American monoculture famous, platinum-selling-album famous, so famous her drug mishaps make headlines in Mexican newspapers, so famous rumors and conspiracies about her celebrity marriage hound her for decades. This woman doesn‚Äôt let out sing-screams or tinny emo yelps, but raw, diaphragmatic bellows‚Äîor, as David Fricke put it in his Rolling Stone review of Hole‚Äôs 1994 album Live Through This, a ‚Äúcorrosive, lunatic wail.‚Äù
He was wrong on the second point: There‚Äôs no lunacy on Hole‚Äôs records. But there is anger, female anger, which, to a man‚Äôs ear, historically scans as madness. Lead singer Courtney Love often told reporters that she named her band after a line in Euripides‚Äô Medea. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a hole that pierces right through me,‚Äù it supposedly goes, though you won‚Äôt find it in any common translation of the ancient play. It‚Äôs apocryphal, or misremembered, or Love made it up to complicate the name‚Äôs obvious double entendre‚Äîeither way, it makes a great myth. A band foregrounding female rage takes its name from the angriest woman in the Western canon, a woman so angry at her husband‚Äôs betrayal she kills their children just so he will feel her pain in his bones.
Like all female revenge fantasies written by men, Medea carries a grain of neurosis about how women might retaliate for their subjugation. It is easier, still, for men to express these anxieties by way of violent fantasy than it is for women to communicate their anger at all. In a 1996 New York Magazine cover story on women alternative singers entitled ‚ÄúFeminism Rocks,‚Äù Kim France, the founding editor of Lucky who also worked as New York‚Äôs deputy editor, paraphrased feminist journalist and author Susan Faludi: ‚ÄúWhile our culture admires the angry young man, who is perceived as heroic and sexy, it can‚Äôt find anything but scorn for the angry young woman, who is seen as emasculating and bitter.‚Äù This was true for Love, who watched grunge break through to the mainstream only to find that the freedom and rebellion it promised was reserved for her male counterparts. In grunge, men could be scruffy and rude and defy gender norms‚Äîthey could be rawer than the men modeled in synth-pop music videos or hair metal concerts a few years prior. Women, for all the space afforded them in the subculture‚Äôs spotlight moment, might as well have been Lilith.
Hole‚Äôs second album, Live Through This, famously came out four days after Love‚Äôs husband Kurt Cobain was found dead at their home in Seattle. The sudden tragedy threatened to swallow the music, to say nothing of the genre and social movement in which it was encased. Here was a dead rock god, and here was the woman who survived him. Even the album‚Äôs title alluded to Love‚Äôs endurance through a ground-shaking trauma, though of course she had written the title about surviving her fame, surviving her fraught association with the most beloved man in rock, surviving her pregnancy with their child, surviving the tabloid rumors that would‚Äîand still do‚Äîswarm her as a result.
‚ÄùI sometimes feel that no one‚Äôs taken the time to write about certain things in rock, that there‚Äôs a certain female point of view that‚Äôs never been given space,‚Äù Love told Sidelines in 1991, the same year Hole released their first album Pretty on the Inside. While there were plenty of rock songs written by men about hounding and abusing women, there were few about being hounded and abused. The rock canon, like all the others, fiercely guarded its male subjectivity, and Love wanted to break through its ranks.
She did so with violent contradictions. Love projected a high femme presence, all red lipstick and messy blonde hair like a bedraggled Marilyn Monroe, while commandeering her post at the microphone with masculine bravado. She wore baby-doll dresses and screamed at the coarse bottom-edge of her range. She was the first to admit the look was a compromise, a Trojan horse for her rage. ‚ÄúWhen women get angry, they are regarded as shrill or hysterical...One way around that, for me, is bleaching my hair and looking good,‚Äù she told the New York Times in 1992. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs bad that I have to do that to get my anger accepted. But then I‚Äôm part of an evolutionary process. I‚Äôm not the fully evolved end.‚Äù
If Pretty on the Inside delivered fury on the backs of abject impressionism, then Live Through This crystallized the same impulse into pop songs you could holler along to. Its lyrics juxtaposed visceral imagery‚Äîmilk and piss and blood‚Äîwith catchy, vituperative sloganeering. Hole walked the same high wire Nirvana did on Nevermind and In Utero, between bone-deep rage and syrupy hooks, only Hole‚Äôs job was harder: The band had to sell that unstable boundary through a female lens.
They had to sell Love, too, who had already committed a host of cardinal sins in the public eye. She was a woman without a filter married to a pop idol, and she had carried his child without giving up her celebrity or her art, without retreating into the shadows to become an incubator. An infamous 1992 Vanity Fair profile probed the question of Love‚Äôs irreconcilable role of expectant mother and rock star. Such a simultaneity does not exist in the popular imagination. She was impossible, she could not be, and according to sources quoted in the story, she was using drugs while pregnant. The story prompted an investigation from the Department of Children and Family Services, and Love‚Äôs newborn daughter Frances Bean was temporarily taken from her parents.
‚ÄùI want my baby/Who took my baby?‚Äù Love howls on ‚ÄúI Think That I Would Die,‚Äù and this time it‚Äôs not a metaphor; listeners could map that anguish onto events they‚Äôd seen unfold in real time. No one could accuse Love of lying, which didn‚Äôt stop rumors from bubbling up that her husband had written all the songs on Live Through This. Love carved an impossible space for herself in pop culture and was pilloried for it, and when she sang about the fallout, Nirvana fans cast her as a puppet for her husband‚Äôs genius just because the songs were good. It‚Äôs not like he could have written them, either; when Cobain wrote about rape, he wrote sardonically, and from the point of view of the rapist. The irony in his songs was apparently lost on some of his listeners. In that Vanity Fair profile, Love relayed a chilling anecdote she had heard about a girl who had been raped in Reno, whose rapists had been singing Nirvana‚Äôs song ‚ÄúPolly‚Äù while assaulting her. ‚ÄúThese are the people who listen to him,‚Äù she said.
Love wrote about sexual violence with a snarl, too, but a heavier, more knowing one. ‚ÄúWas she asking for it?/Was she asking nice?‚Äù she poses on the seething ‚ÄúAsking for It.‚Äù ‚ÄúIf she was asking for it/Did she ask you twice?‚Äù The song, she‚Äôs said, was inspired by a stage dive that took a wrong turn. She leapt into the audience to crowd-surf during a show, and found the crowd ready to devour her. ‚ÄúSuddenly, it was like my dress was being torn off me, my underwear was being torn off me, people were putting their fingers inside of me and grabbing my breasts really hard, screaming things in my ears like ‚Äòpussy-whore-cunt,‚Äô‚Äù she said. Whatever covenant binds fan and artist, whatever gives the latter power over the former, didn‚Äôt apply to Hole‚Äînot in totality, at least; not to the extent that it would keep a singer who was also a woman from being molested by her audience in public.
Live Through This refers to autobiographical traumas, but it is not a confessional record. ‚ÄúThe whole clich√© of women being cathartic really pisses me off,‚Äù Love said in a 1994 SPIN cover story. ‚ÄúYou know, ‚ÄòOh, this is therapy for me. I‚Äôd die if I didn‚Äôt write this.‚Äô Eddie Vedder says shit like that. Fuck you.‚Äù Her lyrics don‚Äôt hit like spleen-venting. They‚Äôre analytical, no matter how viscerally she howls them, and their insight transcends their origins. Throughout the record, Love speaks to the atomization of the female form that takes place in the eye of the misogynist. To the ogler, a woman is never whole. She‚Äôs shards: lips, hair, tits, ass, whatever can be grabbed without consequence, whatever can be bought and sold. Love would know, having stripped for a living before the band broke big, having made a career of, among other things, being looked at. She sings of ‚Äúpieces of Jennifer‚Äôs body.‚Äù On ‚ÄúDoll Parts,‚Äù against halting guitar chords, she sings about how she‚Äôs ‚Äúdoll eyes, doll mouth, doll legs.‚Äù Her multiplicity is underscored by backing harmonies from Hole bassist Kristen Pfaff and guest vocalist Dana Kletter, who chime in with the indelible line: ‚ÄúI want to be the girl with the most cake.‚Äù
As much as it concerns trauma and misogyny, Live Through This, like all great rock records, quakes with desire. Love deciphers what it means to be an object of desire, but she also plays a woman who wants ravenously. Her wanting, at the time, was a terror; she inspired so much vitriol in part because she refused to be passive, refused to accommodate a man‚Äôs hunger without indulging her own. She would not be a vessel or a muse. Her husband did not cast her in the drama of his life. She wanted him and chased him down, and then she wanted their child, and she believed that her desire mattered, that it had substance. ‚ÄúI went through all the shit and pain and inconvenience of being pregnant for nine whole fucking months because I wanted some of his beautiful genes in there, in that child,‚Äù Love told Melody Maker, in a profile that called her ‚Äúa one-woman spite factory‚Äù in its tagline, in February of 1994. ‚ÄúI wanted his babies. I saw something I wanted, and I got it. What‚Äôs wrong with that?‚Äù
On ‚ÄúI Think That I Would Die,‚Äù Love calls after her baby in the melodically barren verse, and then the song inverts itself into the album‚Äôs greatest hook. Hole pull this trick often, switching gears between repulsion and attraction at a moment‚Äôs notice, bombarding the listener with noise and then sweetly luring them back in. There is violence and there is desire and the line between the two is never clear. The album‚Äôs pummeling opener ‚ÄúViolet‚Äù baits the ear with a jangling guitar tone cut from the same cloth as R.E.M., and then drummer Patty Schemel churns the song into a fury. ‚ÄúGo on, take everything/Take everything/I want you to,‚Äù howls Love, her bitterness oxidized into defiance.
In a second profile of Love, published in 1995, Vanity Fair conducted the first-ever interview with the singer‚Äôs mother, the therapist Linda Carroll. ‚ÄúHer fame is not about being beautiful and brilliant, which she is,‚Äù Carroll said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about speaking in the voice of the anguish of the world.‚Äù That the anguish of the world would have a female voice was an idea new to the music industry. It‚Äôs still new. Love makes a bid for universality on Live Through This in that it‚Äôs hard not to get swept up in her energy, but she also acknowledges that female pain is marked, that it is compartmentalized and dismissed because it is felt by women, not people. Though Hole screamed open a space for angry, pained women artists like Alanis Morissette to thrive in the mainstream, that space is still bounded by the dismissal of men who will not deign to empathize with them. I think of the letter Larry Nassar wrote when early this year he pled guilty to assaulting hundreds of women and girls, how it looped in a popular misquote from a 17th-century play: ‚ÄúHell hath no fury like a woman scorned.‚Äù
‚ÄùDoll Parts‚Äù ends with a chilling, enigmatic hex: ‚ÄúSomeday you will ache like I ache,‚Äù Love glowers, and maybe it‚Äôs a threat but it could also be an oracle. It could be the promise that no matter how much you hate her, no matter how much spite you send her way, the venom will find its way back to you. That those severed parts will one day congeal into a furious living whole.Embed",en,LABEL_0,0.5330507755279541,LABEL_1,0.4669492542743683

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: She actually have a trainer in the water with one of our whales, the whale that -- they're not suppose to be in the water with?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: OK. We'll get somebody enroute and ...
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Enter gate number 3, the Shamu stadium.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Gate 3.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (inaudible) are you sure about this?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We need SOA (ph) to respond for a death (inaudible) in the SeaWorld. There's a whale who ate one of the trainers.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: A whale ate one of the trainers?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That's correct.
JOHN HARGROVE, FORMER SEAWORLD TRAINER: My parents first brought me to a SeaWorld park when I was very young. From that point forward, I was hooked. It meant everything to me because, you know, I've never wanted anything more.
SAMANTHA BERG, FORMER SEAWORLD TRAINER: I remember, you know, being probably in first or second grade, watching National Geographic Specials or Mutual of Omaha's specials and seeing whales and seeing dolphins. And you know, as a little kid, just being really incredibly inspired by it. I never went to Sea World. I grew up in New York so I went to the Bronx Zoo.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I grew up on a lake with horses. We'd swim the horses.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I grew up around the ocean.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I came from the middle of the country in flat land Kansas.
MARK SIMMONS, FORMER SEAWORLD TRAINER: I'm from Virginia, travel down, did the theme park thing in Orlando when I was 17 and saw the night show at Shamu Stadium, very emotional, you know, popular music and I was just -- I was very driven to one who do that.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And I saw what the trainers did. And I said, ""That's what I want to do.""
DEAN GORNERSALL, FORMER SEAWORLD TRAINER: One of the trainers there and do, ""What are you doing out there, you should be a trainer?"" I know how to train animals and they are training in almost my life.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: How do you prepare yourself for an encounter with an 8,000 pound Orcinus orca?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I always thought you needed like a Master's Degree in marine biology to be a trainer.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It takes years of study and experience to meet the strict requirements necessary to interact in the water with Shamu.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Come to find out, it really is more about your personality and how good you can swim.
GORNERSALL: I went to try out, got the job by the way. I'm like, yeah, I'm so excited and I was so, so excited.
BERG: I really wanted to be there. I really wanted to do the job. I couldn't wait to get in the water with the animals. I really was proud of being a SeaWorld trainer. You know, I thought this was the most amazing job.
CAROL RAY, FORMER SEAWORLD TRAINER: I showed up there on my first day, not really knowing what to expect. I was told to put on wet suit and get in the water.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Hi mom.
RAY: I was scared. I hold my wits.
SIMMONS: First of all, I put my wet suit on backwards because I was raised on -- in a farm in Virginia.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hi dad.
SIMMONS: My first part in memory at that time was that dolphins are a lot bigger than they look when you get in the water next to him.
GORNERSALL: Well, I watch the sea lion under show and that is kind of Mike Morocco. He comes out during the show with the dress on as Dorky, the alter ego of Dorothy, getting dressed with a sea lion -- the coward sea lion, right. He's walking along with his little basket. I go, ""I will never ever do that, you know."" Two months later, ""Hi, I'm Dorky,"" walking out on stage with the sea lion.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I was overwhelmed and I was so excited. I mean, just seeing a killer whale is breathtaking.
JOHN JETT, FORMER SEAWORLD TRAINER: I was just in awe. It's shocking to see how large they are and how beautiful they are.
BERG: Being, you know, in the presence of the killer whale, it was just inspiring and amazing and I remember seeing them for the first time, it's not being able to believe how huge they were.
You're there because you want to train killer whales and that's your goal. I didn't know what's going to happen so I wasn't expecting it. And one day, they say ""OK Sam, you're ready to go.""
BERG: Rise Dotty (ph).
You're going to stand on the whale, you're going to dive off the whale. The whale's going to swim under you and pick you up again then you're going do a criminal (ph) rider on the floor.
They just told me to go do it and I did it. Wow, I just rode a killer whale.
Yey, girly.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: When you look into their eyes, you know somebody is home, somebody is looking back. You form a very personal relationship with your animal.
SIMMONS: There is something absolutely amazing about working with an animal. You are a team and you build a relationship together and you both understand the goal and you help each other.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I feel like this whale she's probably 18 years old. I've seen her half up. We've grown up together.
SIMMONS: That's the joy I got out of it is this is a relationship like I've never had.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I come back and have Sinatra (ph).
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Bro, I have to know, are you nervous?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm scared.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Nice hair Jeff.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Can you see anything?
(CROSSTALK)
JEFFREY VENTRE, FORMER SEAWORLD TRAINER: I knew Dawn when she was new. She's a great person to work with and she obviously blossomed into one of the SeaWorld's best trainers.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This is Dawn Brancheau. Dawn is the senior trainer here at Shamu Stadium.
VENTRE: I guess you could say I kind of knew Dawn the past life. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's a tough job, isn't it?
DAWN BRANCHEAU: Yes, we really do go to a lot of physical exertion, you can see in the show. You do a lot of deep water work, breath hold and very high energy behaviors with the animals. Obviously, they're given a lot of energy too but we're working together and have long fun as well.
BERG: She's beautiful. She's blonde. She's athletic. She is friendly. You know, everybody loves Dawn.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And I mean this is sincerely, I've been watching you performing yesterday. You're amazing.
BRANCHEAU: Thank you.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You really are.
BERG: She captured what it means to be a SeaWorld trainer. She had so much experience that it made me realize what happened to her really could have happen to anyone.
REVERE: This is Detective Revere at Orange County Sherriff's office. Today's date is February 24, 2010, the time is 4:15. In the room with me right now is Thomas George Tobin, is that correct?
THOMAS TOBIN, SEAWORLD PARAMEDIC: Correct.
REVERE: Did you see any blood in the water or anything like that?
TOBIN: Well, that's part of it -- she was scalped and there was no blood.
REVERE: OK.
TOBIN: So, pretty much we knew then that the heart wasn't beating.
REVERE: Once they were able to pull her away, how did he let go of the ...
TOBIN: He didn't.
REVERE: He never let go of the ...
TOBIN: The arm?
REVERE: ... the arm.
TOBIN: He swallowed it.
REVERE: He swallowed it? So the arm Is nowhere.
TOBIN: Right. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (inaudible) in behalf of the federal government. He is basically suggesting that swimming with orcas is inherit the dangers and that you can't completely predict the outcome when you enter the water or enter their environment.
DAVE DUFFUS, OSHA EXPERT WITNESS, WHALE RESEARCHER: I said cracks (ph) in the Osha case. Stay out of proximity with the animals and you won't get killed.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's -- It will have a ripple effect to the whole industry. This was national headline news.
MARTHA SUGALSKI: SeaWorld's whale performances may never be the same.
JIM PAYNE: But right now, the theme park is arguing in court to keep whale trainers in the water something OSHA says is extremely dangerous.
WHOOPI GOLDBERG: These are wild animals and they are unpredictable because we don't speak whale. We don't speak whale. We don't speak tiger. We don't speak monkey.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And temper has slurred between the two sides today when OSHA's attorney suggested that SeaWorld only made changes after trainer Dawn Brancheau's death outraged the public.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: OSHA doesn't want the trainers going back in the water without a physical barrier between them and the whales.
DAVID KIRBY, AUTHOR, ""DEATH IN SEAWORLD"": Being in close proximity to this top predators is too dangerous.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They won't then be getting in the water riding on the whales things like that.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: If you were on a bathtub for 25 years, don't you think you get a little irritated, aggravated, maybe a little psychotic?
DUFFUS: The situation of Dawn Brancheau, it didn't just happen. It's not a singular event. You have to go back over 20 years to understand this.
JOHN CROWE, DIVER: One of the real exciting thing to do until everybody want to do it.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What were they telling you you're going to do?
CROWE: Capture orcas.
HOWARD GARRETT, ORCA RESEARCHER: They've had air craft. They had spotters. They had speedboats. They had bombs they were throwing in the water. They were lighting their bombs with acetylene torches in their boats and throwing those as fast they could to herd the whales into coves. But the Orcas have been caught before and they knew what was going on and they knew their young ones would be taken from them.
So the adults without young went East into cul-de-sac. And the boats followed them thinking they were all going that way while the mothers with babies went north but they captured king side (ph) aircraft. And they have to come up rear eventually and when they did, the capture teams alerted the boats and said, ""Oh, no, they're going north -- the ones with babies.""
So the boats, the speedboats caught them there and hurtled them in. And then they had fishing boats with same nets that they would spread across so none could leave and they could just pick out the young ones.
CROWE: We're only after the little ones. And the little ones, you know, also big animals still but I was told because of shipping cost that's why they only take the little ones.
GARRETT: They had -- the young ones that they wanted in the corals -- so they dropped the same nets and all the others could have left but they stayed.
CROWE: Whether they're trying to get the young Orca in the decker and the whole fam-damn-ly is out here 25 yards away maybe in a big lawn and they're communicating back and forth. Well, you understand then what you're doing, you know. I loft it. I mean, I just in turn crying. I didn't stop working but I, you know, just couldn't handle it -- just like kidnapping a little kid away from his mother. Everybody is watching, what can you do? But the worst thing that I could think of, you know, I can't think of being worst than that. Now, it does really sounds bad.
But when the whole hunt was over, there were three dead whales in the net. And so, they had Peter (ph) and Brian (ph), and I cut the whales open fill them with rocks and put anchors on their tail and sink them. Well, you know, really, I didn't even think about it being illegal at that point. I thought it was the PR thing.
GARRETT: They were finally ejected from the state of Washington by a court order in 1976. It was SeaWorld by name that was told, ""Do not come back to Washington to capture whales."" Without missing a beat, they went from Washington to Iceland and began capturing there.
CROWE: I've been part of the revolution to change the presidents in Central and South America. And seen some things that are hard to believe, but this is the worst thing that I've ever done, is hunt that whale.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Sealand is part of Victoria for over 20 years. They specialized in the care and display of killer whales.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: : By the time I started and he was four. He was up to 16 feet long and weight 4,000 pounds.
KAN BATCOMB, DIRECTOR: I haven't actually seen Tilikum quite a number of times. He was right across the street here in Victoria.
All Sealand was a net hanging in a marina with a float around it. .
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: : Tilikum was the one we really love to work with. He is very well-behaved and it was always eager to please.
STEVE HUXTER, FORMER DIRECTOR: When he is first introduced Tilikum just went fine and dandy (ph), but the previous head trainer used techniques that involved punishment with team, a trained Orca up with Tilikum who was untrained.
He would send them both off to do the same behavior. If Tilikum didn't do it, then both animals were punished.
Deprive of food to keep them hungry, this caused a lot of frustration with the larger animal that in establish animal and would in turn get frustrated with Tilikum and with rake him with his teeth.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There would be times during certain seasons that Tilikum would be covered head to toe with rakes. Rakes are teeth on teeth and raking the skin and from head to toe you could see blood and you could see scratches and he would just be raked up.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Both females would gang up on him. Tilikum was the one we trusted. We never were concerned about Tilikum.
The issue was really that we store these whales at night in what we call a modular which was 20 feet across and probably 30 feet deep, as a safety precaution because were worried about people cutting the net and letting them go, and the lights were all turned out.
So, literally no stimulation they're just in this dark metal 20 foot by 30 foot pool for two thirds of their life.
HUXTER: When we first started they were quite small and quite young. So they fit in their quite nicely, but they're immobile for the most part.
It didn't feel good. It just didn't and it was just wrong.
CHRISTOPHER PORTER: We started having difficult in getting them all into this one small steel box to be honest that's what it was. It was a floating steel box.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That's where food deprivation would come in. We would hold back food and they would know if they were in the module that they would get their food. So they're hungry now, they're going go in there.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And during the winter that would be from 5 at night till 7 in the morning.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: When you let them out, you see these new two streaks and sometimes you see blood.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Closing that door on him and knowing that he's locked in there for the whole night is like, (inaudible) into.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well, if that is true, that's not only, you know, inhumane and I'll tell him so but it probably led to what I think is a psychosis that he was on here (inaudible) kill.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: An employee is dead after an encounter.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Here at the Canadian park called Sealand of the Pacific.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The victim Keltie Byrne was a championship swimmer and a part-time worker at Sealand.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: AS seen at this home video, rescuers used the huge net to try -- the workers' efforts were hindered by the agitated whale.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'd like to make the (inaudible) Pacific team this summer but my more media goes just to swim fast and (inaudible)
NADINE KATLEN: It was sort of cloudy grey day and we were looking for something to do, so we -- why not go to Sealand, it was kind of like this dingy pool with these whales and ...
CORINNE COWELL: It just felt a little bit of like an amusement park that was kind of one of glass place (ph) and everything was a bit grey.
KATLEN: Yeah. It was like a swimming pool.
COWELL: Yeah, yup.
KATLEN: You know, dirty whales in a swimming pool.
COWELL: No, and they would come up and touch the ball and there was, I think there was some tail splashing and there was some ...
KATLEN: Some jumping ...
COWELL: Of the fish and ...
KATLEN: And they hold the fish and the whales jump up. I remember saying, ""Oh, what a fun job,"" you know, she's still lucky, and then I saw her walking with her rubber boots and she tripped and her foot just dipped into the edge of the pool and she lost her balance and fell in and then she was pushing her way up to get out of the pool and the whales zoomed over, grab her boot and pulled her back in. At first I didn't think it was that serious because you see the trainer in the pool with the whale and you think, ""Oh, well, you know, the whales are used to that,"" and you know, and then all of a sudden, they had started getting -- there is more swimming, more activity, more trashing, and then she was starting to get panicked and then as it progressed, you started to realize, well, some thing is not right here.
COWELL: She started to scream and she started looking around and her eyes were like bigger and bigger and realizing that I really am in trouble here.
KATLEN: And then they would pull her under and then they would come up and then when she -- they came up she'd be, ""Help me, help me,"" and then they take her down again.
COWELL: And she would be submerged for several seconds up to -- I don't know maybe a minute, you don't -- you're not keep in tracked.
KATLEN: So, you know, it was harder and harder for her to, you know, get that air in because she was screaming and my sister remembers her saying, ""I don't want to die.""
Well, condolences to Keltie's family.
COWELL: Yeah. That we couldn't help her. It's pretty wretched.
DUFFUS: The Sealand close well, it's probably a good thing, I mean, it was a little pond and I think the owner, you know, made the right decision for whatever reasons. I don't believe he's a bad guy, a bad man, and then he was shocked by the whole affair too.
HUXTER: The blush was gone from the business and he decided that was it, we should shut (ph) down.
KATLEN: And no one ever contacted us, there was an inquest, no one ever asked us to say what happened, you know, we just left.
DUFFUS: You know, there was no big lawsuits afterwards and there's no memorial and, you know, the only thing remain in of Keltie Byrne is, you know, what's left in the folk's minds who recall the case.
KATLEN: So in the newspaper articles, the cause of death was that she drowned accidentally, but you know, she was pulled under by the whale.
DUFFUS: Well, there's a bit of smoking mirrors (ph) going on, I mean one of the fundamental facts is that none of the witnesses were clear about which whale pulled Keltie in.
KATLEN: Yes, yeah, it was the large whale Tilikum, the male is the one that went after her, and the other two just kind of circled around but he was definitely the instigator and we knew it was that whale because he had the flapped over fin like it was very easy to tell. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Sealand of Pacific closed its doors and was looking I guess to make a bulk on the way out and these whales are worth millions of dollars.
BERG: When SeaWorld heard that Tilikum was available after this accident at Sealand of the Pacific they really wanted Tilikum because they needed a breather. So, I don't even think that anybody even was questioning like, is this a good idea?
HUXTER: My understanding of the situation was that Tilikum and the others would not be used in a show, they would not performance animals, our understanding of their behavior was that it was such a highly stimulating event for them that they were likely to repeat it.
PORTER: The Sealand was -- we were all young and a bit of sea cowboys and a bit -- we weren't so technical only scientific at the SeaWorld. So, we all have this vision that they knew more than us and they were better than us and Tilikum would have a bigger pool, and he would have a better life, then he would have a better care, and he would have better food, and be a great life for him.
So, it was like, ""OK Tili you're going to Disneyland. Lucky you.""
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The Orca's intelligence maybe even superior to man's. As parents they are exemplary other than many human beings, unlike human beings they have a profound instinct for vengeance. Dino De Laurentiis presents, ""Orca"".
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GARRETT: If you go back only 35 years, we knew nothing in fact less than nothing. What the public had was superstition and fear.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Between the two most dangerous animals on earth.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What in hell are you?
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GARRETT: These were the vicious killer whales that, you know, have 48 sharp teeth that would rip to shreds if they got a change.
What we learn is that they are amazingly friendly and understanding and intuitively want to be your companion.
And to this day there is no record of an Orca doing any harm to any human in the wild. They lived in these big families. And they have life spans very similar to human life spans. The females can live to about a hundred maybe more. Males to about 50 or 60, but the adult offspring never leave their mother's side.
Each community has a completely different set of behaviors. Each has a complete repertoire of vocalizations with no overlap. And you can call them languages the scientific community is reluctant to say any another animal but humans uses languages, but there's every indication that they use languages.
LORI MARINO, NEUROSCIENTIST: The Orca brain just screens out intelligence awareness. We took this tremendous brain and we put in a Magnetic Resonance Imaging scanner, what we found is just astounding. They've got a part in the brain that humans don't have. A part of their brain has extended out right adjacent to their limbic system. The system processes emotions.
The safest inference would be these are animals that have highly elaborated emotional lives. It's becoming clear that dolphins and whales have a sense itself, a sense of social bonding that they've taken to another level much stronger, much more complex than another mammals including humans.
We looked at mass trendings (ph) the fact that they stand by each other. Everything about them is social, everything. It's been suggested that their whole sense of self is distributed among the individuals in their group.
(BEGIM VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Five of them. This Orca are going to attack this sea lion, cave in, breaking the ice off and swimming around. Oh, here they come. Two of them Look it underneath them. You can se them underneath. They made a big wave. Look at that, big wave.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Oh, God, no. No. Oh, I can't stand it.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If you can't watch the bull fight. You better leave. Here they go. Look at this, three of them.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: God. Oh, no. Oh, God.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's all over.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No. Not quite.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yeah, it's all over. It's all over.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DUFFUS: The first nation's vehicle and, you know, fishermen from the a coast, they call him blackfish. There are an animal that possesses great spiritual power and not to be meddled with.
I spent a lot of time around killer whales. They're always in charge (ph). I never get out of the boat. I never mess with them. The speed and the power is quite amazing. Rules are the same as (inaudible) one foot on the floor at all times.
Even after seeing them thousands of times. You see them and you still, you know, wake up.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
VENTRE: He arrived I think in 1992. I was at well in the (ph) on dolphin stadium when he arrived and he's twice as large as the next animal in the facility.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This guy is right in about 12,000 pounds. That's incredible. He looks fantastic.
JETT: When until it came arrived at SeaWorld, he was attacked viciously, repeatedly by Catina (ph) and others. In the wild, it's a very matriarchal society, male whales are kept at the perimeter. In captivity, animals are squeezed into very close proximity.
Tilikum, the poor guy is so large. He couldn't get away because he just as not as immobile relative to the smaller and more agile females. And where is he going to run, there's no place to run.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think he spent a lot of time in isolation. And SeaWorld it claims, ""No, no, he's always in with the other -- with the females,"" but I mean, you know, from what I thought he was mostly put with the females for breeding purposes. And he didn't spend a lot of time, you know, with the other whales.
JETT: It's for his own protection, you know, he gets beat up and so by segregating him it provides a physical barrier so that females can't kick his butt.
VENTRE: Tilikum is pretty much kept in the back and then brought out at the very end like the big splash.
He was always happy to see in the morning. Maybe because he was alone, maybe because he was hungry and maybe because he just like you, who knows what was going on in his head.
BERG: He seemed to like to work, he seemed to be interested, he seemed to want to learn new things. He seemed to be enjoying, you know, working with the trainers.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He for me it was a, a joy. He really responded to me and I, you know, everyday I wen to work, I was happy to see Tili.
BERG: I never got the impression of him while I was there that, you know, ""Oh, my God."" You know, he's the scary whale, you know, not at all.
VENTRE: Maybe some of us just are naivete or whatever, you know, because we weren't given the full details of the Keltie situation.
BERG: I was under the impression that Tilikum had nothing to do with her death specifically that it was the female whales responsible for her death. What I found really odd at first was the way they are acting around this whale and what they had told us seemed to me to be two different things.
On the first day he arrived, I remember one of the seniors trainers at, SeaWorld, she -- Tilikum was in a pool and she was blocking over a gate and she had her wet suit unzipped and was tied around her waist. And she was making cooing (ph) noises and going, ""Hey, Tilikum, you cute little whale."" You know, she was like just, you know, come play talking at him and one of the supervisor said, ""Get her out of there."" And just screamed at her, you know, like ""Get her, get her away from there."" Like they were so worried that something was going to happen. And I remember thinking why you guys making such a big deal out of this when he didn't actually kill her.
Well, clearly management thought there was, there was some reason to exercise caution around him. You know, it's clearly they knew more than they were telling us.
Jeff was out in the audience filming one of the Shamu shows. It was a perfect show all of the hotdog sequences, the water works sequences went off great.
VENTRE: I was really excited just to be capturing this because it was kind of turning out to be a great show.
A show that's kind of complete. It doesn't -- it probably when it happens a few times a week.
BERG: At the very end of the show, Liz (ph) was working Tilikum and apparently Tilikum lunged out of the water at her.
VENTRE: And I had captured Tilikum coming out of the water kind of turning sideways and appeared to be to try to grab Liz (ph). And at that moment that the tape became unusable, I was just kind of basically instructed to get rid of the tape.
Wanting to kind of preserve the tape I actually used the editing equipment and like snipped out that little half second or a second when he did that and stitched it back together. So, it's just kind of look like a glitch in the tape and I'm like, ""Look at this."" And it was like no. This is no longer usable, you know. And so we had to destroy the tape.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
VENTRE: It's pretty outrageous that SeaWorld would claim there was no expecting Tilikum would come out of the water because they had witnessed him coming out of the water and it's written into his profile. He lunges at trainers.
RAY: I spewed out the party line during shows. I'm totally mortified now there is like something like look at Namu (ph), you know, and Namu (ph) is not doing that because she has to.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
RAY: Namu (ph) is doing that because she really wants to.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
RAY: Oh my gosh. Like some of the things I'm embarrassed by, so embarrassed by.
At the time I think I could have convinced myself that the relationships that we have were built on something stronger than the fact that I'm giving them fish, you know, I like to think that but I don't know if that's the truth.
I had been there awhile and I'd seen a few other things along the way that made me question why I was there and what we were doing with these animals.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: November 4th, 1988, a killer whale at SeaWorld gave a performance of a lifetime. Don't miss this small miracle. Come see our new baby Shamu.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
RAY: I know it was naive of me, but I thought that it was our responsibility to do as much as we could to keep their family units together since we knew that in the wild that's what happens.
Kalina (ph) was the first baby Shamu. She had become quite disruptive and challenging her mom a little bit, and disrupting from shows and that kind of thing.
It was decided by the higher ups that she would be moved to another park when she was just four and a half years old and that was new to us as trainers that we're working with her. To me it had never crossed my mind that they might be moving the baby from her mom.
The supervisors basically kind of mocking me like, ""Oh, you're saying poor Kalina (ph)?"" You know, ""What she going to do without her mommy?"" And, you know, and that of course to shut me off.
So the night of the move, we had to deploy the net and separate them and got Kalina (ph) the baby into the net pool and Catina (ph) was generally a quiet whale. She was not overly vocal whale.
After Kalina (ph) was removed from the scene and put on the truck and taken to the airport and Catina (ph), her mom, was left on pool. She stayed in the corner of the pool like literally just shaking and screaming -- screeching crying like I'd never seen her do anything like that.
And the other females in the pool maybe once or twice during the night they come out and check on her. And she just screech and cry and they would just run back. There is nothing that you could call that watching it besides grief.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Those are not your whales. You know, you love them and you think I'm the one that touches them, tease them, keeps them alive, gives them the care that they need. They're not your whales. They own them. Kusaka (ph) and Takara we're very close. Kusaka (ph) was the mother, Takara is a calf. Takara was special to me.
They were inseparable. When they separated to Kusaka (ph) and Takara it was to take Takara to Florida. Once Takara had already been stretchered out of the pool, put on the truck, driven to the airport, Kusaka (ph) continued to make the vocals that had never been heard before.
They brought in the senior research scientist to analyze the vocals. They were long range vocals. She was trying something that no one had even heard before looking for Takara. That's heartbreaking.
How can anyone look at that and think that that is morally acceptable. It's not. It is not OK.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Good afternoon Richard. The new show is whale and off (inaudible) -- what it does is it shows the relationship we have between all our animals here at the whale ...
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GORNERSALL: There's so many things that were told to us, that they tell us -- they tell you so many times that you just start believing it, you know.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So, all the animals here get along very well. It's just like turning your dog really.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I was blind, you know. I was a kid and I didn't notice I was down really.

BERG: Ladies and gentlemen this is David from Maryland. Go ahead and wave at everyone, David.

BERG: It just really bought into what they told us. You know, I learned to say what they told us to the audience.

BERG: Hello out here. Children are some of Shamu's biggest fan.
We can do just about anything we want.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BERG: I thought I'd do everything about killer whales when I work there. You know and everything about these animals and really know nothing about killer whales. I know a lot about being an animal trainer or killer whale trainer, but I don't know anything about these animals, their natural history, or their behavior.
I really in some ways believed a lot of way I was learning from them, because why would",en,LABEL_0,0.5181573629379272,LABEL_1,0.48184260725975037

Don't you know that you're the only queen
Of this one-horse town?
You're the only one that meant a thing to me
You're still hanging around
You're still hanging around

I used to see you on the side walk
Standing in your high tops
Ruining your pretty lungs
With your cigarette smoke
It ain't keeping you young
Touch me like you know me
Baby when you're lonely
Kiss me on my open mouth
I'll throw you a rope
I'll keep pulling you out

Out in the heartland
I looked in your eyes
And I asked, ""Are you ready
Ready for this life?""

Did you see it coming?
It happened so fast
The timing was perfect
Water on glass

Like tracing figure eights
On ice in skates, oh well
And if this ice should break
It would be my mistake

Between the cities
Between the thrills
There's something inside you
That doesn't sleep well

It won't last forever
Or maybe it will
The white clothes they gave you
You wear them so well
You might also like
Someone once told me
In love, that you must
Place all you're given
In infinite trust

Yet I'm tracing figure eights
On ice in skates, so well
And if this ice should break

I‚Äôve been leaving your shampoo bottles
Over in the corner there
Sitting empty on the bathtub rail
Wishing‚ÄÖthey‚ÄÖcould wash your‚ÄÖhair
Yeah, I keep em by that‚ÄÖcrumb of fancy soap
And your toothbrush at my bathroom sink
Your cell phone chargers still hanging from the wall
Haven‚Äôt chucked it all, like you'd think
Though you haven‚Äôt been around in weeks

I‚Äôve run out of my Speed Stick, honey
So I have been using yours
It's frickin trash, all that organic hoo hah
From one of your health food stores
It is seemingly worsened everyday
All this shit of yours around my house
If I could‚Äôve had it any other way
Then by now I would‚Äôve chucked it out
But it seems to wanna stick around

I‚Äôve been leaving you in radio silence
Though I‚Äôd love to catch a pass
Waited long enough that I could never call you
Baby, how fucked is that?
And it‚Äôs all just so forgettable
Til I‚Äôm sitting with your stuff alone
Man, why can‚Äôt I just let it go?
See Peach Pit LiveGet tickets as low as $54You might also like
I‚Äôve been seeing that red Corolla parked out on the corner there
If it were yours, there‚Äôd be some hippie bullshit hanging from the rearview mirror
As I‚Äôm passing it every other day
I look in to see if this one‚Äôs yours
But the shape it‚Äôs in is giving it away
Yours is dented up and down the doors
Never wanted to see it more

I‚Äôve been leaving you in radio silence
Though I‚Äôd love to catch a pass
Waited long enough that I could never call you
Baby, how fucked is that?
And it‚Äôs all just so forgettable

Speaking virtually and constantly waiting
Is there something you're really saying?
Will I ever get to know?
Dreaming, waitin' 'til the dawn to respond next
Look away, but I can't help to check if your character rate grows

Trying, acting like we don't already know
That new pocket music box can show we've already fired the gun
Listening to ""I'm a Pretender"" on repeat
Wonder if you knew that it'd all seem to take the words right off my tongue

My life's going by, but it's just begun


Sharing all the things we lov–µd when we grew up
M–µmorizing things that you knew of
You can make all mine your own
Making plans for both of us to go on a
Guitar Romantic Search Adventure, will we ever get to go?

You might also like
I hope we can sometime
Wish we could cancel time
Or let it all fly by
Just tell me that it's over now
I'm way too in my head
I try not to punch it red
Could you hold it instead and tell me that it's over now?
I look forward to
A little me and you
So now I hope that you don't tell me that it's over7Embed",en,LABEL_0,0.4579167068004608,LABEL_1,0.5420833230018616

Doin' burnouts through the country like my wheels spinnin' on cruise control

THE SORROWS OF M. DE CHARLUS. ‚Äî HIS SHAM DUEL. ‚Äî THE STATIONS ON THE ‚ÄòTRANSATLANTIC.‚Äô‚Äî WEARY OF ALBERTINE I DECIDE TO BREAK WITH HER
I was dropping with sleep. I was taken up to my floor not by the liftboy, but by the squinting page, who to make conversation informed me that his sister was still with the gentleman who was so rich, and that, on one occasion, when she had made up her mind to return home instead of sticking to her business, her gentleman friend had paid a visit to the mother of the squinting page and of the other more fortunate children, who had very soon made the silly creature return to her protector. ‚ÄúYou know, Sir, she‚Äôs a fine lady, my sister is. She plays the piano, she talks Spanish. And you would never take her for the sister of the humble employee who brings you up in the lift, she denies herself nothing; Madame has a maid to herself, I shouldn‚Äôt be surprised if one day she keeps her carriage. She is very pretty, if you could see her, a little too high and mighty, but, good lord, you can understand that. She‚Äôs full of fun. She never leaves a hotel without doing something first in a wardrobe or a drawer, just to leave a little keepsake with the chambermaid who will have to wipe it up. Sometimes she does it in a cab, and after she‚Äôs paid her fare, she‚Äôll hide behind a tree, and she doesn‚Äôt half laugh when the cabby finds he‚Äôs got to clean his cab after her. My father had another stroke of luck when he found my young brother that Indian Prince he used to know long ago. It‚Äôs not the same style of thing, of course. But it‚Äôs a superb position. The travelling by itself would be a dream. I‚Äôm the only one still on the shelf. But you never know. We‚Äôre a lucky family; perhaps one day I shall be President of the Republic. But I‚Äôm keeping you talking‚Äù (I had not uttered a single word and was beginning to fall asleep as I listened to the flow of his). ‚ÄúGood-night, Sir. Oh! Thank you, Sir. If everybody had as kind a heart as you, there wouldn‚Äôt be any poor people left. But, as my sister says, ‚Äòthere will always have to be the poor so that now I‚Äôm rich I can s ‚Äî t on them.‚Äô You‚Äôll pardon the expression. Goodnight, Sir.‚Äù
¬†¬†¬†Perhaps every night we accept the risk of facing, while we are asleep, sufferings which we regard as unreal and unimportant because they will be felt in the course of a sleep which we suppose to be unconscious. And indeed on these evenings when I came back late from la Raspeli√®re I was very sleepy. But after the weather turned cold I could not get to sleep at once, for the fire lighted up the room as though there were a lamp burning in it. Only it was nothing more than a blazing log, and ‚Äî like a lamp too, for that matter, like the day when night gathers ‚Äî its too bright light was not long in fading; and I entered a state of slumber which is like a second room that we take, into which, leaving our own room, we go when we want to sleep. It has noises of its own and we are sometimes violently awakened by the sound of a bell, perfectly heard by our ears, although nobody has rung. It has its servants, its special visitors who call to take us out so that we are ready to get up when we are compelled to realise, by our almost immediate transmigration into the other room, the room of overnight, that it is empty, that nobody has called
¬†¬†¬†The race that inhabits it is, like that of our first human ancestors, androgynous. A man in it appears a moment later in the form of a woman. Things in it shew a tendency to turn into men, men into friends and enemies. The time that elapses for the sleeper, during these spells of slumber, is absolutely different from the time in which the life of the waking man is passed. Sometimes its course is far more rapid, a quarter of an hour seems a day, at other times far longer, we think we have taken only a short nap, when we have slept through the day. Then, in the chariot of sleep, we descend into depths in which memory can no longer overtake it, and on the brink of which the mind has been obliged to retrace its steps. The horses of sleep, like those of the sun, move at so steady a pace, in an atmosphere in which there is no longer any resistance, that it requires some little aerolith extraneous to ourselves (hurled from the azure by some Unknown) to strike our regular sleep (which otherwise Would have no reason to stop, and would continue with a similar motion world without end) and to make it swing sharply round, return towards reality, travel without pause, traverse the regions bordering on life in which presently the sleeper will hear the sounds that come from life, quite vague still, but already perceptible, albeit corrupted ‚Äî and come to earth suddenly and awake. Then from those profound slumbers we awake in a dawn, not knowing who we are, being nobody, newly born, ready for anything, our brain being emptied of that past which was previously our life. And perhaps it is more pleasant still when our landing at the waking-point is abrupt and the thoughts of our sleep, hidden by a cloak of oblivion, have not time to return to us in order, before sleep ceases. Then, from the black tempest through which we seem to have passed (but we do not even saywe), we emerge prostrate, without a thought, a we that is void of content. What hammer-blow has the person or thing that is lying there received to make it unconscious of anything, stupefied until the moment when memory, flooding back, restores to it consciousness or personality? Moreover, for both these kinds of awakening, we must avoid falling asleep, even into deep slumber, under the law of habit. For everything that habit ensnares in her nets, she watches closely, we must escape her, take our sleep at a moment when we thought we were doing anything else than sleeping, take, in a word, a sleep that does not dwell under the tutelage of foresight, in the company, albeit latent, of reflexion. At least, in these awakenings which I have just described, and which I experienced as a rule when I had been dining overnight at la Raspeli√®re, everything occurred as though by this process, and I can testify to it, I the strange human being who, while he waits for death to release him, lives behind closed shutters, knows nothing of the world, sits motionless as an owl, and like that bird begins to see things a little plainly only when darkness falls. Everything occurs as though by this process, but perhaps only a layer of wadding has prevented the sleeper from taking in the internal dialogue of memories and the incessant verbiage of sleep. For (and this may be equally manifest in the other system, vaster, more mysterious, more astral) at the moment of his entering the waking state, the sleeper hears a voice inside him saying: ‚ÄúWill you come to this dinner to-night, my dear friend, it would be such fun?‚Äù and thinks: ‚ÄúYes, what fun it will be, I shall go‚Äù; then, growing wider awake, he suddenly remembers: ‚ÄúMy grandmother has only a few weeks to live, the Doctor assures us.‚Äù He rings, he weeps at the thought that it will not be, as in the past, his grandmother, his dying grandmother, but an indifferent waiter that will come in answer to his summons. Moreover, when sleep bore him so far away from the world inhabited by memory and thought, through an ether in which he was alone, more than alone; not having that companion in whom we perceive things, ourself, he was outside the range of time and its measures. But now the footman is in the room, and he dares not ask him the time, for he does not know whether he has slept, for how many hours he has slept (he asks himself whether it should not be how many days, returning thus with weary body and mind refreshed, his heart sick for home, as from a journey too distant not to have taken a long time). We may of course insist that there is but one time, for the futile reason that it is by looking at the clock that we have discovered to have been merely a quarter of an hour what we had supposed a day. But at the moment when we make this discovery we are a man awake, plunged in the time of waking men, we have deserted the other time. Perhaps indeed more than another time: another life. The pleasures that we enjoy in sleep, we do not include them in the list of the pleasures that we have felt in the course of our existence. To allude only to the most grossly sensual of them all, which of us, on waking, has not felt a certain irritation at having experienced in his sleep a pleasure which, if he is anxious not to tire himself, he is not, once he is awake, at liberty to repeat indefinitely during the day. It seems a positive waste. We have had pleasure, in another life, which is not ours. Sufferings and pleasures of the dream-world (which generally vanish soon enough after our waking), if we make them figure in a budget, it is not in the current account of our life
¬†¬†¬†Two times, I have said; perhaps there is only one after all, not that the time of the waking man has any validity for the sleeper, but perhaps because the other life, the life in which he sleeps, is not ‚Äî in its profounder part ‚Äî included in the category of time. I came to this conclusion when on the mornings after dinners at la Raspeli√®re I used to lie so completely asleep. For this reason. I was beginning to despair, on waking, when I found that, after I had rung the bell ten times, the waiter did not appear. At the eleventh ring he came. It was only the first after all. The other ten had been mere suggestions in my sleep which still hung about me, of the peal that I had been meaning to sound. My numbed hands had never even moved. Well, on those mornings (and this is what makes me say that sleep is perhaps unconscious of the law of time) my effort to awaken consisted chiefly in an effort to make the obscure, undefined mass of the sleep in which I had just been living enter into the scale of time. It is no easy task; sleep, which does not know whether we have slept for two hours or two days, cannot provide any indication. And if we do not find one outside, not being able to re-enter time, we fall asleep again, for five minutes which seem to us three hours
¬†¬†¬†I have always said ‚Äî and have proved by experiment ‚Äî that the most powerful soporific is sleep itself. After having slept profoundly for two hours, having fought against so many giants, and formed so many lifelong friendships, it is far more difficult to awake than after taking several grammes of veronal. And so, reasoning from one thing to the other, I was surprised to hear from the Norwegian philosopher, who had it from M. Boutroux, ‚Äúmy eminent colleague ‚Äî pardon me, my brother,‚Äù what M. Bergson thought of the peculiar effects upon the memory of soporific drugs. ‚ÄúNaturally,‚Äù M. Bergson had said to M. Boutroux, if one was to believe the Norwegian philosopher, ‚Äúsoporifics, taken from time to time in moderate doses, have no effect upon that solid memory of our everyday life which is so firmly established within us. But there are other forms of memory, loftier, but also more unstable. One of my colleagues lectures upon ancient history. He tells me that if, overnight, he has taken a tablet to make him sleep, he has great difficulty, during his lecture, in recalling the Greek quotations that he requires. The doctor who recommended these tablets assured him that they had no effect upon the memory. ‚ÄòThat is perhaos because you do not have to quote Greek,‚Äô the historian answered, not without a note of derisive pride.‚Äù
¬†¬†¬†I cannot say whether this conversation between M. Bergson and M. Boutroux is accurately reported. The Norwegian philosopher, albeit so profound and so lucid, so passionately attentive, may have misunderstood. Personally, in my own experience I have found the opposite result. The moments of oblivion that come to us in the morning after we have taken certain narcotics have a resemblance that is only partial, though disturbing, to the oblivion that reigns during a night of natural and profound sleep. Now what I find myself forgetting in either case is not some line of Baudelaire, which on the other hand keeps sounding in my ear, it is not some concept of one of the philosophers above-named, it is the actual reality of the ordinary things that surround me ‚Äî if I am asleep ‚Äî my non-perception of which makes me an idiot; it is, if I am awakened and proceed to emerge from an artificial slumber, not the system of Porphyry or Plotinus, which I can discuss as fluently as at any other time, but the answer that I have promised to give to an invitation, the memory of which is replaced by a universal blank. The lofty thought remains in its place; what the soporific has put out of action is the power to act in little things, in everything that demands activity in order to-seize at the right moment, to grasp some memory of everyday life. In spite of all that may be said about survival after the destruction of the brain, I observe that each alteration of the brain is a partial death. We possess all our memories, but not the faculty of recalling them, said, echoing M. Bergson, the eminent Norwegian philosopher whose language I have made no attempt to imitate in order not to prolong my story unduly. But not the faculty of recalling them. But what, then, is a memory which we do not recall? Or, indeed, let us go farther. We do not recall our memories of the last thirty years; but we are wholly steeped in them; why then stop short at thirty years, why not prolong back to before out birth this anterior life? The moment that I do not know a whole section of the memories that are behind me, the moment that they are invisible to me, that I have not the faculty of calling them to me, who can assure me that in that mass unknown to me there are not some that extend back much farther than my human life. If I can have in me and round me so many memories which I do not remember, this oblivion (a de facto oblivion, at least, since I have not the faculty of seeing anything) may extend over a life which I have lived in the body of another man, even upon another planet. A common oblivion effaces all. But what, in that case, signifies that immortality of the soul the reality of which the Norwegian philosopher affirmed? The person that I shall be after death has no more reason to remember the man whom I have been since my birth than the latter to remember what I was before it
¬†¬†¬†The waiter came in. I did not mention to him that I had rung several times, for I was beginning to realise that hitherto I had only dreamed that I was ringing. I was alarmed nevertheless by the thought that this dream had had the clear precision of experience. Experience would, reciprocally, have the irreality of a dream
¬†¬†¬†Instead I asked him who it was that had been ringing so often during the night. He told me: ‚ÄúNobody,‚Äù and could prove his statement, for the bell-board would have registered any ring. And yet I could hear the repeated, almost furious peals which were still echoing in my ears and were to remain perceptible for several days. It is however seldom that sleep thus projects into our waking life memories that do not perish with it. We can count these aeroliths. If it is an idea that sleep has forged, it soon breaks up into slender, irrecoverable fragments. But, in this instance, sleep had fashioned sounds. More material and simpler, they lasted longer. I was astonished by the relative earliness of the hour, as told me by the waiter. I was none the less refreshed. It is the light sleeps that have a long duration, because, being an intermediate state between waking and sleeping, preserving a somewhat faded but permanent impression of the former, they require infinitely more time to refresh us than a profound sleep, which may be short. I felt quite comfortable for another reason. If remembering that we are tired is enough to make us feel our tiredness, saying to oneself: ‚ÄúI am refreshed,‚Äù is enough to create refreshment. Now I had been dreaming that M. de Charlus was a hundred and ten years old, and had just boxed the ears of his own mother, Madame Verdurin, because she had paid five thousand millions for a bunch of violets; I was therefore assured that I had slept profoundly, had dreamed the reverse of what had been in my thoughts overnight and of all the possibilities of life at the moment; this was enough to make me feel entirely refreshed
¬†¬†¬†I should greatly have astonished my mother, who could not understand M. de Charlus‚Äôs assiduity in visiting the Verdurins, had I told her whom (on the very day on which Albertine‚Äôs toque had been ordered, without a word about it to her, in order that it might come as a surprise) M. de Charlus had brought to dine in a private room at the Grand Hotel, Balbec. His guest was none other than the footman of a lady who was a cousin of the Cambremers. This footman was very smartly dressed, and, as he crossed the hall, with the Baron, ‚Äòdid the man of fashion‚Äô as Saint-Loup would have said in the eyes of the visitors. Indeed, the young page-boys, the L√©vites who were swarming down the temple steps at that moment because it was the time when they came on duty, paid no attention to the two strangers, one of whom, M. de Charlus, kept his eyes lowered to shew that he was paying little if any to them. He appeared to be trying to carve his way through their midst. ‚ÄúProsper, dear hope of a sacred nation,‚Äù he said, recalling a passage from Racine, and applying to it a wholly different meaning. ‚ÄúPardon?‚Äù asked the footman, who was not well up in the classics. M. de Charlus made no reply, for he took a certain pride in never answering questions and in marching straight ahead as though there were no other visitors in the hotel, or no one existed in the world except himself, Baron de Charlus. But, having continued to quote the speech of Josabeth: ‚ÄúCome, come, my children,‚Äù he felt a revulsion and did not, like her, add: ‚ÄúBid them approach,‚Äù for these young people had not yet reached the age at which sex is completely developed, and which appealed to M. de Charlus. Moreover, if he had written to Madame de Chevregny‚Äôs footman, because he had had no doubt of his docility, he had hoped to meet some one more virile. On seeing him, he found him more effeminate than he would have liked. He told him that he had been expecting some one else, for he knew by sight another of Madame de Chevregny‚Äôs footmen, whom he had noticed upon the box of her carriage. This was an extremely rustic type of peasant, the very opposite of him who had come, who, on the other hand, regarding his own effeminate ways as adding to his attractiveness, and never doubting that it was this man-of-the-world air that had captivated M. de Charlus, could not even guess whom the Baron meant. ‚ÄúBut there is no one else in the house, except one that you can‚Äôt have given the eye to, he is hideous, just like a great peasant.‚Äù And at the thought that it was perhaps this rustic whom the Baron had seen, he felt his self-esteem wounded. The Baron guessed this, and, widening his quest: ‚ÄúBut I have not taken a vow that I will know only Mme. de Chevregny‚Äôs men,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSurely there are plenty of fellows in one house or another here or in Paris, since you are leaving soon, that you could introduce to me?‚Äù ‚ÄúOh, no!‚Äù replied the footman, ‚ÄúI never go with anyone of my own class. I only speak to them on duty. But there is one very nice person I can make you know.‚Äù ‚ÄúWho?‚Äù asked the Baron. ‚ÄúThe Prince de Guermantes.‚Äù M. de Guermantes was vexed at being offered only a man so advanced in years, one, moreover, to whom he had no need to apply to a footman for an introduction. And so he declined the offer in a dry tone and, not letting himself be discouraged by the menial‚Äôs social pretensions, began to explain to him again what he wanted, the style, the type, a jockey, for instance, and so on. . . . Fearing lest the solicitor, who went past at that moment, might have heard them, he thought it cunning to shew that he was speaking of anything in the world rather than what his hearer might suspect, and said with emphasis and in ringing tones, but as though he were simply continuing his conversation: ‚ÄúYes, in spite of my age, I still keep up a passion for collecting, a passion for pretty things, I will do anything to secure an old bronze, an early lustre. I adore the Beautiful.‚Äù But to make the footman understand the change of subject he had so rapidly executed, M. de Charlus laid such stress upon each word, and what was more, to be heard by the solicitor, he shouted his words so loud that this charade should in itself have been enough to reveal what it concealed from ears more alert than those of the officer of the court. He suspected nothing, any more than any of the other residents in the hotel, all of whom saw a fashionable foreigner in the footman so smartly attired. On the other hand, if the gentlemen were deceived and took him for a distinguished American, no sooner did he appear before the servants than he was spotted by them, as one convict recognises another, indeed scented afar off, as certain animals scent one another. The head waiters raised their eyebrows. Aim√© cast a suspicious glance. The wine waiter, shrugging his shoulders, uttered behind his hand (because he thought it polite) an offensive expression which everybody heard. And even our old Fran√ßoise, whose sight was failing and who went past at that moment at the foot of the staircase to dine with the courriers, raised her head, recognised a servant where the hotel guests never suspected one ‚Äî as the old nurse Euryclea recognises Ulysses long before the suitors seated at the banquet ‚Äî and seeing, arm in arm with him, M. de Charlus, assumed an appalled expression, as though all of a sudden slanders which she had heard repeated and had not believed had acquired a heartrending probability in her eyes. She never spoke to me, nor to anyone else, of this incident, but it must have caused a considerable commotion in her brain, for afterwards, whenever in Paris she happened to see ‚ÄòJulien,‚Äô to whom until then she had been so greatly attached, she still treated him with politeness, but with a politeness that had cooled and was always tempered with a strong dose of reserve. This same incident led some one else to confide in me: this was Aim√©. When I encountered M. de Charlus, he, not having expected to meet me, raised his hand and called out ‚ÄúGood evening‚Äù with the indifference ‚Äî outwardly, at least ‚Äî of a great nobleman who believes that everything is allowed him and thinks it better not to appear to be hiding anything. Aim√©, who at that moment was watching him with a suspicious eye and saw that I greeted the companion of the person in whom he was certain that he detected a. servant, asked me that same evening who he was. For, for some time past, Aim√© had shewn a fondness for talking, or rather, as he himself put it, doubtless in order to emphasise the character ‚Äî philosophical, according to him ‚Äî of these talks, ‚Äòdiscussing‚Äô with me. And as I often said to him that it distressed me that he should have to stand beside the table while I ate instead of being able to sit down and share my meal, he declared that he had never seen a guest shew such ‚Äòsound reasoning.‚Äô He was talking at that moment to two waiters. They had bowed to me, I did not know why their faces were unfamiliar, albeit their conversation sounded a note which seemed to me not to be novel. Aim√© was scolding them both because of their matrimonial engagements, of which he disapproved. He appealed to me, I said that I could not have any opinion on the matter since I did not know them. They told me their names, reminded me that they had often waited upon me at Rivebelle. But one had let his moustache grow, the other had shaved his off and had had his head cropped; and for this reason, albeit it was the same head as before that rested upon the shoulders of each of them (and not a different head as in the faulty restorations of Notre-Dame), it had remained almost as invisible to me as those objects which escape the most minute search and are actually staring everybody in the face where nobody notices them, on the mantelpiece. As soon as I knew their names, I recognised exactly the uncertain music of their voices because I saw once more the old face which made it clear. ‚ÄúThey want to get married and they haven‚Äôt even learned English!‚Äù Aim√© said to me, without reflecting that I was little versed in the ways of hotel service, and could not be aware that a person who does not know foreign languages cannot be certain of getting a situation. I, who supposed that he would have no difficulty in finding out that the newcomer was M. de Charlus, and indeed imagined that he must remember him, having waited upon him in the dining-room when the Baron came, during my former visit to Balbec, to see Mme. de Villeparisis, I told him his name. Not only did Aim√© not remember the Baron de Charlus, but the name appeared to make a profound impression upon him. He told me that he would look for a letter next day in his room which I might perhaps be able to explain to him. I was all the more astonished in that M. de Charlus, when he had wished to give me one of Bergotte‚Äôs books, at Balbec, the other year, had specially asked for Aim√©, whom he must have recognised later on in that Paris restaurant where I had taken luncheon with Saint-Loup and his mistress and where M. de Charlus had come to spy upon us. It is true that Aim√© had not been able to execute these commissions in person, being on the former occasion in bed, and on the latter engaged in waiting. I had nevertheless grave doubts as to his sincerity, when he pretended not to know M. de Charlus. For one thing, he must have appealed to the Baron. Like all the upstairs waiters of the Balbec Hotel, like several of the Prince de Guermantes‚Äôs footmen, Aim√© belonged to a race more ancient than that of the Prince, therefore more noble. When you asked for a sitting-room, you thought at first that you were alone. But presently, in the service-room you caught sight of a sculptural waiter, of that ruddy Etruscan kind of which Aim√© was typical, slightly aged by excessive consumption of champagne and seeing the inevitable hour approach for Contrex√©ville water. Not all the visitors asked them merely to wait upon them. The underlings who were young, conscientious, busy, who had mistresses waiting for them outside, made off. Whereupon Aim√© reproached them with not being serious. He had every right to do so. He himself was serious. He had a wife and children, and was ambitious on their behalf. And so the advances made to him by a strange lady or gentleman he never repulsed, though it meant his staying all night. For business must come before everything. He was so much of the type that attracted M. de Charlus that I suspected him of falsehood when he told me that he did not know him. I was wrong. The page had been perfectly truthful when he told the Baron that Aim√© (who had given him a dressing-down for it next day) had gone to bed (or gone out), and on the other occasion was busy waiting. But imagination outreaches reality. And the page-boy‚Äôs embarrassment had probably aroused in M. de Charlus doubts as to the sincerity of his excuses that had wounded sentiments of which Aim√© had no suspicion. We have seen moreover that Saint-Loup had prevented Aim√© from going out to the carriage in which M. de Charlus, who had managed somehow or other to discover the waiter‚Äôs new address, received a further disappointment. Aim√©, who had not noticed him, felt an astonishment that may be imagined when, on the evening of that very day on which I had taken luncheon with Saint-Loup and his mistress, he received a letter sealed with the Guermantes arms, from which I shall quote a few passages here as an example of unilateral insanity in an intelligent man addressing an imbecile endowed with sense. ‚ÄúSir, I have been unsuccessful, notwithstanding efforts that would astonish many people who have sought in vain to be greeted and welcomed by myself, in persuading you to listen to certain explanations which you have not asked of me but which I have felt it to be incumbent upon my dignity and your own to offer you. I am going therefore to write down here what it would have been more easy to say to you in person. I shall not conceal from you that, the first time that I set eyes upon you at Balbec, I found your face frankly antipathetic.‚Äù Here followed reflexions upon the resemblance ‚Äî remarked only on the following day ‚Äî to a deceased friend to whom M. de Charlus had been deeply attached. ‚ÄúThe thought then suddenly occurred to me that you might, without in any way encroaching upon the demands of your profession, come to see me and, by joining me in the card games with which his mirth used to dispel my gloom, give me the illusion that he was not dead. Whatever the nature of the more or less fatuous suppositions which you probably formed, suppositions more within the mental range of a servant (who does not even deserve the name of servant since he has declined to serve) than the comprehension of so lofty a sentiment, you probably thought that you were giving yourself importance, knowing not who I was nor what I was, by sending word to me, when I asked you to fetch me a book, that you were in bed; but it is a mistake to imagine that impolite behaviour ever adds to charm, in which you moreover are entirely lacking. I should have ended matters there had I not, by chance, the following morning, found an opportunity of speaking to you. Your resemblance to my poor friend was so accentuated, banishing even the Intolerable protuberance of your too prominent chin, that I realised that it was the deceased who at that moment was lending you his own kindly expression so as to permit you to regain your hold over me and to prevent you from missing the unique opportunity that was being offered you. Indeed, although I have no wish, since there is no longer any object and it is unlikely that I shall meet you again in this life, to introduce coarse questions of material interest, I should have been only too glad to obey the prayer of my dead friend (for I believe in the Communion of Saints and in their deliberate intervention in the destiny of the living), that I should treat you as I used to treat him, who had his carriage, his servants, and to whom it was quite natural that I should consecrate the greater part of my fortune since I loved him as a father loves his son. You have decided otherwise. To my request that you should fetch me a book you sent the reply that you were obliged to go out. And this morning when I sent to ask you to come to my carriage, you then, if I may so speak without blasphemy, denied me for the third time. You will excuse my not enclosing in this envelope the lavish gratuity which I intended to give you at Balbec and to which it would be too painful to me to restrict myself in dealing with a person with whom I had thought for a moment of sharing all that I possess. At least you might spare me the trouble of making a fourth vain attempt to find you at your restaurant, to which my patience will not extend.‚Äù (Here M. de Charlus gave his address, stated the hours at which he would be at home, etc.) ‚ÄúFarewell, Sir. Since I assume that, resembling so strongly the friend whom I have lost, you cannot be entirely stupid, otherwise physiognomy would be a false science, I am convinced that if, one day, you think of this incident again, it will not be without feeling some regret and some remorse. For my part, believe that I am quite sincere in saying that I retain no bitterness. I should have preferred that we should part with a less unpleasant memory than this third futile endeavour. It will soon be forgotten. We are like those vessels which you must often have seen at Balbec, which have crossed one another‚Äôs course for a moment; it might have been to the advantage of each of them to stop; but one of them has decided otherwise; presently they will no longer even see one another on the horizon and their meeting is a thing out of mind; but, before this final parting, each of them salutes the other, and so at this point, Sir, wishing you all good fortune, does
¬†¬†¬†THE BARON DE CHARLUS.‚Äù
¬†¬†¬†Aim√© had not even read this letter through, being able to make nothing of it and suspecting a hoax. When I had explained to him who the Baron was, he appeared to be lost in thought and to be feeling the regret that M. de Charlus had anticipated. I would not be prepared to swear that he would not at that moment have written a letter of apology to a man who gave carriages to his friends. But in the interval M. de Charlus had made Morel‚Äôs acquaintance. It was true that, his rela",en,LABEL_0,0.49115341901779175,LABEL_1,0.5088465809822083

Homesick for LA
In the summer of my life
That‚Äôs when‚ÄÖwe‚ÄÖfirst met

When I first saw you, I made a mixtape
I didn't know you'd do the same damn thing
When I said goodbye to you, it went quiet
'Cause I didn't wanna feel any pain

The last thing I want is another debutante
To take me away from my world
(Take me away from my world)
And I know that wasn't us, but it still got tough
So come on, come on

And tell me, why'd you have to have such a damn good taste in music?
Yeah, if all my favorite songs make me think of you
I'm gonna lose it

When we drove up the coast, we had a soundtrack
We made it feel like a film on a reel
And our story didn't have a happy ending
But it still sounded good, despite the way I feel

The last thing I want is another broken heart
To drive me to the brink of crazy
In the end I couldn't take it, 'cause I knew we wouldn't make it

Kanye West, Rihanna, and Sir Paul McCartney made a song, Canadians ruled the charts (Drake, The Weeknd, Justin Bieber and Alessia Cara), and old favorites like Adele and Dr. Dre actually released new music. Who would have thought? Here are the 50 best songs of 2015. ‚Äî Michael Heal50. Adele ‚Äì ‚ÄúHello‚ÄùAdele‚Äôs commercially groundbreaking comeback track from her 2012 Oscar-winning ‚ÄúSkyfall‚Äù oozes nostalgia, careful lyricism, and a panging sense of regret. The sepia sibling to the 2011 monochromatic smash hit ‚ÄúSomeone Like You,"" ‚ÄúHello‚Äù is a story of reflection and growth. Equipped with luscious production that perfectly complements Adele‚Äôs melodramatic, longing vocals, the track swells with an immense grandeur, soulful and impossibly powerful. Already the subject of a viral SNL skit, the track has landed firmly in the graces of pop culture, a testament to Adele‚Äôs massive cultural legacy. Unforgettable and devastatingly timeless, ‚ÄúHello‚Äù is surely among Adele‚Äôs growing catalogue of classics.
‚Äî serein49. Dr. Dre feat. Marsha Ambrosius, King Mez & Kendrick Lamar ‚Äì ‚ÄúDarkside/Gone‚Äù‚ÄúDarkside/Gone‚Äù features two instrumentals, and three generations of Aftermath in just one song. King Mez takes the first verse, giving us an insight into the future of rap as the offspring of Cole and Kendrick. He‚Äôs followed by the veteran Dr. Dre, who summarizes his illustrious career in two verses. Saving the best ‚Äòtill last, Kendrick Lamar employs a  jaw-dropping flow on one of his best features in a minute. We never thought we‚Äôd see another after Eminem, but the kid from Compton is quickly climbing his way to the top of Dre‚Äôs list of prot√©g√©s.
‚Äî Vuk Aleksiƒá48. Lin-Manuel Miranda feat. Original Broadway Cast of Hamilton ‚Äì Hamilton's ‚ÄúAlexander Hamilton‚ÄùWhen Tony-winning Lin-Manuel Miranda picked up an 800-page biography of first US Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton, he became convinced within 50 pages that this man's life deserved an epic hip-hop musical. The idea may look ridiculous on paper, but ""Alexander Hamilton"" is an undeniable proof-of-concept. Starting with only the briefest instrumentation, the song builds from a nearly acapella verse venemously spit by Hamilton's lifelong rival to a virtuosic chorus that relates‚Äîwith an exhilarating immediacy for events that happened 200+ years ago‚Äîthe combination hardship and hustle that would propel Hamilton out of his impoverished Caribbean hometown and into 18th (and now 21st) century American superstardom. ‚Äî epaulettes47. Halsey ‚Äì ‚ÄúDrive‚ÄùWhile it‚Äôs far from the most popular song on Halsey‚Äôs debut, ‚ÄúDrive‚Äù may be the most vivid. Halsey described the track as ‚Äúmore unique‚Äù and ‚Äúuninhibited‚Äù. Her personal account of a slow-burning relationship is sung to the tune of an engine, with car keys, ‚Äúdoor ajar‚Äù beeps, rain and a cassette player serving as ad-libs. With such picturesque elements, it‚Äôs not hard to get lost in this hyperrealistic setting. ‚Äî streetlights46. Chance the Rapper feat. Saba ‚Äì ‚ÄúAngels‚ÄùChance the Rapper took the nation by storm on October 26th, performing ‚ÄúAngels‚Äù live on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert with fellow buzzing Chicago artist, Saba. Through the acrobatic frontflips, the flashing lights, and the animated dance moves, it truly was the music that stood out. The muffled, yet soulful vocals, vibrant steel drums, and accompanying instrumentation from the Social Experiment set the stage for Chance and Saba to shine, speaking on the untimely deaths seen each day in Chicago. After shouting out Chicago radio stations, radio took notice, and an independent artist made waves across the nation. Catch up with the nation, and do your best juke to ‚ÄúAngels."" ‚Äî Mattw11645. Jme feat. Gigg's ‚Äì ‚ÄúMan Don‚Äôt Care‚ÄùKanye West‚Äôs performance of ‚ÄúAll Day‚Äù at the BRIT Awards, surrounded by two guys with flame throwers and some of the biggest names in grime, foreshadowed UK rap‚Äôs explosive growth in 2015. Veteran Tottenham MC Jme dropped his third and most commercially successful album, Integrity this summer, and ‚ÄúMan Don‚Äôt Care‚Äù quickly became its biggest track. With production from Swifta Beater that‚Äôs as ruthless as the bars Jme and a snarling Giggs spit over it, ‚ÄúMan Don‚Äôt Care‚Äù not only stands out in the grime scene, but is one of the hottest bangers of 2015.
‚Äî BasedGator44. Susanne Sundfor - ""Delirious""Most anti-love songs involve the artist as the victim. However, Norwegian singer Susanne Sundf√∏r plays the perpetrator with the power of a show-stopping villain. Cinematic violins make way to a foreboding 80s arpeggiator, as Sundf√∏r self-harmonizes through her key changes. The words ‚ÄúI told you not to come, my victim #1‚Äù drives the point home. ‚Äî Chihuahua043. Viet Cong - ‚ÄúDeath‚ÄùDrake, The Weeknd and Justin Bieber had monster mainstream years, but based on creativity alone, Viet Cong were Canada‚Äôs musical MVPs in 2015. ‚ÄúDeath‚Äù perfectly encapsulates their triumphant d√©but album. The first three minutes are led by a jingling, Donovan-esque guitar riff. Then the tempo kicks up a gear, and a real sense of dissonance and unease creeps in. Mike Wallace‚Äôs phenomenal drum work drives the song on, whilst Matt Flegel succeeds where a hundred post-punk vocalists failed and perfectly captures the spirit of Ian Curtis of Joy Division. It‚Äôs four songs in one, and all of them are gems. ‚Äî Vesuvius42. Joey Bada$$ ‚Äì ‚ÄúPaper Trail$‚ÄùThe real intro to B4.Da.$$ sums up the title of the album perfectly. Backed by a soulful beat by DJ Premier and trademark scratches, ""Paper Trail$"" sees Joey realize money ruined everything around him. He noticed his friends become vanity slaves, and forced himself to be different. The song is a serious complaint against late capitalist culture, delivered with so much honesty that it makes us wonder if Joey will ever sign a major label contract - even if it is for 3 million dollars.  ‚Äî Sem Groeneweg41. Rihanna feat. Kanye West & Paul McCartney ‚Äì ‚ÄúFourFiveSeconds‚ÄùRihanna is, by all counts, a pop gamechanger. An artist that is constantly revamping her image and style, the Barbadian singer‚Äôs ‚ÄúFourFiveSeconds‚Äù is probably the closest thing in her discography to a folk track. With its acoustic, minimalist production, and set of visceral vocals, ‚ÄúFourFiveSeconds‚Äù is a sure example of Rihanna‚Äôs versatility and daringness - the record is no doubt the very antithesis of the great majority of her work. Backed by Kanye West and Paul McCartney, fresh off their ‚ÄúOnly One‚Äù collab, ‚ÄúFourFiveSeconds‚Äù is simple, timeless, and a hangover ode for the ages. ‚Äî serein40. Carly Rae Jepsen ‚Äì ‚ÄúRun Away with Me‚ÄùBacked up by a blaring horn hook, one of the year‚Äôs best pop singles comes from none other than the girl who wants you to call her (maybe) - Carly Rae Jepsen. Yet ‚ÄúRun‚Äù isn‚Äôt just the typical bubblegum pop we‚Äôd expect from Jepsen; it‚Äôs a massive, exuberant track with a bold chorus that functions as a supersaturated one-way ticket to the 80s. Jet-setting, nostalgic, and impossibly ecstatic, the dance-pop summer anthem infectiously demands the love and attention that it wholesomely deserves. ‚Äî serein39. Post Malone ‚Äì ‚ÄúWhite Iverson‚ÄùThis track put Post Malone on the map by dominating autumn and now winter playlists. While modern in its sound, ""White Iverson"" is a work of nostalgia‚Äîa throwback to a bygone era when every NBA star sported cornrows and fancied himself an MC. Post and producer 1st Down used this theme as the backbone for a smooth, sultry, yet plaintive ode to his own sauce.  ‚Äî $haz38. Vince Staples feat Snoh Aalegra ‚Äì ‚ÄúJump Off The Roof‚ÄùSummertime ‚Äò06 is incorrigibly bleak; when paralleled with To Pimp a Butterfly, its inclusive, rallying, and uplifting thematic sister, it becomes an unnerving product of black desolation. There is little room for repose or solace in Vince Staples‚Äôs vision, and no song highlights his jagged-edged, bareboned hardness better than ‚ÄúJump off the Roof,‚Äù a four minute master-showing of music‚Äôs most visceral brand of introspective realism. Like Ice Cube, Vince‚Äôs lyrical power comes from plainspoken sharpness: ‚ÄúI pray to God cause I need him, I need him, I need him,‚Äù Vince raps over impeccably howling production; we need no elaboration to feel its force.
‚Äî XerXes37. Clarence Clarity ‚Äì ‚ÄúThose Who Can‚Äôt, Cheat‚Äù‚ÄúThose Who Can‚Äôt, Cheat‚Äù, likely the catchiest tune off Clarence Clarity‚Äôs debut album No Now, may also be the most cryptic. Through R&B and pop influenced the melodies, Clarence tells the tale of a cheating lover while simultaneously explaining that our time on this earth is limited, relating to what might be the theme of the whole album: live life, as we never know what the future might hold. Watch this strange universe unfold on ‚ÄúThose Who Can‚Äôt, Cheat."" ‚Äî Mattw11636. Towkio feat. Lido, Chance The Rapper & Eryn Allen Kane ‚Äì ‚ÄúHeaven Only Knows‚ÄùFour young talents, accompanied by a hook interpolated from John Legend's ""Heaven"" combine to create a divine and heavenly track. ""Heaven Only Knows""  hosts an electric, multi-layered hook, and a strong opening verse from Towkio ‚Äì as he declares SAVEMONEY ‚Äúan army full of generals‚Äù. If this weren‚Äôt enough, Chance The Rapper drops a feature verse delivered so rapidly with such a condense and varying rhyme scheme, Lido literally ups the tempo to match it. And that‚Äôs why, for those reasons and more...I love it, I love it, love it, I love it, love it, I love it‚Äî Skhills35. Jay Rock ‚Äì ‚ÄúGumbo‚ÄùReal flavour is hard to come by these days but TDE‚Äôs Jay Rock delivered with standout single, ""Gumbo"". The strength of the song lies in the hidden references to his youth. The song title for example, refers to his grandmother's Gumbo; ""The flavor, it tastes so good. It was an analogy with music‚Äù he told Genius. Similar to ""Fly On The Wall,"" Rock shows a vulnerable side of life in the projects. Realizing how personal ""Gumbo"" is makes it even more fascinating. ‚Äî Sem Groeneweg34. Wolf Alice ‚Äì ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre A Germ‚ÄùSince bursting to prominence with ‚ÄúMoaning Lisa Smile‚Äù in early 2014, Wolf Alice have been hailed as the instigators of a new wave of British grunge. Although they‚Äôve distanced themselves from that label, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre A Germ‚Äù is their most grunge song yet. Its quiet introduction presents biker Georgie, who uses his age to impress schoolgirls. Then the behemoth of a chorus, complete with a monstrous count-in, tears him down; he‚Äôs a ‚Äúdodgy fucker‚Äù, doomed to become a washed up rocker and ultimately get dragged down to Hell. It‚Äôs like Cobain at his best. ‚Äî Vesuvius33. The Weeknd ‚Äì ‚ÄúTell Your Friends‚ÄùOf all the songs on Beauty Behind The Madness, ‚ÄúTell Your Friends‚Äù is one of the few non-pop records. Kanye West & co samples Soul Dog‚Äôs 1976 song ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt Stop Loving You..‚Äù to blend soul and rock effortlessly, as Abel opens up about self destruction, chasing fame, drugs, and of course, women. ‚ÄúThey told me not to fall in love, that shit is pointless‚Äù he croons, just moments before Mike Dean rips his best guitar solo since ‚ÄúDevil In A New Dress.‚Äù Want to impress your friends this holiday season? Tell them about this song.
‚Äî Michael Heal32. Florence + The Machine ‚Äì ‚ÄúDelilah‚ÄùIn ‚ÄúDelilah,‚Äù Florence Welch takes the phone call that she never received from her lover, and elevates it into a modern biblical adaptation. The baroque-pop stomper anchors the anguish with a clap-accompanied drum, piano chords, and throaty brass that exhales as Welch proclaims ‚ÄúI‚Äôm calling for my mother, as I pull the pillars down.‚Äù When she finishes with the words ‚ÄúThese chains never leave me, I keep dragging them around,‚Äù her falsetto ‚Äî and the bouncing cello ‚Äî devastes. ‚Äî Chihuahua031. Joanna Newsom ‚Äì ‚ÄúSapokanikan‚ÄùThe best candidate for this millennium‚Äôs Bard, Joanna Newsom works best when she‚Äôs able to transform complex poetic devices into a singalong, as evinced by ‚ÄúSapokanikan‚Äù. She begins by referring to ‚ÄúOzymandias‚Äù and the futility of creating art. Ironic, considering  she created some of the most lasting music of 2015. The stunning piano piece complete with drums is an epistemic journey where every listener comes away knowing something new.  ‚Äî Brian Duricy30. Justin Bieber ‚Äì ‚ÄúWhat Do You Mean?‚ÄùBieber Fever hit an all-time high prior to the release of ‚ÄúWhat Do You Mean?‚Äù thanks to a month packed with promotion from Justin‚Äôs high-profile friends. The unique rollout proved worthwhile, as the song became his first ever number one single. The now-ubiquitous Bieber crooning is complimented by one Mason Levy, who adds in a syncopated synth rhythm along with that catchy clock beat. Meanwhile, maturity is shown in the lyrics -- when would you ever think the ‚ÄúBaby‚Äù singer would ever get real about arguing and makeup sex? Although the song highlights indecision, there‚Äôs none on our end - ‚ÄúWhat Do You Mean?‚Äù is one of our favorite tracks of the year. ‚Äî streetlights29. Skepta ‚Äì ‚ÄúShutdown‚ÄùGrime was first introduced to the American blogosphere in 2003, but the last 12 months have seen the genre make a serious overseas crossover thanks to cosigns from hip-hop‚Äôs reigning tastemakers, Kanye West and Drake. Sensing the moment, Skepta released one of the most zeitgeisty grime songs yet. While armed with a Drake sample and a media reaction to Kanye‚Äôs ‚ÄúAll Day‚Äù Brit Awards performance, this song completely belongs to Skepta. The frantic beat suits his energetic style, spitting tough bars while speaking the same language as Man Booker Prize winner Marlon James‚Äô book A Brief History of Seven Killings, with both having no time for ‚Äúyour -ism and schisms.‚Äù No, Skepta‚Äôs only got time for making the most of his moment, something he does completely on ‚ÄúShutdown."" ‚Äî Brian Duricy28. Tame Impala ‚Äì ‚ÄúLet It Happen‚ÄùKevin Parker described this song as ‚Äútotally different from anything ever.‚Äù Are we sure that‚Äôs hyperbole? From the auditory Rorschach test  in the bridge, to the inexplicable record skips that would feel serendipitous if Parker‚Äôs master-planner reputation didn‚Äôt precede him, ‚ÄúLet It Happen‚Äù sounds as much like the soundtrack to the apocalypse as it does the first notes of a glorious new wave. Synth-heavy and sensual, moody and meticulous, ‚ÄúLet It Happen‚Äù was the perfect sonic and thematic intro to an album birthed by surrendering to desires. ‚Äî Heisenferg27. Sufjan Stevens ‚Äì ‚ÄúBlue Bucket of Gold‚ÄùCarrie & Lowell finds Sufjan Stevens stripped bare, trading his usual experimental instrumentation for minimalism, focusing attention on the devastatingly personal delivery of his mother‚Äôs passing. The album‚Äôs final track, ‚ÄúBlue Bucket of Gold,‚Äù begins much the same: plodding piano keys and the fuzzy warmth of Sufjan‚Äôs voice draws the listener in with its intimacy, belying the metaphor of loss and ghostly backing vocals that threaten to knock you out cold. Sufjan asks for answers, and pleas for the impossible, as the album seems to fizzle to a bleak conclusion, swallowed by its own grief. Just then, the ethereal drone crescendos out of nowhere, its oscillations washing over like a wave of catharsis, providing comfort where words have fallen short. In the face of death, hope springs eternal. ‚Äî Brock Chenier26. Travi$ Scott feat. Justin Bieber & Young Thug ‚Äì ‚ÄúMaria I‚Äôm Drunk‚ÄùWhile many made a lot of Antidote, which features all the typical hooks and beats that you‚Äôd expect from a banger, Rodeo‚Äôs true work of art is a very cool and calculated two-parter. Maria sets the tone perfectly, offering a slow but captivating atmosphere that allows I‚Äôm Drunk to wash over you for a night‚Äôs cruise. This song also features a surprisingly well incorporated Justin Bieber verse, showing his newfound prominence within the hip-hop industry through his newly developed range: ‚ÄúGirl I want you on the rocks, no chaser, Be sure to drink it all, won't waste ya.‚Äù ‚Äî Zachary ‚Äúthezachman1‚Äù Mahabir25. Drake ‚Äì ‚ÄúBack to Back‚Äù‚ÄúBack to Back‚Äù was the biggest hip-hop event of 2015. The first diss song to be nominated for a Grammy had timelines ablaze and has so far, garnered over 105 million Soundcloud plays. Everyone knew Drake was waiting for a chance to prove himself. Everyone except Meek Mill, who fired off a series of Tweets claiming Drake didn‚Äôt write his own raps. ‚ÄúIs that a world tour or your girls tour?‚Äù Drake clapped back over the Noah ‚Äú40‚Äù Shebib laced beat, as the punchlines kept rolling in: ‚ÄúYeah, trigger fingers turn to twitter fingers / Yeah, you gettin' bodied by a singin' nigga.‚Äù Meek‚Äôs career hung by a thread. The Drizzy Drake we knew was gone. The 6ix God was born. ‚Äî Michael Heal24. Father John Misty ‚Äì ‚ÄúThe Night Josh Tillman Came To Our Apartment‚ÄùIn the middle of a collection of beautiful unapologetic love songs, ‚ÄúThe Night Josh Tillman Came To Our Apartment‚Äù stands out. It‚Äôs an anti-love song, in which our weary narrator complains about his lover‚Äôs annoying habits. Some lyrics are biting, with sarcasm dripping off them, others are understated and subtle. The result is a song which complements, rather than contradicts, the central message of I Love You, Honeybear.  It‚Äôs Tillman‚Äôs greatest songwriting achievement yet. ‚Äî Vesuvius23. Kendrick Lamar ‚Äì ‚ÄúAlright‚ÄùA rap song has never won ‚ÄúSong of the Year‚Äù at the Grammys, but Kendrick Lamar‚Äôs ‚ÄúAlright‚Äù might be the first. The song isn‚Äôt just a catchy, Pharrell produced banger, it‚Äôs socially aware. We‚Äôre angry: ‚ÄúWe hate po-po / Wanna kill us dead in the street fo sho‚Äù - we‚Äôre tired: ‚ÄúI'm at the preacher's door / My knees gettin' weak, and my gun might blow - but we have hope: ‚ÄúBut we gon' be alright!‚Äù Black Lives Matter protesters evened chanted the hook during the 20th Anniversary Celebration of Million Man March in Washington D.C. Kendrick Lamar managed to capture the emotions of a nation, and evidently the world in three and a half minutes. No award can match that. ‚Äî Michael Heal22. Beach House ‚Äì ‚ÄúSpace Song‚ÄùThough many tracks on Depression Cherry may seem to ‚Äúblend‚Äù, ‚ÄúSpace Song‚Äù is a true standout. While Beach House‚Äôs classic use of drones pulls you into the song, it‚Äôs the magnificent riffs that keep you there. These riffs promote an ambivalent feeling. On one hand they represent sorrowful cries, capable of breaking down whatever wall you might place against it, but on the other, they represent a hypnotic happiness. Contemplate ‚Äúwhat makes this fragile world go round‚Äù as Beach House transports you to a new one on ‚ÄúSpace Song."" ‚Äî Mattw11621. Snakehips feat. Chance The Rapper & Tinashe ‚Äì ‚ÄúAll My Friends‚ÄùDrunk on a Friday night? Look no further than the infectious ‚ÄúAll My Friends.‚Äù The soaring chorus and hypnotic synths create a party anthem with a twist. Tinashe delivers a standout vocal performance complete with vulture metaphors, while Chance the Rapper spits a sweet sixteen entirely about the effects of Xanax. You can‚Äôt escape the irony of one liners like: ‚ÄúThe nights we won't remember / Are the nights we won't remember‚Äù in a society where today's youth consider ‚Äúturning up‚Äù on their list of basic human rights. ‚Äî Michael Heal20. Future ‚Äì ‚ÄúMarch Madness‚ÄùLively and anthemic, this Tarentino-produced track was the highlight of Future's best project in a year he dominated, releasing 2 Billboard #1 albums in the span of 3 months. In addition to his usual drug references, Future takes the time to acknowledge a societal ill that has particular personal significance to him, as he laments ""all these cops shooting niggas tragic"". Celebratory yet conscientious, it is, as its title suggests, an encapsulation of America at its best. ‚Äî $haz19. Drake ‚Äì ‚ÄúHotline Bling‚ÄùDrake‚Äôs ‚ÄúHotline Bling‚Äù has dominated the latter half of 2015 thanks to its simplistic but captivating beat and incredibly infectious hook. The song quickly became the most culturally impactful anthem of the year and earned Drake his highest charting single since 2009‚Äôs ‚ÄúBest I Ever Had.‚Äù The song‚Äôs popularity only grew with the release of its music video, which quickly became an internet sensation, inspiring a multitude of memes and sparking playful discussion around Aubrey‚Äôs questionable dance moves. Drizzy successfully delivers a fresh sound while still providing us with one of his his classic ex-lover narratives.. ‚Äî shy-ink18. Lupe Fiasco feat. Ayesha Jaco ‚Äì ‚ÄúPrisoner 1 & 2‚ÄùIt‚Äôs hard to believe that a story of mistreated prisoners, jealous guards, and an artist‚Äôs conflict with a record label could be told in 9 minutes. Lupe Fiasco, however, is not your average lyricist. On the string-driven side of ‚ÄúPrisoner 1‚Äù, Lupe details the tragedy of the ‚Äúnew Jim Crow‚Äù until the song breaks down to the sound of menacing grunts and pleas to be freed, leading towards ‚ÄúPrisoner 2‚Äù, where the guards abuse their privileges to feel powerful, only to realize they‚Äôre trapped as well. In classic Lupe style, the metaphorical subplot runs deep. Click here for the Genius annotated page. You‚Äôre welcome. ‚Äî Mattw11617. Miguel ‚Äì ‚ÄúWaves‚ÄùWhile it wasn‚Äôt the lead single on Wildheart, Miguel‚Äôs ‚ÄúWaves‚Äù proved to be a fan favorite. The booming instrumentation shines bright alongside Miguel‚Äôs fiery delivery that seems to endlessly intensify, leading up to a passionate-frenzy of an outro. Compared to ‚ÄúCoffee‚Äù, this song shines bright when performed live, the rocking guitars amplify even further while the crowd emulates Miguel‚Äôs enormous energy. Always experimenting with ways to push the genre forward, Miguel masters the crossover between Rock and R&B to create an anthemic soundtrack to our summer. ‚Äî shy-ink16. Jack √ú feat. Justin Bieber ‚Äì ‚ÄúWhere Are √ú Now‚ÄùWhile ""Where Are √ú Now"" is the brain-child of Skrillex & Diplo, the super-producer duo behind Jack √ú , it's Justin Bieber who steals the show with an outstanding comeback vocal performance. ‚ÄúWhere Are √ú Now‚Äù marks Bieber‚Äôs transition from cliched teen pop songs to sonically and lyrically interesting music. Fluttering synths, deep bass, and a flute riff that is actually Bieber‚Äôs voice anoint the song--the best traits of Skrillex and Diplo. As Bieber croons about an ex (guess who), we can only wonder: where has mature Justin been all our lives?  ‚Äî Babu Sea15. A$AP Rocky feat. Bones ‚Äì ‚ÄúCanal St.‚Äù‚ÄúCanal St.‚Äù featuring Bones is that vibe, and by no accident either. Imagine A$AP Rocky treading down Canal St. towards Mercer with his hood up and head down, watching the rain splash off his vintage leather boots smoking a blunt in the dead of night. The hustler's sermon is delivered over a stripped back, smoldering beat looping in and out of Bones‚Äô hook. As Rocky snarls ‚Äúheard the people want that raw shit, but y'all be talkin' bullshit‚Äù to end the second verse, we realize what we just heard was most definitely the former ‚Äî Michael Heal14. Courtney Barnett ‚Äì ‚ÄúPedestrian At Best‚ÄùAt first listen, ‚ÄúPedestrian At Best‚Äù is organized chaos. Witty bars on fame and philosophy are thrown into crashing guitar riffs. The execution might seem awkward at first, but lyrics like ‚ÄúPut me on a pedestal / and I‚Äôll only disappoint you‚Äù and ‚ÄúI think you‚Äôre a joke / but I don‚Äôt find you very funny‚Äù are some of the most poignant and hilarious lines of the year. Barnett doesn‚Äôt need to worry about her fame falling through - songs like these will certainly keep her afloat. ‚Äî Babu Sea13. Major Lazer feat. DJ Snake & M√ò ‚Äì ‚ÄúLean On""‚ÄúLean On‚Äù mashes EDM, reggae, and traditional Indian sounds into a dancefloor ballad about taking on love‚Äôs difficulties. Danish darling M√ò brings plenty to the table as the vocalist, melting into the words ‚ÄúBut the nights are long, longing for you to come home.‚Äù Staccato synths and a chipmunked riff complete the presentation of one of the world‚Äôs biggest Songs of the Summer. ‚Äî Chihuahua012. Alessia Cara ‚Äì ‚ÄúHere‚Äù""Here"" functions as the ultimate introvert-anthem. In a world where mainstream pop music largely celebrates and glorifies the party lifestyle, newcomer Alessia Cara sheds light on the other side of the spectrum. Antisocials of society can find comfort in the idea that a rising star feels the same way as they do. Melodic throughout, ‚ÄúHere‚Äù is perfect for radio, but also has the storytelling chops of a deeper cut, drawing the listener in and allowing thought-provoking lyrical content to take center stage. ‚ÄúHere‚Äù is for those who want to kick it to music with a message. ‚Äî ScopeY11. Natalie Prass ‚Äì ‚ÄúMy Baby Don‚Äôt Understand Me‚Äù‚ÄúI don‚Äôt feel much‚Äù. These words from Natalie Prass introduce the heartbreaking ‚ÄúMy Baby Don‚Äôt Understand Me‚Äù. A few quiet piano chords are initially accompanied only by brief woodwind notes. As the song‚Äôs story of heartbreak progresses, it crescendos, not once, but twice, with more and more instruments coming in. ‚ÄúOur love is a long goodbye/we keep waiting for the train to cry‚Äù, Prass sings, as the song reaches a glorious, tear-jerking peak. More, and soon, please. ‚Äî Vesuvius10. Grimes ‚Äì ‚ÄúKill V. Maim‚ÄùA song written from the point of view of a ‚Äúvampire, space-travelling Al Pacino from The Godfather Part 2 who can change gender,‚Äù ""Kill V. Maim"" is as eccentric of a piece as its perspective suggests. Boucher‚Äôs delivery and production are in a constant state of flux, yet melt and cohere into a glorious final product. It‚Äôs hyperactive; she moves from articulated statements into accented growls, and from taunting cheerleader chants to genderbent rebellion. The song‚Äôs a prime example of forward-thinking pop, breaking down expectations with every turn and interstellar sound effect. Fun, unexpected, and a total wild card - it‚Äôs undeniably Grimes. ‚Äî Tyler Yan (LanaDelReyquaza)9. Jamie xx feat. Romy Madley Croft ‚Äì ‚ÄúLoud Places‚ÄùOn ‚ÄúLoud Places,‚Äù Jamie xx recruits former bandmate Romy to essentially create a new xx song, something fans have patiently awaited since 2012. ‚ÄúLoud Places‚Äù is a song of antithesis: searching for peace in the most rowdy of places, expressing love with no reciprocation, elevating past the clouds yet plummeting so low. Sampling Idris Muhammad‚Äôs ‚ÄúCould Heaven Ever Be Like This,‚Äù Jamie seamlessly blends old and new, creating music that truly transcends. ‚Äî Mattw1168. Kendrick Lamar ‚Äì ‚ÄúThe Blacker the Berry‚Äù‚ÄúI‚Äôm the biggest hypocrite of 2015!‚Äù Kendrick Lamar screams on ‚ÄúThe Blacker The Berry‚Äù as he rages over a raw Boi-1da instrumental. The song is the purest hip-hop track on To Pimp A Butterfly - a refreshing break on an album filled with chaotic jazz and G-funk production.
On a song that‚Äôs accusatory, yet self-reflecting; provocative, yet self-containing, Kendrick accurately points out how the problems addressed on the record are not just black and white. He tries to engage with every side of the discussion by emphasizing black on black violence is just as common as any other form of violence. Hypocrite? Yes, but Kendrick makes hypocrisy seem like a natural response - maybe even an inevitable one. ‚Äî Steven Fr√∂lke7. Beach House ‚Äì ‚ÄúLevitation‚ÄùA pound of feathers, or a pound of lead ‚Äì which is heavier? Beach House has consistently found themselves on the former end of the common riddle, layering airy synths and organs behind Victoria Legrand‚Äôs buoyant voice to create music that seemingly hovers over the listener. But don‚Äôt mistake lightweight for superficial; a pound of feathers is still a pound, after all, and music this light on its toes is far from punchless in its qualitative or emotional weight. ‚ÄúLevitation‚Äù bubbles with hope in the face of the unknown. Even as they duly note the looming dread of uncertainty with metaphors of aging, they don‚Äôt leave you hanging; uplifting organs and Alex Scally‚Äôs momentous guitar riffs burst through the fear with a warm incandescence that could soundtrack a sunrise, as Legrand promises to take you away from all the darkness, inviting you to elope into her soothing arms. ‚Äî Brock Chenier6. D'Angelo ‚Äì ‚ÄúReally Love‚ÄùD‚ÄôAngelo‚Äôs ‚ÄúReally Love‚Äù has existed since 2007, and on the Black Messiah version of the track, he fittingly makes us wait more than two minutes before his voice is heard. The Latin funk guitar plucks serve as a transition from a whispered Spanish lover‚Äôs query, foreshadowing the intimate softness of D‚ÄôAngelo‚Äôs singing. Lyrically, the song aspires to a higher order of love, that of ‚Äúreally‚Äù love. On an album concerned with vital, heavy topics like police brutality, D‚ÄôAngelo showcases his capacity for romance nearly two decades after releasing his classic debut LP Brown Sugar. It‚Äôs (really) refreshing. ‚Äî Brian Duricy5. The Weeknd ‚Äì ‚ÄúThe Hills‚ÄùHorror-influenced in theme and sound, ‚ÄúThe Hills‚Äù was an unlikely breakout hit, a throwback to Abel‚Äôs mixtape period ‚Äî in stark contrast to the Max Martin-penned MJ impression ""Can't Feel My Face."" It initially surfaced during a SXSW performance, immediately stirring up anticipation for The Weeknd‚Äôs 2015 domination. The track builds to the brutally honest hook and crescendos into a punishing low end. Additional eerie vibes and atmospheric feel combine for one of the most addictive songs of the year. Half past five will never be the same again. ‚Äî $haz4. Kanye West feat. Paul McCartney ‚Äì ‚ÄúOnly One‚Äù‚ÄúNo you‚Äôre not perfect but you‚Äôre not your mistakes‚Äù are words to live by. And if anyone knows, it‚Äôs Kanye Omari West. On Ye‚Äôs most personal song since 2008‚Äôs 808‚Äôs & Heartbreak, he draws parallels to The Beatles‚Äô ‚ÄúLet It Be‚Äù - a song written by Sir Paul McCartney after waking from a dream about his late mother. Some 45 years later, McCartney joins West as he sings a strikingly beautiful, incredibly stark Auto-Tuned ballad to his daughter North. Kanye claimed he couldn‚Äôt remember the song when the lines were played to him, and concluded it was a message from his late mother, Donda West. Considering Ye delivered ‚ÄúOnly One‚Äù on the first day of the year, here‚Äôs hoping he starts 2016 in the same fashion. ‚Äî Michael Heal3. Sufjan Stevens ‚Äì ‚ÄúFourth Of July‚ÄùClosing the first side of Carrie and Lowell, ‚ÄúFourth of July‚Äù sees Sufjan Stevens summoned to his estranged mother‚Äôs deathbed. Over quiet piano chords, Carrie pleads with her ‚Äúlittle Versailles‚Äù for his forgiveness, and tries to console him by reminding him of the inevitability of death. Sufjan covers a tremendous amount of emotional ground over the minimalist production, searching desperately for what he ‚Äúcould have said to raise you from the dead‚Äù. It‚Äôs incredibly honest, and easily one of the most affecting songs of the year. ‚Äî  Vesuvius2. Kendrick Lamar ‚Äì ‚Äúu‚ÄùThis visceral cut from album of the year To Pimp a Butterfly is an intense, disturbing listen. Rather than the the self-loving ‚Äúi‚Äù, ‚Äúu‚Äù serves as the self-loathing antithesis. Kendrick gives unrestricted access to his tormented soul as he raps about his sixteen year old sister falling pregnant and FaceTiming his childhood friend Chad Keaton in hospital while he was away on tour. This comes in an intense fit of drunken rage we‚Äôre not used to seeing from Lamar, but it ultimately makes for a more impactful song. From the haunting screams, gripping internal struggle and manic state, Kendrick tackles depression head on. Loving ""u"" is complicated.
‚Äî Michael Heal1. Jamie xx feat. Popcaan & Young Thug ‚Äì ‚ÄúI Know There‚Äôs Gonna Be (Good Times)‚ÄùA 2014 NC State study found that ‚Äúgood‚Äù and ‚Äútime‚Äù are two of the most frequently used words in hit songs, and  ‚ÄúI Know There‚Äôs Gonna Be (Good Times)‚Äù abides by those statistics without ever falling into triteness. The cut from Jamie xx‚Äôs solo debut features a fusion of steel drums, infectious dancehall vocals and a soulful sample derived from The Persuasions song of the same name. Perhaps the most key element, however, is the warbled euphoria of Young Thug, who contributes not only in the form of absurdly creative lyrics, but as an instrument, melodically intertwining with Jamie‚Äôs lush production. These disparate pieces blend to perfection to form a masterpiece worthy of it‚Äôs own EP. Wherever and whenever this song‚Äôs playing, we know there‚Äôs gonna be good times. ‚Äî streetlightsCheck out the Genius Community's 20 Best Albums of 2015 here.35Embed",en,LABEL_0,0.49733471870422363,LABEL_1,0.5026652812957764

Now you can close your eyes
Leave all the world behind until tomorrow

The dream is like a song
It leads you on and on

And though another day
May steal your dreams away

Poseidon became lord of earthquake and seas
Master of oceans and all their wealth
God of an island, there lived a family
With a daughter of beauty and health
Atlantis was the island's name
Greatest treasury of all times

Silver and gold, fertile hills, woodlands and plains
It was situated in front of the strait

Close To The Edge
I. The Solid Time Of Change
Anderson/Howe
A seasoned witch could call you from the depths of your disgrace
And rearrange your liver to the solid mental grace
And achieve it all with music that came quickly from afar
Then taste the fruit of man recorded losing all against the hour
And assessing points to nowhere, leading ev'ry single one
A dewdrop can exalt us like the music of the sun
And take away the plain in which we move
And choose the course you're running
Down at the edge, round by the corner
Not right away, not right away
Close to the edge, down by a river
Not right away, not right away
Crossed the line around the changes of the summer
Reaching to call the color of the sky
Passed around a moment clothed in mornings faster than we see
Getting over all the time I had to worry
Leaving all the changes far from far behind
We relieve the tension only to find out the master's name
Down at the end, round by the corner
Close to the edge, just by a river
Seasons will pass you by
I get up, I get down
Now that it's all over and done
Now that you find, now that you're whole
II. Total Mass Retain
Anderson/Squire
My eyes convinced, eclipsed with the younger moon attained with love
It changed as almost strained amidst clear manna from above
I crucified my hate and held the word within my hand
There's you, the time, the logic, or the reasons we don't understand
Sad courage claimed the victims standing still for all to see
As armoured movers took approach to overlook the sea
There since the cord, the license, or the reasons we understood will be
Down at the edge, close by a river
Close to the edge, round by the corner
Close to the end, down by the corner
Down at the edge, round by the river
Sudden call shouldn't take away the startled memory
All in all, the journey takes you all the way
As apart from any reality that you've ever seen and known
Guessing problems only to deceive the mention
Passing paths that climb halfway into the void
As we cross from side to side, we hear the total mass retain
Down at the edge, round by the corner
Close to the end, down by a river
Seasons will pass you by
I get up, I get down
III. I Get Up, I Get Down
Anderson/Howe
In her white lace
You can clearly see the lady sadly looking
Saying that she'd take the blame
For the crucifixion of her own domain
I get up, I get down
I get up, I get down
Two million people barely satisfy
Two hundred women watch one woman cry, too late
The eyes of honesty can achieve
How many millions do we deceive each day?
[Thru the duty she would coil their said
Amusement of her story asking only interest
Could be laid upon the children of her domain]
I get up, I get down
I get up, I get down
In charge of who is there in charge of me
Do I look on blindly and say I see the way?
The truth is written all along the page
How old will I be before I come of age for you?
I get up, I get down
I get up, I get down
I get up, I get down
IV. Seasons Of Man
Anderson/Howe
The time between the notes relates the color to the scenes
A constant vogue of triumphs dislocate man, so it seems
And space between the focus shape ascend knowledge of love
As song and chance develop time, lost social temp'rance rules above
Ah, ah
Then according to the man who showed his outstretched arm to space
He turned around and pointed, revealing all the human race
I shook my head and smiled a whisper, knowing all about the place
On the hill we viewed the silence of the valley
Called to witness cycles only of the past
And we reach all this with movements in between the said remark
Close to the edge, down by the river
Down at the end, round by the corner
Seasons will pass you by
Now that it's all over and done
Called to the seed, right to the sun
Now that you find, now that you're whole
Seasons will pass you by
I get up, I get down
I get up, I get down
I get up, I get down
And You And I
I. Cord Of Life
Anderson/Bruford/Howe/Squire
A man conceived a moment's answers to the dream
Staying the flowers daily, sensing all the themes
As a foundation left to create the spiral aim
A movement regained and regarded both the same
All complete in the sight of seeds of life with you
Changed only for a sight of sound, the space agreed
Between the picture of time behind the face of need
Coming quickly to terms of all expression laid
Emotion revealed as the ocean maid
All complete in the sight of seeds of life with you
Oh
Coins and crosses
Turn round tailor, assaulting
Never know their fruitless worth;
All the mornings of the interest shown
Presenting one another to the cord
Cords are broken
All left dying, rediscovered
Of the door that turned round
Locked inside the mother earth
To close the cover, all the
Interest shown
They won't hide, hold, they won't tell you
To turn one another, to the sign at the time float your climb
Watching the world, watching all of the world
Watching us go by
And you and I climb over the sea to the valley
And you and I reached out for reasons to call
II. Eclipse
Anderson/Bruford/Squire
Coming quickly to terms of all expression laid
Emotion revealed as the ocean maid
As a movement regained and regarded both the same
All complete in the side of seeds of life with you
III. The Preacher the Teacher
Anderson/Bruford/Howe/Squire
Sad preacher nailed upon the coloured door of time;
Insane teacher be there reminded of the rhyme
There'll be no mutant enemy we shall certify;
Political ends, as sad remains, will die
Reach out as forward tastes begin to enter you
Ooh, ooh
I listened hard but could not see
Life tempo change out and inside me
The preacher trained in all to lose his name;
The teacher travels, asking to be shown the same
In the end, we'll agree, we'll accept, we'll immortalize
That the truth of the man maturing in his eyes
All complete in the sight of seeds of life with you
Coming quickly to terms of all expression laid
As a moment regained and regarded both the same
Emotion revealed as the ocean maid
A clearer future, morning, evening, nights with you
IV. Apocalypse
Anderson/Bruford/Howe/Squire
And you and I climb, crossing the shapes of the morning
And you and I reach over the sun for the river
And you and I climb, clearer, towards the movement
And you and I called over valleys of endless seas
Siberian Khatru
Anderson/Howe/Wakeman
Sing, bird of prey;
Beauty begins at the foot of you. Do you believe the manner?
Gold stainless nail
Torn through the distance of man
As they regard the summit
Even Siberia goes through the motions
Hold out and hold up;
Hold down the window
Outbound, river
Hold out the morning that comes into view
Bluetail, tailfly
River running right on over my head
How does she sing?
Who holds the ring? And ring and you will find me coming
Cold reigning king
Hold all the secrets from you
As they produce the movement
Even Siberia goes through the motions
Hold out and hold up;
Hold down the window
Outbound, river
Hold out the morning that comes into view
Bluetail, tailfly
River running right over the outboard, river
Bluetail, tailfly
Luther, in time
Dood'ndoodit, dah, d't-d't-dah
Hold down the window;
Hold out the morning that comes into view
Warm side, the tower;
Green leaves reveal the heart spoken Khatru
Gold stainless nail
Torn through the distance of man as they regard the summit
Cold reigning king
Shelter the women that sing
As they produce the movement
River running right on over my head
Outboard, river
Bluetail, tailfly
Luther, in time
Suntower, asking
Cover, lover
June cast, moon fast
As one changes
Heart gold, leaver
Soul mark, mover
Christian, changer
Called out, saviour
Moon gate, climber
Turn round, glider

The Empirical Self or Me. The Empirical Self of each of us is all that he is tempted to call by the name of me. But it is clear that between what a man calls me and what he simply calls mine the line is difficult to draw. We feel and act about certain things that are ours very much as we feel and act about ourselves. Our fame, our children, the work of our hands, may be as dear to us as our bodies are, and arouse the same feelings and the same acts of reprisal if attacked. And our bodies themselves, are they simply ours, or are they us? Certainly men have been ready to disown their very bodies and to regard them as mere vestures, or even as prisons of clay from which they should some day be glad to escape.
We see then that we are dealing with a fluctuating material. The same object being sometimes treated as a part of me, at other times as simply mine, and then again as if I had nothing to do with it at all. In its widest possible sense, however, a man's Self is the sum total of all that he CAN call his, not only his body and his psychic powers, but his clothes and his house, his wife and children, his ancestors and friends, his reputation and works, his lands and horses, and yacht and bank-account. All these things give him the same emotions. If they wax and prosper, he feels triumphant; if they dwindle and die away, he feels cast down, - not necessarily in the same degree for each thing, but in much the same way for all. Understanding the Self in this widest sense, we may begin by dividing the history of it into three parts, relating respectively to -
1. Its constituents;
2. The feelings and emotions they arouse, -- Self-feelings;
3. The actions to which they prompt, -- Self-seeking and Self-preservation.
1. The constituents of the Self may be divided into two classes, those which make up respectively -
(a) The material Self;
(b) The social Self;
(c) The spiritual Self; and
(d) The pure Ego.

(a) The body is the innermost part of the material Self in each of us; and certain parts of the body seem more intimately ours than the rest. The clothes come next. The old saying that the human person is composed of three parts - soul, body and clothes - is more than a joke. We so appropriate our clothes and identify ourselves with them that there are few of us who, if asked to choose between having a beautiful body clad in raiment perpetually shabby and unclean, and having an ugly and blemished form always spotlessly attired, would not hesitate a moment before making a decisive reply. Next, our immediate family is a part of ourselves. Our father and mother, our wife and babes, are bone of our bone and flesh of our flesh. When they die, a part of our very selves is gone. If they do anything wrong, it is our shame. If they are insulted, our anger flashes forth as readily as if we stood in their place. Our home comes next. Its scenes are part of our life; its aspects awaken the tenderest feelings of affection; and we do not easily forgive the stranger who, in visiting it, finds fault with its arrangements or treats it with contempt. All these different things are the objects of instinctive preferences coupled with the most important practical interests of life. We all have a blind impulse to watch over our body, to deck it with clothing of an ornamental sort, to cherish parents, wife and babes, and to find for ourselves a home of our own which we may live in and 'improve.'
An equally instinctive impulse drives us to collect property; and the collections thus made become, with different degrees of intimacy, parts of our empirical selves. The parts of our wealth most intimately ours are those which are saturated with our labor. There are few men who would not feel personally annihilated if a life-long construction of their hands or brains - say an entomological collection or an extensive work in manuscript - were suddenly swept away. The miser feels similarly towards his gold, and although it is true that a part of our depression at the loss of possessions is due to our feeling that we must now go without certain goods that we expected the possessions to bring in their train, yet in every case there remains, over and above this, a sense of the shrinkage of our personality, a partial conversion of ourselves to nothingness, which is a psychological phenomenon by itself. We are all at once assimilated to the tramps and poor devils whom we so despise, and at the same time removed farther than ever away from the happy sons of earth who lord it over land and sea and men in the full-blown lustihood that wealth and power can give, and before whom, stiffen ourselves as we will by appealing to anti-snobbish first principles, we cannot escape an emotion, open or sneaking, of respect and dread.
(b) A man's Social Self is the recognition which he gets from his mates. We are not only gregarious animals, liking to be in sight of our fellows, but we have an innate propensity to get ourselves noticed, and noticed favorably, by our kind. No more fiendish punishment could be devised, were such a thing physically possible, than that one should be turned loose in society and remain absolutely unnoticed by all the members thereof. If no one turned round when we entered, answered when we spoke, or minded what we did, but if every person we met 'cut us dead,' and acted as if we were non-existing things, a kind of rage and impotent despair would ere long well up in us, from which the cruellest bodily tortures would be a relief; for these would make us feel that, however bad might be our plight, we had not sunk to such a depth as to be unworthy of attention at all.
Properly speaking, a man has as many social selves as there are individuals who recognize him and carry an image of him in their mind. To wound any one of these his images is to wound him. But as the individuals who carry the images fall naturally into classes, we may practically say that he has as many different social selves as there are distinct groups of persons about whose opinion he cares. He generally shows a different side of himself to each of these different groups. Many a youth who is demure enough before his parents and teachers, swears and swaggers like a pirate among his 'tough' young friends. We do not show ourselves to our children as to our club-companions, to our customers as to the laborers we employ, to our own masters and employers as to our intimate friends. From this there results what practically is a division of the man into several selves; and this may be a discordant splitting, as where one is afraid to let one set of his acquaintances know him as he is elsewhere; or it may be a perfectly harmonious division of labor, as where one tender to his children is stern to the soldiers or prisoners under his command.
The most peculiar social self which one is apt to have is in the mind of the person one is in love with. The good or bad fortunes of this self cause the most intense elation and dejection - unreasonable enough as measured by every other standard than that of the organic feeling of the individual. To his own consciousness he is not, so long as this particular social self fails to get recognition, and when it is recognized his contentment passes all bounds.
A man's fame, good or bad, and his honor or dishonor, are names for one of his social selves. The particular social self of a man called his honor is usually the result of one of those splittings of which we have spoken. It is his image in the eyes of his own 'set,' which exalts or con- demns him as he conforms or not to certain requirements that may not be made of one in another walk of life. Thus a layman may abandon a city infected with cholera; but a priest or a doctor would think such an act incompatible with his honor. A soldier's honor requires him to fight or to die under circumstances where another man can apologize or run away with no stain upon his social self. A judge, a statesman, are in like manner debarred by the honor of their cloth from entering into pecuniary relations perfectly honorable to persons in private life. Nothing is commoner than to hear people discriminate between their different selves of this sort: ""As a man I pity you, but as an official I must show you no mercy; as a politician I regard him as an ally, but as a moralist I loathe him;"" etc., etc. What may be called 'club-opinion' is one of the very strongest forces in life. The thief must not steal from other thieves; the gambler must pay his gambling-debts, though he pay no other debts in the world. The code of honor of fashionable society has throughout history been full of permissions as well as of vetoes, the only reason for following either of which is that so we best serve one of our social selves. You must not lie in general, but you may lie as much as you please if asked about your relations with a lady; you must accept a challenge from an equal, but if challenged by an inferior you may laugh him to scorn: these are examples of what is meant.
(c) By the Spiritual Self, so far as it belongs to the Empirical Me, I mean a man's inner or subjective being, his psychic faculties or dispositions, taken concretely; not the bare principle of personal Unity, or 'pure' Ego, which remains still to be discussed. These psychic dispositions are the most enduring and intimate part of the self, that which we most verily seem to be. We take a purer self-satisfaction when we think of our ability to argue and discriminate, of our moral sensibility and conscience, of our indomitable will, than when we survey any of our other possessions. Only when these are altered is a man said to be alienatus a se.
Now this spiritual self may be considered in various ways. We may divide it into faculties, as just instanced, isolating them one from another, and identifying ourselves with either in turn. This is an abstract way of dealing with consciousness, in which, as it actually presents itself, a plurality of such faculties are always to be simultaneously found; or we may insist on a concrete view, and then the spiritual self in us will be either the entire stream of our personal consciousness, or the present 'segment' or 'section' of that stream, according as we take a broader or a narrower view - both the stream and the section being concrete existences in time, and each being a unity after its own peculiar kind. But whether we take it abstractly or concretely, our considering the spiritual self at all is a reflective process, is the result of our abandoning the outward-looking point of view, and of our having become able to think of subjectivity as such, to think ourselves as thinkers.
This attention to thought as such, and the identification of ourselves with it rather than with any of the objects which it reveals, is a momentous and in some respects a rather mysterious operation, of which we need here only say that as a matter of fact it exists; and that in everyone, at an early age, the distinction between thought as such, and what it is 'of' or 'about,' has become familiar to the mind. The deeper grounds for this discrimination may possibly be hard to find; but superficial grounds are plenty and near at hand. Almost anyone will tell us that thought is a different sort of existence from things, because many sorts of thought are of no things - e.g., pleasures, pains, and emotions; others are of non-existent things - errors and fictions; others again of existent things, but in a form that is symbolic and does not resemble them - abstract ideas and concepts; whilst in the thoughts that do resemble the things they are 'of' (percepts, sensations), we can feel, alongside of the thing known, the thought of it going on as an altogether separate act and operation in the mind.
Now this subjective life of ours, distinguished as such so clearly from the objects known by its means, may, as aforesaid, be taken by us in a concrete or in an abstract way. Of the concrete way I will say nothing just now, except that the actual 'section' of the stream will ere long, in our discussion of the nature of the principle of unity in consciousness, play a very important part. The abstract way claims our attention first. If the stream as a whole is identified with the Self far more than any outward thing, a certain portion of the stream abstracted from the rest is so identified in an altogether peculiar degree, and is felt by all men as a sort of innermost centre within the circle, of sanctuary within the citadel, constituted by the subjective life as a whole. Compared with this element of the stream, the other parts, even of the subjective life, seem transient external possessions, of which each in turn can be disowned, whilst that which disowns them remains. Now, what is this self of all the other selves?
Probably all men would describe it in much the same way up to a certain point. They would call it the active element in all consciousness; saying that whatever qualities a man's feelings may possess, or whatever content his thought may include, there is a spiritual something in him which seems to go out to meet these qualities and contents, whilst they seem to come in to be received by it. It is what welcomes or rejects. It presides over the perception of sensations, and by giving or withholding its assent it influences the movements they tend to arouse. It is the home of interest, - not the pleasant or the painful, not even pleasure or pain, as such, but that within us to which pleasure and pain, the pleasant and the painful, speak. It is the source of effort and attention, and the place from which appear to emanate the fiats of the will. A physiologist who should reflect upon it in his own person could hardly help, I should think, connecting it more or less vaguely with the process by which ideas or incoming sensations are 'reflected' or pass over into outward acts. Not necessarily that it should be this process or the mere feeling of this process, but that it should be in some close way related to this process; for it plays a part analogous to it in the psychic life, being a sort of junction at which sensory ideas terminate and from which motor ideas proceed, and forming a kind of link between the two. Being more incessantly there than any other single element of the mental life, the other elements end by seeming to accrete round it and to belong to it. It becomes opposed to them as the permanent is opposed to the changing and inconstant.
One may, I think, without fear of being upset by any future Galtonian circulars, believe that all men must single out from the rest of what they call themselves some central principle of which each would recognize the foregoing to be a fair general description, - accurate enough, at any rate, to denote what is meant, and keep it unconfused with other things. The moment, however, they came to closer quarters with it, trying to define more accurately its precise nature, we should find opinions beginning to diverge. Some would say that it is a simple active substance, the soul, of which they are thus conscious; others, that it is nothing but a fiction, the imaginary being denoted by the pronoun I; and between these extremes of opinion all sorts of intermediaries would be found.
Later we must ourselves discuss them all, and sufficient to that day will be the evil thereof. Now, let us try to settle for ourselves as definitely as we can, just how this central nucleus of the Self may feel, no matter whether it be a spiritual substance or only a delusive word.
For this central part of the Self is felt. It may be all that Transcendentalists say it is, and all that Empiricists say it is into the bargain, but it is at any rate no mere ens rationis, cognized only in an intellectual way, and no mere summation of memories or mere sound of a word in our ears. It is something with which we also have direct sensible acquaintance, and which is as fully present at any moment of consciousness in which it is present, as in a whole lifetime of such moments. When, just now, it was called an abstraction, that did not mean that, like some general notion, it could not be presented in a particular experience. It only meant that in the stream of consciousness it never was found all alone. But when it is found, it is felt; just as the body is felt, the feeling of which is also an abstraction, because never is the body felt all alone, but always together with other things. Now can we tell more precisely in what the feeling of this central active self consists, - not necessarily as yet what the active self is, as a being or principle, but what we feel when we become aware of its existence?
I think I can in my own case; and as what I say will be likely to meet with opposition if generalized (as indeed it may be in part inapplicable to other individuals), I had better continue in the first person, leaving my description to be accepted by those to whose introspection it may commend itself as true, and confessing my inability to meet the demands of others, if others there be.
First of all, I am aware of a constant play of furtherances and hindrances in my thinking, of checks and releases, tendencies which run with desire, and tendencies which run the other way. Among the matters I think of, some range themselves on the side of the thought's interests, whilst others play an unfriendly part thereto. The mutual inconsistencies and agreements, reinforcements and obstructions, which obtain amonst these objective matters reverberate backwards and produce what seem to be incessant reactions of my spontaneity upon them, welcoming or opposing, appropriating or disowning, striving with or against, saying yes or no. This palpitating inward life is, in me, that central nucleus which I just tried to describe in terms that all men might use. But when I forsake such general descriptions and grap- ple with particulars, coming to the closest possible quarters with the facts, it is difficult for me to detect in the activity any purely spiritual element at all. Whenever my introspective glance succeeds in turning round quickly enough to catch one of these manifestations of spontaneity in the act, all it can ever feel distinctly is some bodily process, for the most part taking place within the head. Omitting for a moment what is obscure in these introspective results, let me try to state those particulars which to my own consciousness seem indubitable and distinct.
In the first place, the acts of attending, assenting, negating, making an effort, are felt as movements of something in the head. In many cases it is possible to describe these movements quite exactly. In attending to either an idea or a sensation belonging to a particular sense-sphere, the movement is the adjustment of the sense-organ, felt as it occurs. I cannot think in visual terms, for example, without feeling a fluctuating play of pressures, convergences, divergences, and accommodations in my eyeballs. The direction in which the object is conceived to lie determines the character of these movements, the feeling of which becomes, for my consciousness, identified with the manner in which I make myself ready to receive the visible thing. My brain appears to me as if all shot across with lines of direction, of which I have become conscious as my attention has shifted from one sense-organ to another, in passing to successive outer things, or in following trains of varying sense-ideas.
When I try to remember or reflect, the movements in question, instead of being directed towards the periphery, seem to come from the periphery inwards and feel like a sort of withdrawal from the outer world. As far as I can detect, these feelings are due to an actual rolling outwards and upwards of the eyeballs, such as I believe occurs in me in sleep, and is the exact opposite of their action in fixating a physical thing. In reasoning, I find that I am apt to have a kind of vaguely localized diagram in my mind, with the various fractional objects of the thought disposed at particular points thereof; and the oscillations of my attention from one of them to another are most distinctly felt as alternations of direction in movements occurring inside the head.
In consenting and negating, and in making a mental effort, the movements seem more complex, and I find them harder to describe. The opening and closing of the glottis play a great part in these operations, and, less distinctly, the movements of the soft palate, etc., shutting off the posterior nares of the mouth. My glottis is like a sensitive valve, intercepting my breath instantaneously at every mental hesitation or felt aversion to the objects of my thought, and as quickly opening, to let the air pass through my throat and nose, the moment the repugnance is overcome. The feeling of the movement of this air is, in me, one strong ingredient of the feeling of assent. The movements of the muscles of the brow and eyelids also respond very sensitively to every fluctuation in the agreeableness or disagreeableness of what comes before my mind.
In effort of any sort, contractions of the jaw-muscles and of those of respiration are added to those of the brow and glottis, and thus the feeling passes out of the head properly so called. It passes out of the head whenever the welcoming or rejecting of the object is strongly felt. Then a set of feelings pour in from many bodily parts, all 'expressive' of my emotion, and the head-feelings proper are swallowed up in this larger mass.
In a sense, then, it may be truly said that, in one person at least, the 'Self of selves,' when carefully examined, is found to consist mainly of the collection of these peculiar motions in the head or between the head and throat. I do not for a moment say that this is all it consists of, for I fully realize how desperately hard is introspection in this field. But I feel quite sure that these cephalic motions are the portions of my innermost activity of which I am most distinctly aware. If the dim portions which I cannot yet define should prove to be like unto these distinct portions in me, and I like other men, it would follow that our entire feeling of spiritual activity, or what commonly passes by that name, is really a feeling of bodily activities whose exact nature is by most men overlooked.
Now, without pledging ourselves in any way to adopt this hypothesis, let us dally with it for a while to see to what consequences it might lead if it were true.
In the first place, the nuclear part of the Self, intermediary between ideas and overt acts, would be a collection of activities physiologically in no essential way different from the overt acts themselves. If we divide all possible physiological acts into adjustments and executions, the nuclear self would be the adjustments collectively considered; and the less intimate, more shifting self, so far as it was active, would be the executions. But both adjustments and executions would obey the reflex type. Both would be the result of sensorial and ideational processes discharging either into each other within the brain, or into muscles and other parts outside. The peculiarity of the adjustments would be that they are minimal reflexes, few in number, incessantly repeated, constant amid great fluctuations in the rest of the mind's content, and entirely unimportant and uninteresting except through their uses in furthering or inhibiting the presence of various things, and actions before consciousness. These characters would naturally keep us from introspectively paying much attention to them in detail, whilst they would at the same time make us aware of them as a coherent group of processes, strongly contrasted with all the other things consciousness contained, - even with the other constituents of the 'Self,' material, social, or spiritual, as the case might be. They are reactions, and they are primary reactions. Everything arouses them; for objects which have no other effects will for a moment contract the brow and make the glottis close. It is as if all that visited the mind had to stand an entrance-examination, and just show its face so as to be either approved or sent back. These primary reactions are like the opening or the closing of the door. In the midst of psychic change they are the permanent core of turnings-towards and trunings-from, of yieldings and arrests, which naturally seem central and interior in com-parison with the foreign matters, apropos to which they occur, and hold a sort of arbitrating, decisive position, quite unlike that held by any of the other constituents of the Me. It would not be surprising, then, if we were to feel them as the birthplace of conclusions and the starting point of acts, or if they came to appear as what we called a while back the 'sanctuary within the citadel' of our personal life.
If they really were the innermost sanctuary, the ultimate one of all the selves whose being we can ever directly experience, it would follow that all that is experienced is, strictly considered, objective; that this Objective falls asunder into two contrasted parts, one realized as 'Self,' the other as 'not-Self;' and that over and above these parts there is nothing save the fact that they are known, the fact of the stream of thought being there as the indispensable subjective condition of their being experienced at all. But this condition of the experience is not one of the things experienced at the moment; this knowing is not immediately known. It is only known in subsequent reflection. Instead, then, of the stream of thought being one of con-sciousness, ""thinking its own existence along with whatever else it thinks,"" (as Ferrier says) it might be better called a stream of Sciousness pure and simple, thinking objects of some of which it makes what it calls a 'Me,' and only aware of its 'pure' Self in an abstract, hypothetic or conceptual way. Each 'section' of the stream would then be a bit of sciousness or knowledge of this sort, including and contemplating its 'me' and its 'not-me' as objects which work out their drama together, but not yet including or contemplating its own subjective being. The sciousness in question would be the Thinker, and the existence of this thinker would be given to us rather as a logical postulate than as that direct inner perception of spiritual activity which we naturally believe ourselves to have. 'Matter,' as something behind physical phenomena, is a postulate of this sort. Between the postulated Matter and the postulated Thinker, the sheet of phenomena would then swing, some of them (the 'realities') pertaining more to the matter, others (the fictions, opinions, and errors) pertaining more to the Thinker. But who the Thinker would be, or how many distinct Thinkers we ought to suppose in the universe, would all be subjects for an ulterior metaphysical inquiry.
Speculations like this traverse common-sense; and not only do they traverse common sense (which in philosophy is no insuperable objection) but they contradict the fundamental assumption of every philosophic school. Spiritualists, transcendentalists, and empiricists alike admit in us a continual direct perception of the thinking activity in the concrete. However they may otherwise disagree, they vie with each other in the cordiality of their recognition of our thoughts as the one sort of existent which skepticism cannot touch. I will therefore treat the last few pages as a parenthetical digression, and from now to the end of the volume revert to the path of common-sense again. I mean by this that I will continue to assume (as I have assumed all along, especially in the last chapter) a direct awareness of the process of our thinking as such, simply insisting on the fact that it is an even more inward and subtle phenomenon than most of us suppose. At the conclusion of the volume, however, I may permit myself to revert again to the doubts here provisionally mooted, and will indulge in some metaphysical reflections suggested by them.
At present, then, the only conclusion I come to is the following: That (in some persons at least) the part of the innermost Self which is most vividly felt turns out to consist for the most part of a collection of cephalic movements of 'adjustments' which, for want of attention and reflection, usually fail to be perceived and classed as what they are; that over and above these there is an obscurer feeling of something more; but whether it be of fainter physiological processes, or of nothing objective at all, but rather of subjectivity as such, of thought become 'its own object,' must at present remain an open question, - like the question whether it be an indivisible active soul-substance, or the question whether it be a personification of the pronoun I, or any other of the guesses as to what its nature may be.
Farther than this we cannot as yet go clearly in our analysis of the Self's constituents. So let us proceed to the emotions of Self which they arouse.
2. Self-Feeling. These are primarily self-complacency and self-dissatisfaction. Of what is called 'self-love,' I will treat a little farther on. Language has synonyms enough for both primary feelings. Thus pride, conceit, vanity, self-esteem, arrogance, vainglory, on the one hand; and on the other modesty, humility, confusion, diffidence, shame, mortification, contrition, the sense of obloquy and personal despair. These two opposite classes of affection seem to be direct and elementary endowments of our nature. Associationists would have it that they are, on the other hand, secondary phenomena arising from a rapid computation of the sensible pleasures or pains to which our prosperous or debased personal predicament is likely to lead, the sum of the represented pleasures forming the self-satisfaction, and the sum of the represented pains forming the opposite feeling of shame. No doubt, when we are self-satisfied, we do fondly rehearse all possible rewards for our desert, and when in a fit of self-despair we forebode evil. But the mere expectation of reward is not the self-satisfaction, and the mere apprehension of the evil is not the self-despair, for there is a certain average tone of self-feeling which each one of us carries about with him, and which is independent of the objective reasons we may have for satisfaction or discontent. That is, a very meanly-conditioned man may abound in unfaltering conceit, and one whose success in life is secure and who is esteemed by all may remain diffident of his powers to the end.
One may say, however, that the normal provocative of self-feeling is one's actual success or failure, and the good or bad actual position one holds in the world. ""He put in his thumb and pulled out a plum, and said what a good boy am I."" A man with a broadly extended empirical Ego, with powers that have uniformly brought him success, with place and wealth and friends and fame, is not likely to be visited by the morbid diffidences and doubts about himself which he had when he was a boy. ""Is not this great Babylon, which I have planted?"" Whereas he who has made one blunder after another, and still lies in middle life among the failures at the foot of the hill, is liable to grow all sicklied o'er with self-distrust, and to shrink from trials with which his powers can really cope.
The emotions themselves of self-satisfaction and abasement are of a unique sort, each as worthy to be classed as a primitive emotional species as are, for example, rage or pain. Each has its own peculiar physiognomical expression. In self-satisfaction the extensor muscles are innervated, the eye is strong and glorious, the gait rolling and elastic, the nostril dilated, and a peculiar smile plays upon the lips. This whole complex of symptoms is seen in an exquisite way in lunatic asylums, which always contain some patients who are literally mad with conceit, and whose fatuous expression and absurdly strutting or swaggering gait is in tragic contrast with their lack of any valuable personal quality. It is in these same castles of despair that we find the strongest examples of the opposite physiognomy, in good people who think they have committed 'the unpardonable sin' and are lost forever, who crouch and cringe and slink from noticean, d  are unable to speak aloud or look us in the eye. Like fear and like anger, in similar morbid conditions, these opposite feelings of Self may be aroused with no adequate exciting cause. And in fact we ourselves know how the baromete",en,LABEL_0,0.49408960342407227,LABEL_1,0.5059103965759277

Less than three weeks before the election, we're going to take a break from campaign politics, sort of. Joining us will be Jon Stewart, host of ""The Daily Show"" on Comedy Central and co-author of a new best-seller entitled ""America (The Book).""
PAUL BEGALA, CO-HOST: We will spend the next half-hour with the most trusted man in fake news. And he has got pictures of all nine Supreme Court justices naked.
(LAUGHTER)
BEGALA: Worth staying tuned for.
First, though, we will begin, as we always do, with the best little political briefing in television, the CROSSFIRE ""Political Alert.""
When he wants to look moderate, Dick Cheney invokes his lesbian daughter, Mary, on the campaign trail. When Republican Senate candidate Alan Keyes viciously attacked their daughter, Dick and Lynne Cheney said nothing. When John Edwards praised their evident love for their daughter, Vice President Cheney said this.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DICK CHENEY, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Let me simply thank the senator for the kind words he said about my family and our daughter. I appreciate that very much.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BEGALA: But now, suddenly, after four debate losses and 18 days until the election, the Cheneys are shocked, shocked, that John Kerry mentioned their daughter in a debate.
There is an important lesson here. If you're gay and you want your rights protected by the Republicans, it helps to have a daddy who wants to distract the country from the millions he made from Halliburton, the billions he ran up in debt, and the war he lied us into.
(CROSSTALK)
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
CARLSON: I have to say, it takes -- it takes -- I admire your stones for defending the indefensible. Even you know that it's wrong, at the very least it's unseemly, to bring up this guy's daughter in two separate debates. And the fact they didn't get into an argument with lunatic Alan Keyes when he attacked their daughter proves nothing, other than they have good manners.
(LAUGHTER)
CARLSON: And the fact -- I'm serious.
BEGALA: No, they have very good manners, Dick Cheney, sure. Really?
CARLSON: What is he supposed to say when John Edwards says, hey, how's your lesbian daughter?
(CROSSTALK)
BEGALA: He said thank you very much.
(BELL RINGING)
BEGALA: Cheney has raised the issue in the context of campaign appearances.
CARLSON: He has never a single time volunteered anything about his daughter's sexuality.
(CROSSTALK)
CARLSON: And you know that that is true.
BEGALA: August 24, 2004.
(CROSSTALK)
CARLSON: In response to a question. He never a single time...
(CROSSTALK)
BEGALA: He brought her up on the campaign trail.
CARLSON: Yes, I'm sure he did.
(CROSSTALK)
BEGALA: That's just the one that I -- yes, he did. Check it out on Google.
CARLSON: Yes, my lesbian daughter.
(CROSSTALK)
BEGALA: August 24, 2001.
(CROSSTALK)
CARLSON: All right.
Well, there are legitimate, even powerful arguments, to be made against the Bush administration's foreign policy. But those arguments are complicated, hard to explain, and, in the end, not all that sensational.
It's a lot easier just to make things up. And so John Kerry has decided to do just that. In an interview with ""The Des Moines Register"" yesterday, Kerry warned that there is -- quote -- ""a great potential that Americans will be drafted into the armed forces if Bush is reelected president."" This is a total crock, as Kerry himself knows well. Virtually no one favors returning to the draft.
Bush is against it. Congress is against it. The Pentagon is completely against it. It is not happening now or anywhere in the near future. Again, John Kerry knows this very well, and yet he pretends otherwise in order to scare college students into voting for him. And they probably will vote for him, but it's still pretty dishonorable.
BEGALA: Well, first off, what is Bush's plan for helping out the Guard and Reserve?
CARLSON: That's a separate...
(CROSSTALK)
BEGALA: Kerry has a proposal to add 40,000 troops to the Army...
CARLSON: You're making a separate argument.
BEGALA: ... Bush stretched past the limit. What is Bush going to do? What's he going to do?
CARLSON: Well, you're making a separate argument. You're attacking Bush's policy towards the National Guard and Reserves, which I think is completely fair and deserves to be attacked, frankly. But there are no plans to reinstate draft because the Pentagon says that an all-volunteer Army is more effective. It's not going to happen, as you know.
BEGALA: Help me out, though. The guy who says we're not going to have a draft is the same guy who said there were weapons of mass destruction and there was a huge threat from Saddam Hussein.
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
CARLSON: You know what?
(CROSSTALK)
BEGALA: Bush has no credibility, Tucker.
CARLSON: It's not simply the decision of one man, OK?
(BELL RINGING)
CARLSON: It's a decision that, in the end, Congress will make. And there is no possibility it will make that decision, as you know.
(CROSSTALK)
CARLSON: Be see.
BEGALA: We'll see.
Terrorists exploded two bombs in the heart of heavily fortified Green Zone in Baghdad yesterday. Another bombing killed another American soldier in eastern Baghdad. Meanwhile, on the home front, the price of oil is hovering around $55 a barrel. The Bush administration has hit the debt limit of $7.4 trillion. They are using accounting tricks to keep the United States of America from going into default like a degenerate gambler with a bookie named Knuckles.
We are critically short of the flu vaccine. Health and Human Services says not to expect any vaccine from Canada, despite what President Bush said in the debate. And yet our president thinks he deserves reelection. In fact, he told reporters -- and I'm quoting here -- ""I feel great about where we are.""
Well, Newt Gingrich has a different take. ""If you don't have some anxiety,"" the former speaker said, ""you're not in touch with reality."" Well, Newt, I couldn't have said it better myself.
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
CARLSON: Well, of course, everyone has some anxiety, but that's not the point Bush is making, as you know.
I found it actually really interesting. There was a poll released today. I'm not exactly sure what it proves, but it does say something interesting; 69 percent of members of the armed services right now support Bush, as compared to less than 30 for Kerry, and that overall they were far more hopeful about the direction the country is moving than the average person. These are people, as you know, who are risking their lives in Iraq. It's not a defense of the Iraq policy, but it does say...
(BELL RINGING)
CARLSON: It says something interesting about perspectives.
(CROSSTALK)
BEGALA: It says that people in military are overwhelmingly Republican.
(CROSSTALK)
CARLSON: Which is an interesting question. Why? Why is that?
BEGALA: Because the military has always attracted a disproportionate number of Republicans.
CARLSON: I wonder why, though.
(CROSSTALK)
BEGALA: Well, first off, because they tend to poll the officer corps a lot more than the enlisted corps.
Look at Michael Moore's new book, ""Letters From the Front: Will They Ever Trust Us Again?"" Those are enlisted people who have a very different view than the elite officer corps do.
CARLSON: I'll get right on Michael Moore's new book.
(LAUGHTER)
CARLSON: Yes, definitely. I'll take it out of my local library.
BEGALA: You should.
CARLSON: Well, Winona LaDuke, remember that name? Even to students of presidential politics, it might not immediately ring a bell, so here is a refresher. LaDuke is the two-time Green Party candidate for vice president.
Four years ago, she ran with Ralph Nader on the party's stridently pro-hemp ticket. A longtime Indian rights activist, LaDuke rarely joined Nader on the campaign trail, owing in part to legal difficulties she had with her common law husband. He was head of the police at the time.
On one of the few occasions LaDuke did speak to the national press, she offered at least one policy proposal. If elected, LaDuke promised to remove pictures of white people from the White House and replace them with portraits of famous minorities. Down with George Washington. Up with Grover Washington.
This year, LaDuke is working on a wind power project and will not be running for office again. But in statement released this week, she declared that she's no longer supporting Ralph Nader. She's supporting John Kerry. Keep that in mind Election Day. John Kerry, if he's good enough for Winona LaDuke, he's good enough for you.
(LAUGHTER)
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
BEGALA: Come on. I mean, that's...
(CROSSTALK)
CARLSON: Someone has got to keep track of the celebrity endorsements here, OK?
(CROSSTALK)
BEGALA: That would be like me saying David Duke endorses George W. Bush.
(CROSSTALK)
CARLSON: You're missing it. You're missing it. You're missing it, Paul.
BEGALA: The Duke family is all over the...
(CROSSTALK)
CARLSON: Day after day, you make the argument, look, Barbra Streisand is voting for John Kerry. You should, too. And I'm just saying, there are other people who are voting for John Kerry. It's not just Barbra Streisand. It's also Winona LaDuke.
BEGALA: You know, David Lesar, the CEO of Halliburton, I believe is for George W. Bush.
CARLSON: I hope so.
BEGALA: So, you can go to Halliburton or you can go with David and Winona LaDuke, whoever they are.
CARLSON: Winona LaDuke.
BEGALA: I suspect they're not related, actually.
(BELL RINGING)
CARLSON: Well, he's been called the most trusted name in fake news.
Next, we're joined by Jon Stewart for his one-of-a-kind take on politics, the press and America.
We'll be right back.
(APPLAUSE)
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP, ""THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART"")
STEWART: Meanwhile, the president's challenger was also in New York, also facing some difficult questions.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: How to you stay in shape?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Do you eat something?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Do you have a routine? Do you...
(CROSSTALK)
STEWART: It's like Nerf CROSSFIRE.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
(APPLAUSE)
BEGALA: Welcome back to CROSSFIRE.
As both of our loyal viewers, of course, know, our show is about all left vs. white, black vs. white, paper vs. plastic, Red Sox against the Yankees. That's why every day, we have two guests with their own unique perspective on the news. But today, CROSSFIRE is very difficult. We have just one guest.
He's either the funniest smart guy on TV or the smartest funnyman. We'll find out which in a minute. But he's certainly an Emmy Award winner, the host of Comedy Central's ""Daily Show"" and the co-author of the new mega best-seller ""America (The Book): A Citizen's Guide to Democracy Inaction,"" at your bookstores everywhere.
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the CROSSFIRE Jon Stewart.
STEWART: Thank you.
CARLSON: Thank you for joining us.
STEWART: Thank you very much. That was very kind of you to say.
Can I say something very quickly? Why do we have to fight?
(LAUGHTER)
STEWART: The two of you? Can't we just -- say something nice about John Kerry right now.
(CROSSTALK)
CARLSON: I like John. I care about John Kerry.
STEWART: And something about President Bush.
BEGALA: He'll be unemployed soon?
(LAUGHTER)
BEGALA: I failed the test. I'm sorry.
CARLSON: See, I made the effort anyway.
BEGALA: No, actually, I knew Bush in Texas a little bit. And the truth is, he's actually a great guy. He's not a very good president. But he's actually a very good person. I don't think you should have to hate to oppose somebody, but it makes it easier.
(LAUGHTER)
STEWART: Why do you argue, the two of you?
(LAUGHTER)
STEWART: I hate to see it.
CARLSON: We enjoy it.
STEWART: Let me ask you a question.
CARLSON: Well, let me ask you a question first.
STEWART: All right.
(LAUGHTER)
CARLSON: Is John Kerry -- is John Kerry really the best? I mean, John Kerry has...
(CROSSTALK)
STEWART: Is he the best? I thought Lincoln was good.
(LAUGHTER)
CARLSON: Is he the best the Democrats can do?
STEWART: Is he the best the Democrats can do?
CARLSON: Yes, this year of the whole field.
STEWART: I had always thought, in a democracy -- and, again, I don't know -- I've only lived in this country -- that there's a process. They call them primaries.
CARLSON: Right.
STEWART: And they don't always go with the best, but they go with whoever won. So is he the best? According to the process.
CARLSON: Right. But of the nine guys running, who do you think was best. Do you think he was the best, the most impressive?
STEWART: The most impressive?
CARLSON: Yes.
STEWART: I thought Al Sharpton was very impressive.
(LAUGHTER)
STEWART: I enjoyed his way of speaking.
I think, oftentimes, the person that knows they can't win is allowed to speak the most freely, because, otherwise, shows with titles, such as CROSSFIRE.
BEGALA: CROSSFIRE.
STEWART: Or ""HARDBALL"" or ""I'm Going to Kick Your Ass"" or...
(LAUGHTER)
STEWART: Will jump on it.
In many ways, it's funny. And I made a special effort to come on the show today, because I have privately, amongst my friends and also in occasional newspapers and television shows, mentioned this show as being bad.
(LAUGHTER)
BEGALA: We have noticed.
STEWART: And I wanted to -- I felt that that wasn't fair and I should come here and tell you that I don't -- it's not so much that it's bad, as it's hurting America.
(LAUGHTER)
CARLSON: But in its defense...
(CROSSTALK)
STEWART: So I wanted to come here today and say...
(CROSSTALK)
STEWART: Here's just what I wanted to tell you guys.
CARLSON: Yes.
STEWART: Stop.
(LAUGHTER)
STEWART: Stop, stop, stop, stop hurting America.
BEGALA: OK. Now
(CROSSTALK)
STEWART: And come work for us, because we, as the people...
CARLSON: How do you pay?
STEWART: The people -- not well.
(LAUGHTER)
BEGALA: Better than CNN, I'm sure.
STEWART: But you can sleep at night.
(LAUGHTER)
STEWART: See, the thing is, we need your help. Right now, you're helping the politicians and the corporations. And we're left out there to mow our lawns.
BEGALA: By beating up on them? You just said we're too rough on them when they make mistakes.
STEWART: No, no, no, you're not too rough on them. You're part of their strategies. You are partisan, what do you call it, hacks.
(LAUGHTER)
CARLSON: Wait, Jon, let me tell you something valuable that I think we do that I'd like to see you...
(CROSSTALK)
STEWART: Something valuable?
CARLSON: Yes.
(CROSSTALK)
STEWART: I would like to hear it.
CARLSON: And I'll tell you.
When politicians come on...
STEWART: Yes.
CARLSON: It's nice to get them to try and answer the question. And in order to do that, we try and ask them pointed questions. I want to contrast our questions with some questions you asked John Kerry recently.
(CROSSTALK)
CARLSON: ... up on the screen.
STEWART: If you want to compare your show to a comedy show, you're more than welcome to.
(LAUGHTER)
CARLSON: No, no, no, here's the point.
(CROSSTALK)
STEWART: If that's your goal.
CARLSON: It's not.
STEWART: I wouldn't aim for us. I'd aim for ""Seinfeld."" That's a very good show.
CARLSON: Kerry won't come on this show. He will come on your show.
STEWART: Right.
CARLSON: Let me suggest why he wants to come on your show.
STEWART: Well, we have civilized discourse.
(LAUGHTER)
CARLSON: Well, here's an example of the civilized discourse.
Here are three of the questions you asked John Kerry.
STEWART: Yes.
CARLSON: You have a chance to interview the Democratic nominee. You asked him questions such as -- quote -- ""How are you holding up? Is it hard not to take the attacks personally?""
STEWART: Yes.
CARLSON: ""Have you ever flip-flopped?"" et cetera, et cetera.
STEWART: Yes.
CARLSON: Didn't you feel like -- you got the chance to interview the guy. Why not ask him a real question, instead of just suck up to him?
STEWART: Yes. ""How are you holding up?"" is a real suck-up. And I actually giving him a hot stone massage as we were doing it.
(LAUGHTER)
CARLSON: It sounded that way. It did.
STEWART: You know, it's interesting to hear you talk about my responsibility.
CARLSON: I felt the sparks between you.
STEWART: I didn't realize that -- and maybe this explains quite a bit.
CARLSON: No, the opportunity to...
(CROSSTALK)
STEWART: ... is that the news organizations look to Comedy Central for their cues on integrity.
(LAUGHTER)
(CROSSTALK)
STEWART: So what I would suggest is, when you talk about you're holding politicians' feet to fire, I think that's disingenuous. I think you're...
CARLSON: ""How are you holding up?"" I mean, come on.
(CROSSTALK)
STEWART: No, no, no. But my role isn't, I don't think...
CARLSON: But you can ask him a real question, don't you think, instead of saying...
(CROSSTALK)
STEWART: I don't think I have to. By the way, I also asked him, ""Were you in Cambodia?"" But I didn't really care.
(LAUGHTER)
STEWART: Because I don't care, because I think it's stupid.
CARLSON: I can tell.
(CROSSTALK)
STEWART: But my point is this. If your idea of confronting me is that I don't ask hard-hitting enough news questions, we're in bad shape, fellows. (LAUGHTER)
CARLSON: We're here to love you, not confront you.
(CROSSTALK)
CARLSON: We're here to be nice.
STEWART: No, no, no, but what I'm saying is this. I'm not. I'm here to confront you, because we need help from the media and they're hurting us. And it's -- the idea is...
(APPLAUSE)
(CROSSTALK)
BEGALA: Let me get this straight. If the indictment is -- if the indictment is -- and I have seen you say this -- that...
STEWART: Yes.
BEGALA: And that CROSSFIRE reduces everything, as I said in the intro, to left, right, black, white.
STEWART: Yes.
BEGALA: Well, it's because, see, we're a debate show.
STEWART: No, no, no, no, that would be great.
BEGALA: It's like saying The Weather Channel reduces everything to a storm front.
STEWART: I would love to see a debate show.
BEGALA: We're 30 minutes in a 24-hour day where we have each side on, as best we can get them, and have them fight it out.
STEWART: No, no, no, no, that would be great. To do a debate would be great. But that's like saying pro wrestling is a show about athletic competition.
(LAUGHTER)
CARLSON: Jon, Jon, Jon, I'm sorry. I think you're a good comedian. I think your lectures are boring.
STEWART: Yes.
CARLSON: Let me ask you a question on the news.
STEWART: Now, this is theater. It's obvious. How old are you?
(CROSSTALK)
CARLSON: Thirty-five. STEWART: And you wear a bow tie.
(LAUGHTER)
(APPLAUSE)
CARLSON: Yes, I do. I do.
STEWART: So this is...
CARLSON: I know. I know. I know. You're a...
(CROSSTALK)
STEWART: So this is theater.
CARLSON: Now, let me just...
(CROSSTALK)
CARLSON: Now, come on.
STEWART: Now, listen, I'm not suggesting that you're not a smart guy, because those are not easy to tie.
CARLSON: They're difficult.
(LAUGHTER)
STEWART: But the thing is that this -- you're doing theater, when you should be doing debate, which would be great.
BEGALA: We do, do...
(CROSSTALK)
STEWART: It's not honest. What you do is not honest. What you do is partisan hackery. And I will tell you why I know it.
CARLSON: You had John Kerry on your show and you sniff his throne and you're accusing us of partisan hackery?
STEWART: Absolutely.
CARLSON: You've got to be kidding me. He comes on and you...
(CROSSTALK)
STEWART: You're on CNN. The show that leads into me is puppets making crank phone calls.
(LAUGHTER)
STEWART: What is wrong with you?
(APPLAUSE) CARLSON: Well, I'm just saying, there's no reason for you -- when you have this marvelous opportunity not to be the guy's butt boy, to go ahead and be his butt boy. Come on. It's embarrassing.
STEWART: I was absolutely his butt boy. I was so far -- you would not believe what he ate two weeks ago.
(LAUGHTER)
(CROSSTALK)
STEWART: You know, the interesting thing I have is, you have a responsibility to the public discourse, and you fail miserably.
CARLSON: You need to get a job at a journalism school, I think.
STEWART: You need to go to one.
The thing that I want to say is, when you have people on for just knee-jerk, reactionary talk...
CARLSON: Wait. I thought you were going to be funny. Come on. Be funny.
STEWART: No. No. I'm not going to be your monkey.
(LAUGHTER)
BEGALA: Go ahead. Go ahead.
STEWART: I watch your show every day. And it kills me.
CARLSON: I can tell you love it.
STEWART: It's so -- oh, it's so painful to watch.
(LAUGHTER)
STEWART: You know, because we need what you do. This is such a great opportunity you have here to actually get politicians off of their marketing and strategy.
CARLSON: Is this really Jon Stewart? What is this, anyway?
STEWART: Yes, it's someone who watches your show and cannot take it anymore.
(LAUGHTER)
STEWART: I just can't.
CARLSON: What's it like to have dinner with you? It must be excruciating. Do you like lecture people like this or do you come over to their house and sit and lecture them; they're not doing the right thing, that they're missing their opportunities, evading their responsibilities? STEWART: If I think they are.
(LAUGHTER)
CARLSON: I wouldn't want to eat with you, man. That's horrible.
STEWART: I know. And you won't. But the thing I want to get to...
BEGALA: We did promise naked pictures of the Supreme Court justices.
CARLSON: Yes, we did. Let's get to those.
(CROSSTALK)
BEGALA: They're in this book, which is a very funny book.
STEWART: Why can't we just talk -- please, I beg of you guys, please.
CARLSON: I think you watch too much CROSSFIRE.
We're going to take a quick break.
STEWART: No, no, no, please.
CARLSON: No, no, hold on. We've got commercials.
(CROSSTALK)
STEWART: Please. Please stop.
CARLSON: Next, Jon Stewart in the ""Rapid Fire.""
STEWART: Please stop.
CARLSON: Hopefully, he'll be here, we hope, we think.
(APPLAUSE)
CARLSON: And then, did U.S. soldiers refuse an order in Iraq. Wolf Blitzer has the latest on this investigation right after the break.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
WOLF BLITZER, CNN ANCHOR: I'm Wolf Blitzer in Washington.
Coming up at the top of the hour, the Pentagon investigator a report that U.S. soldiers refused to go on a dangerous mission in Iraq. We'll have details. In medical news, the FDA prescribes a strongly worded label on antidepressant drugs. And why some experts think the flu vaccine shortage is a grim warning about U.S. vulnerability to bioterrorism.
All those stories, much more, only minutes away on ""WOLF BLITZER REPORTS.""
Now back to CROSSFIRE.
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
CARLSON: Welcome back to CROSSFIRE.
We're talking to Jon Stewart, who was just lecturing us on our moral inferiority.
Jon, you're bumming us out. Tell us, what do you think about the Bill O'Reilly vibrator story?
STEWART: I'm sorry. I don't.
CARLSON: Oh, OK.
STEWART: What do you think?
BEGALA: Let me change the subject.
STEWART: Where's your moral outrage on this?
CARLSON: I don't have any.
STEWART: I know.
BEGALA: Which candidate do you suppose would provide you better material?
STEWART: I'm sorry?
BEGALA: Which candidate do you suppose would provide you better material if he won?
STEWART: Mr. T. I think he'd be the funniest. I don't...
(LAUGHTER)
BEGALA: Don't you have a stake in it that way, as not just a citizen, but as a professional comic?
(CROSSTALK)
STEWART: Right, which I hold to be much more important than as a citizen.
BEGALA: Well, there you go.
(LAUGHTER)
BEGALA: But who would you provide you better material, do you suppose?
STEWART: I don't really know. That's kind of not how we look at it. We look at, the absurdity of the system provides us the most material. And that is best served by sort of the theater of it all, you know, which, by the way, thank you both, because it's been helpful.
(LAUGHTER)
CARLSON: But, if Kerry gets elected, is it going to -- you have said you're voting for him. You obviously support him. It's clear. Will it be harder for you to mock his administration if he becomes president?
STEWART: No. Why would it be harder?
CARLSON: Because you support...
(CROSSTALK)
STEWART: The only way it would be harder is if his administration is less absurd than this one. So, in that case, if it's less absurd, then, yes, I think it would be harder.
But, I mean, it would be hard to top this group, quite frankly.
(LAUGHTER)
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
STEWART: In terms of absurdity and their world matching up to the one that -- you know, it was interesting. President Bush was saying, John Kerry's rhetoric doesn't match his record.
But I've heard President Bush describe his record. His record doesn't match his record.
(LAUGHTER)
STEWART: So I don't worry about it in that respect.
But let me ask you guys, again, a question, because we talked a little bit about, you're actually doing honest debate and all that. But, after the debates, where do you guys head to right afterwards?
CARLSON: The men's room.
STEWART: Right after that?
BEGALA: Home.
STEWART: Spin alley.
BEGALA: Home.
STEWART: No, spin alley.
BEGALA: What are you talking about? You mean at these debates?
STEWART: Yes. You go to spin alley, the place called spin alley. Now, don't you think that, for people watching at home, that's kind of a drag, that you're literally walking to a place called deception lane?
(LAUGHTER)
STEWART: Like, it's spin alley. It's -- don't you see, that's the issue I'm trying to talk to you guys...
BEGALA: No, I actually believe -- I have a lot of friends who work for President Bush. I went to college with some of them.
CARLSON: Neither of us was ever in the spin room, actually.
(BELL RINGING)
BEGALA: No, I did -- I went to do the Larry King show.
They actually believe what they're saying. They want to persuade you. That's what they're trying to do by spinning. But I don't doubt for a minute these people who work for President Bush, who I disagree with on everything, they believe that stuff, Jon. This is not a lie or a deception at all. They believe in him, just like I believe in my guy.
(CROSSTALK)
STEWART: I think they believe President Bush would do a better job.
And I believe the Kerry guys believe President Kerry would do a better job. But what I believe is, they're not making honest arguments. So what they're doing is, in their mind, the ends justify the means.
(CROSSTALK)
BEGALA: I don't think so at all.
(CROSSTALK)
CARLSON: I do think you're more fun on your show. Just my opinion.
(CROSSTALK)
CARLSON: OK, up next, Jon Stewart goes one on one with his fans...
(CROSSTALK)
STEWART: You know what's interesting, though? You're as big a dick on your show as you are on any show.
(LAUGHTER)
CARLSON: Now, you're getting into it. I like that.
STEWART: Yes.
CARLSON: OK. We'll be right back.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
BEGALA: Welcome back to CROSSFIRE. We are joined by Comedy Central's Jon Stewart, host of ""The Daily Show"" and author of No. 1 bestseller, ""America (The Book): A Citizen's Guide to Democracy Inaction.""
CARLSON: And a ton of fun, I like that too.
BEGALA: Some questions from our audience. Yes sir, what's your name, what's your name?
QUESTION: Hi, my name's David. I'm from Boston.
STEWART: Hi, David.
QUESTION: My question is, what do you think the hump on G.W.'s back during the debate was?
STEWART: Say it again?
QUESTION: What do you think the hump on George's back during the debate was?
STEWART: The hump on his back?
BEGALA: Oh, you're familiar? This is (INAUDIBLE) conspiracy theory. Can I take this one?
STEWART: Yes, please.
BEGALA: It was nothing, his suit was puckering. A lot of people believe he had one of these in his ear. If he was being fed lines by Karl Rove, he would not have been so inarticulate, guys. It's a myth.
(LAUGHTER)
BEGALA: It's not true. There's this huge myth out on the left.
(CROSSTALK)
BEGALA: Yes, ma'am.
QUESTION: Renee (ph) from Texas. Why do you think it's hard or difficult or impossible for politicians to answer a straight, simple question?
STEWART: I don't think it's hard. I just think that nobody holds their feet to the fire to do it. So they don't have to. They get to come on shows that don't...
BEGALA: They're too easy on them.
CARLSON: Yes. Ask them how you hold...
STEWART: Not easy on them...
(CROSSTALK)
BEGALA: ... saying we were too hard on people and too (INAUDIBLE).
(CROSSTALK)
STEWART: I think you're - yes.
CARLSON: All right. Jon Stewart, come back soon.
BEGALA: Jon Stewart, good of you to join us. Thank you very much. The book is ""America: A Citizen's Guide to Democracy Inaction.""

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Elaboration and Popularization Speech at the Graveside of Karl Marx
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† FRIEDRICH ENGELS
Marx died on March 14, 1883. Three days later Engels delivered this graveside speech in English at Highgate Cemetery, London, where Marx was buried. Engels spoke in English. The speech appeared in a German paper in German translation, and has appeared in English only in re-translation from the German.
¬†¬†¬†¬† On the 14th of March, at a quarter to three in the afternoon, the  greatest living thinker ceased to think. He had been left alone for  scarcely two minutes, and when we came back we found him in his  armchair, peacefully gone to sleep-but for ever.
¬†¬†¬†¬† An immeasurable loss has been sustained both by the militant proletariat of Europe and America, and by historical science, in the death of this man. The gap that has been left by the departure of  this mighty spirit will soon enough make itself felt.
¬†¬†¬†¬† Just as Darwin discovered the law of development of organic nature, so Marx discovered the law of development of human history: the simple fact, hitherto concealed by an overgrowth of ideology, that mankind must first of all eat, drink, have shelter and clothing, before it can pursue politics, science, art, religion, etc. that therefore the production of the immediate material means of subsistence and consequently the degree of economic development attained by a given people or during a given epoch form the foundation upon which the state institutions, the legal conceptions, art, and even the ideas on religion, of the people concerned have been evolved, and in the light of which they must, therefore, be explained, instead of <>vice versa, as had hitherto been the case. But that is not all. Marx also discovered the special law of motion governing the present-day capitalist mode of production and the bourgeois society that this mode of production has created. The discovery of surplus value suddenly threw light on the problem, in trying to solve which all previous investigations, of both bourgeois economists and socialist critics, had been groping in the dark.
¬†¬†¬†¬† Two such discoveries would be enough for one lifetime. Happy the man to whom it is granted to make even one such discovery. But in every single field which Marx investigated-and he investigated very many fields, none of them superficially-in every field, even in that of mathematics, he made independent discoveries.
¬†¬†¬†¬† Such was the man of science. But this was not even half the man. Science was for Marx a historically dynamic, revolutionary force. However great the joy with which he welcomed a new discovery in some theoretical science whose practical application, perhaps it was as yet quite impossible to envisage, he experienced quite another kind of joy when the discovery involved immediate revolutionary changes in the industry, and in historical development in general. For example, he followed closely the development of the discoveries made in the field of electricity and recently those of Marcel Deprez.
¬†¬†¬†¬† For Marx was before all else a revolutionist. His real mission in life was to contribute, in one way or another, to the overthrow of  capitalist society and of the state institutions which it had brought  into being, to contribute to the liberation of the modern proletariat, which he was the first to make conscious of its own position and its  needs, conscious of the conditions of its emancipation. Fighting was his element. And he fought with a passion, a tenacity and a success, such as few could rival. His work on the first Rheinische Zeitung (1842), tbe Paris Vorwiirts1 ( 1 844), the Deutsche Briisse¬≠ler Zeitung (1847) , the Neue Rheinische Zeitung ( 1 848-49 ), the New York Tribune ( 1 852-6 1 ), and in addition to these a host of militant pamphlets, work in organizations in Paris, Brussels and London, and finally, crowning all, the formation of the great International  Working Men's Association-this was indeed an achievement of which its founder might well have been proud even if he had done nothing else.
¬†¬†¬†¬† And, consequently, Marx was the best hated and most calumniated man of his time. Governments, both absolutist and republican, deported him from their territories. Bourgeois, whether conservative or ultra democratic, vied with one another in heaping slanders upon him. All this he brushed aside as though it were cobweb, ignoring it, answering only when extreme necessity compelled him. And he died beloved, revered and mourned by millions of revolutionary fellow workers-from the mines of Siberia to California, in all parts of Europe and America-and I make bold to say that though he may have had many opponents he had hardly one personal enemy.
¬†¬†¬†¬† His name will endure through the ages, and so also will his work!

¬†¬†¬†¬† Engels' polemical work Herr Eugen Diihring's Revolution in Science, better known as Anti-Diihring, came out in 1878. At the request of his friend Paul Lafargue, Engels arranged three general chapters of  Anti- Dihring as a pamphlet dealing with the origins of Marxism and summarizing its view of history. Originally published in French in 1880, Socialism: Utopian and Scientific soon appeared in many other languages and became, along with the Communist Manifesto, the most influential popular presentation of the Marxist position in the late nineteenth century. The text given here is that of the authorized  English edition of 1892.

¬†¬†¬†¬† Modern socialism is, in its essence, the direct product of the recognition, on the one hand, of the class antagonism existing in the society of today between proprietors and non-proprietors, between capitalists and wage-workers; on the other hand, of the anarchy existing in production. But, in its theoretical form, modern socialism originally appears ostensibly as a more logical extension of the principles laid down by the great French philosophers of the eighteenth century. Like every new theory, modern socialism had, at first, to connect itself with the intellectual stock-in-trade ready to its hand, however deeply its roots lay in material economic facts.
¬†¬†¬†¬† The great men, who in France prepared m en's minds for the coming revolution, were themselves extreme revolutionists. They recognized no external authority of any kind whatever. Religion, natural science, society, political institutions-everything was subjected to the most unsparing criticism: everything must justify its existence before the judgement-seat of reason or give up existence. Reason became the sole measure of everything. It was the time when, as Hegel says, the world stood upon my this head1 first in the sense that the human head, and the principles arrived at by its thought, claimed to be the basis of all human action and associations; but by and by, also, in the wider sense that the reality which was in contradiction to these principles had, in fact, to be turned upside down. Every form of society and government then existing, every old traditional notion was flung into the lumber-room as irrational; the world had hitherto allowed itself to be led solely by prejudices; everything in the past deserved only pity and contempt. Now, for the first time, appeared the light of day, the kingdom of reason; henceforth superstition, injustice, privilege, oppression, were to be superseded by eternal truth, eternal Right, equality based on Nature and the inalienable rights of man.
¬†¬†¬†¬† We know today that this kingdom of reason was nothing more than the idealized kingdom of the bourgeoisie; that this eternal Right found its realization in bourgeois justice; that this equality reduced itself to bourgeois equality before the law; that bourgeois property was proclaimed as one of the essential rights of man; and that the government of reason, the Contrat Social of Rousseau, came into being, and only could come into being, as a democratic  bourgeois republic. The great thinkers of the eighteenth century could, no more than their predecessors, go beyond the limits imposed upon them by their epoch.
¬†¬†¬†¬† But, side by side with the antagonism of the feudal nobility and the burghers, who claimed to represent all the rest of society, was the general antagonism of exploiters and exploited, of rich idlers and poor workers. It was this very circumstance that made it possible for the representatives of the bourgeoisie to put themselves forward as representing not one special class, but the whole of suffering humanity. Still further. From its origin the bourgeoisie was saddled with its antithesis: capitalists cannot exist without wage-workers, and, in the same proportion as the medieval burgher of the guild developed into the modern bourgeois, the guild journeyman and the day-laborer, outside the guilds, developed into the proletarian. And although, upon the whole, the bourgeoisie, in their struggle with the nobility, could claim to represent at the same time the interests of the different working classes of that period, yet in every great bourgeois movement there were independent outbursts of that class which was the forerunner, more or less developed, of  the modern proletariat. For example, at the time of the German Reformation and the Peasants' War, the Anabaptists and Thomas Munzer; in the great English Revolution, the Levellers; in the great French Revolution, Babeuf.
¬†¬†¬†¬† There were theoretical enunciation corresponding with these revolutionary uprisings of a class not yet developed; in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, Utopian pictures of ideal social conditions;2 in the eighteenth, actual communistic theories (MoreUy and Mably). The demand for equality was no longer limited to political rights; it was extended also to the social conditions  of individuals. It was not simply class privileges that were to be  abolished, but class distinctions themselves. A communism, ascetic, denouncing all the pleasures of life, Spartan, was the first form of the new teaching. Then came the three great Utopians : Saint¬≠Simon, to whom the middle- class movement, side by side with the proletarian, still had a certain significance; Fourier; and Owen, who in the country where capitalist production was most developed, and under the influence of the antagonisms begotten of this, worked out his proposals for the removal of class distinction systematically and in direct relation to French materialism.
¬†¬†¬†¬† One thing is common to all three. Not one of them appears as a representative of the interests of that proletariat which historical development had, in the meantime, produced. Like the French philosophers, they do not claim to emancipate a particular class to begin with, but all humanity at once. Like them, they wish to bring in the kingdom of reason and eternal justice, but this kingdom, as they see it, is as far as heaven from earth, from that of the French philosophers.
¬†¬†¬†¬† For, to our three social reformers, the bourgeois world, based upon the principles of these philosophers, is quite as irrational and  unjust, and, therefore, finds its way to the dust-hole quite as readily as feudalism and all the earlier stages of society. If pure reason and justice have not, hitherto, ruled the world, this has been the case only because men have not rightly understood them. What was wanted was the individual man of genius, who has now arisen and who understands the truth. That he has now arisen, that the truth has now been clearly understood, is not an inevitable event, following of necessity in the chain of historical development, but a mere happy accident. He might just as well have been born 500 years earlier, and might then have spared humanity 500 years of error, strife, and suffering.
¬†¬†¬†¬† We saw how the French philosophers of the eighteenth century, the forerunners of the Revolution, appealed to reason as the sole judge of all that is. A rational government, rational society, were to be founded; everything that ran counter to eternal reason was to be remorselessly done away with. We saw also that this eternal reason was in reality nothing but the idealized understanding of the eighteenth century citizen, just then evolving into the bourgeois. The French Revolution had realized this rational society and government.
¬†¬†¬†¬† But the new order of things, rational enough as compared with earlier conditions, turned out to be by no means absolutely rational. The state based upon reason completely collapsed. Rousseau's Contrat Social had found its realization in the Reign of Terror, from which the bourgeoisie, who had lost confidence in their own political capacity, had taken refuge first in the corruption of the Directorate, and, finally, under the wing of the Napoleonic despotism. The promised eternal peace was turned into an endless war of conquest. The society based upon reason had fared no better. The antagonism between rich and poor, instead of dissolving into general prosperity, had become intensified by the removal of the guild and other privileges, which had to some extent bridged it over, and by the removal of the charitable institutions of the Church.The ""freedom of property"" from feudal fetters, now veritably accomplished, turned out to be, for the small capitalists and small proprietors, the freedom to sell their small property, crushed under the overmastering competition of the large capitalists and landlords, to these great lords, and thus, as far as the small capitalists and peasant proprietors were concerned, became ""freedom from property."" The development of industry upon a capitalistic basis made poverty and misery of the working masses conditions of existence of society. Cash payment became more and more, in Carlyle's phrase, the sole nexus between man and man. The number of crimes increased from year to year. Formerly, the feudal vices had openly stalked about in broad daylight; though not eradicated, they were now at any rate thrust into the background. In their stead, the bourgeois vices, hitherto practiced in secret, began to blossom all the more luxuriantly. Trade became to a greater and greater extent cheating. The ""fraternity"" of the revolutionary motto was realized in the chicanery and rivalries of the battle of competition. Oppression by force was replaced by corruption; the sword, as the first social lever, by gold. The right of the first night was transferred from the feudal lords to the bourgeois manufacturers. Prostitution increased to an extent never heard of. Marriage itself remained, as before, the legally recognized form, the official cloak of prostitution, and, moreover, was supplemented by rich crops of adultery.
¬†¬†¬†¬† In a word, compared with the splendid promises of the philosophers, the social and political institutions born of the ""triumph of reason"" were bitterly disappointing caricatures. All that was wanting was the men to formulate this disappointment, and they came with the turn of the century. In 1802 Saint-Simon's Geneva letters appeared; in 1808 appeared a Fourier's first work, although the groundwork of his theory dated from 1 799; on January 1, 1800, Robert Owen undertook the direction of New Lanark.
¬†¬†¬†¬† At this time, however, the capitalist mode of production, and with it the antagonism between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat, was still very incompletely developed. Modern industry, which had just arisen in England, was still unknown in France. But modern industry develops, on the one hand, the conflicts which make absolutely necessary a revolution in the mode of production, and the doing away with its capitalistic character-conflicts not only between the classes begotten of it, but also between the very productive forces and the forms of exchange created by it. And, on the other hand, it develops, in these very gigantic productive forces, the means of ending these conflicts. If, therefore, about the year 1800, the conflicts arising from the new social order were only just beginning to take shape, this holds still more fully as to the means of ending them. The ""have-nothing"" masses of Paris, during the Reign of Terror, were able for a moment to gain the mastery, and thus to lead the bourgeois revolution to victory in spite of the bourgeoisie themselves. But, in doing so, they only proved how impossible it was for their domination to last under the conditions then obtaining. The proletariat, which then for the first time evolved itself from these ""have-nothing"" masses as the nucleus of a new class, as yet, quite incapable of independent political action, appeared as an oppressed, suffering order, to whom, in its incapacity to help itself, help could, at best, be brought in from without or down from above.
¬†¬†¬†¬† This historical situation also dominated the founders of socialism. To the crude conditions of capitalistic production and the crude class conditions corresponded crude theories. The solution of the ' social problems, which as yet lay hidden in undeveloped economic conditions, the Utopians attempted to evolve out of the human brain. Society presented nothing but wrongs; to remove these was the task of reason. It was necessary, then, to discover a new and more perfect system of social order and to impose this upon society from without by propaganda, and wherever it was possible, by the example of model experiments. These new social systems were foredoomed as Utopian; the more completely they were worked out in detail, the more they could not avoid drifting off into pure fantasies.
¬†¬†¬†¬† These facts once established, we need not dwell a moment longer upon this side of the question, now wholly belonging to the past. We can leave it to the literary small fry to solemnly quibble over these fantasies, which today only make us smile, and to crow over the superiority of their own bald reasoning, as compared with such ""insanity."" For ourselves, we delight in the stupendously grand thoughts and germs of thought that everywhere break out through their fantastic covering, and to which these Philistines are blind.
¬†¬†¬†¬† Saint-Simon was a son of the great French Revolution, at the outbreak of which he was not yet thirty. The Revolution was the victory of the third estate, i.e., of the great masses of the nation,working in production and in trade, over the privileged idle classes, the nobles and the priests.
¬†¬†¬†¬† But the victory of the third estate soon revealed itself as exclusively the victory of a small part of this ""estate,"" as the conquest of political power by the socially privileged section of it, i.e., the propertied bourgeoisie.
¬†¬†¬†¬† And the bourgeoisie had certainly developed rapidly during the Revolution, partly by speculation in the lands of the nobility and of the Church, confiscated and afterwards put up for sale, and partly by frauds upon the nation by means of army contracts. It was the domination of these swindlers that, under the Directorate, brought France to the verge of ruin, and thus gave Napoleon the pretext for his coup d'etat.
¬†¬†¬†¬† Hence, to Saint-Simon the antagonism between the third estate and the privileged classes took the form of an antagonism between ""workers"" and ""idlers."" The idlers were not merely the old privileged classes, but also all who, without taking any part in production or distribution, lived on their incomes. And the workers were not only the wage-workers, but also the manufacturers, the merchants, the bankers. That the idlers had lost the capacity for intellectual leadership and political supremacy had been proved, and was by the Revolution finally settled. That the non-possessing classes had not this capacity seemed to Saint-Simon proved by the experiences of the Reign of Terror. Then, who was to lead and command? According to Saint-Simon, science and industry, both united by a new religious bond, destined to restore that unity of religious ideas which had been lost since the time of the Reformation-a necessarily mystic and rigidly hierarchic ""new Christianity."" But science, that was the scholars; and industry, that was, in the first place, the working bourgeois, manufacturers, merchants, bankers. These bourgeois were, certainly, intended by Saint-Simon to transform themselves into a kind of public officials, of social trustees; but they were still to hold, vis-a-vis of the workers, a commanding and economically privileged position. The bankers, especially were to be called upon to direct the whole of social production by the regulation of credit. This conception was in exact keeping with a time in which modern industry in France and, with it, the chasm between bourgeoisie and proletariat was only just coming into existence. But what Saint-Simon especially lays stress upon is this: what interests him first, and above all other things, is the lot of the class that is the most numerous and the most poor ( ""la classe la plus nombreuse et la plus pauvre"" ) .
¬†¬†¬†¬† Already in his Geneva letters, Saint-Simon lays down the proposition that ""all men ought to work."" In the same work he recognizes also that the Reign of Terror was the reign of the non-possessing masses. ""See,"" says he to them, ""what happened in France at the time when your comrades held sway there: they brought about a famine."" But to recognize the French Revolution as a class war, and not simply one between nobility and bourgeoisie, but between nobility, bourgeoisie, and the non-possessors, was, in the year 1 802, a most pregnant discovery. In 1816, he declares that politics is the science of production, and foretells the complete absorption of politics by economics. The knowledge that economic conditions are the basis of political institutions appears here only in embryo. Yet what is here already very plainly expressed is the idea of the future conversion of political rule over men into an administration of things and a direction of processes of production-that is to say, the ""abolition of the state,"" about which recently there has been so much noise.
¬†¬†¬†¬† Saint-Simon shows the same superiority over his contemporaries, when in 1814, immediately after the entry of the allies into Paris, and again in 1815, during the Hundred Days' War, he proclaims the alliance of France with England, and then of both these countries with Germany, as the only guarantee for the prosperous development and peace of Europe. To preach to the French in 1815 an alliance with the victors of  Waterloo required as much courage as historical foresight.
¬†¬†¬†¬† If in Saint-Simon we find a comprehensive breadth of view, by virtue of which almost all the ideas of later Socialists that are not strictly economic are found in him in embryo, we find in Fourier a criticism of the existing conditions of society, genuinely French and witty, but not upon that account any the less thorough. Fourier takes the bourgeoisie, their inspired prophets before the Revolution; and their interested eulogists after it, at their own word. He lays bare remorselessly the material and moral misery of the bourgeois world. He confronts it with the earlier philosophers' dazzling promises of a society in which reason alone should reign, of a civilization in which happiness should be universal, of an illimitable human perfectibility, and with the rose-colored phraseology of the bourgeois ideologists of his time. He points out how everywhere the most pitiful reality corresponds with the most high-sounding phrases, and he overwhelms this hopeless fiasco of phrases with his mordant sarcasm.
¬†¬†¬†¬† Fourier is not only a critic; his imperturbably serene nature makes him a satirist, and assuredly one of the greatest satirists of all time.  He depicts, with equal power and charm, the swindling speculations that blossomed out upon the downfall of the Revolution, and the shop-keeping spirit prevalent in, and characteristic of, French commerce at that time. Still more masterly is his criticism of the bourgeois form of the relations between the sexes, and the position of woman in bourgeois society. He was the first to declare that in any given society the degree of woman's emancipation is the natural measure of the general emancipation.
¬†¬†¬†¬† But Fourier is at his greatest in his conception of the history of society. He divides its whole course, thus far, into four stages of evolution-savagery, barbarism, the patriarchate, civilization. The last is identical with the so-called civil, or bourgeois, society of today¬≠i.e., with the social order that came in with the sixteenth century. He proves ""that the civilized stage raises every vice practiced by barbarism in a simple fashion into a form of existence, complex, ambiguous, equivocal, hypocritical""-that civilization moves in""a vicious circle,"" in contradictions which it constantly reproduces without being able to solve them; hence it constantly arrives at the very opposite to that which it wants to attain, or pretends to want to  attain, so that, e.g., ""under civilization poverty is born of superabundance itself.""
¬†¬†¬†¬† Fourier, as we see, uses the dialectic method in the same masterly way as his contemporary, Hegel Using these same dialectics, he argues against the talk about illimitable human perfectibility, that every   historical phase has its period of ascent and also its period of descent, and he applies this observation to the future of the whole human race. As Kant introduced into natural science the idea of the ultimate destruction of the earth, Fourier introduced into historical science that of the ultimate destruction of the human race.
¬†¬†¬†¬† Whilst in France the hurricane of the Revolution swept over the land, in England a quieter, but not on that account less tremendous, revolution was going on. Stearn and the new tool-making machinery were transforming manufacture into modern industry, and thus revolutionizing the whole foundation of bourgeois society. The sluggish march of development of the manufacturing period changed into a veritable storm and stress period of production. With constantly increasing swiftness the splitting-up of society into large capitalists and non-possessing proletarians went on. Between these, instead of the former stable middle class, an unstable mass of artisans and small shopkeepers, the most fluctuating portion of the population, now led a precarious existence.
¬†¬†¬†¬† The new mode of production was, as yet, only at the beginning of its period of ascent; as yet it was the normal, regular method of production-the only one possible under existing conditions. Nevertheless, even then it was producing crying social abuses-the herding together of a homeless population in the worst quarters of the large towns; the loosening of all traditional moral bonds, of patriarchal subordination, of family relations; overwork, especially of women and children, to a frightful extent; complete demoralization of the working class, suddenly flung into altogether new conditions, from the country into the town, from agriculture into modern industry, from stable conditions of existence into insecure ones that changed from day to day.
¬†¬†¬†¬† At this juncture there came forward as a reformer a manufacturer 29 years old-a man of almost sublime, childlike simplicity of character, and at the same time one of the few born leaders of men. Robert Owen had adopted the teaching of the materialistic philosophers: that man's character is the product, on the one hand, of heredity; on the other, of the environment of the individual during his lifetime, and especially during his period of development. In the industrial revolution most of his class saw only chaos and confusion, and the opportunity of fishing in these troubled waters and making large fortunes quickly. He saw in it the opportunity of putting into practice his favorite theory, and so of bringing order out of chaos. He had already tried it with success, as superintendent of more than five hundred men in a Manchester factory. From 1 800 to 1829, he directed the great cotton mill at New Lanark, in Scotland, as managing partner, along the same lines, but with greater freedom of action and with a success that made him a European reputation. A population, originally consisting of the most diverse and, for the most part, very demoralized elements, a population that gradually grew to 2,500, he turned into a model colony, in which drunkenness, police, magistrates, lawsuits, poor laws, charity, were unknown. And all this simply by placing the people in conditions worthy of human beings, and especially by carefully bringing up the rising generation. He was the founder of infant schools, and introduced them first at New Lanark. At the age of two the children came to school, where they enjoyed themselves so much that they could scarcely be got home again. Whilst his competitors worked their people thirteen or fourteen hours a day, in New Lanark the working-day was only ten and a half hours. ""'-Hen a crisis in cotton stopped work for four months, his workers received their full wages all the time. And with all this the business more than doubled in value, and to the last yielded large profits to its proprietors.
¬†¬†¬†¬† In spite of all this, Owen was not content. The existence which he secured for his workers was, in his eyes, still far from being worthy of human beings. ""The people were slaves at my mercy."" The relatively favorable conditions in which he had placed them were still far from allowing a rational development of the character and of the intellect in all directions, much less of the free exercise of all their faculties. ""And yet, the working part of this population of 2.,500 persons was daily producing as much real wealth for society as, less than half a century before, it would have required the‚Ä¢ working part of a population of 600,000 to create. I asked myself, what became of the difference between the wealth consumed by 2,500 persons and that which would have been consumed by 600,000?""3
¬†¬†¬†¬† The answer was clear. It had been used to pay the proprietors of the establishment 5 per cent on the capital they had laid out, in addition to over ¬£ 300,000 clear profit. And that which held for New Lanark held to a still greater extent for an the factory in England. ""If this new wealth had not been created by machinery, imperfectly as it has been applied, the wars of Europe, in opposition to Napoleon, and to support the aristocratic principles of society, could not have been maintained. And yet this new power was the creation of the working class.4 To them, therefore, the fruits of this new power belonged. The newly-created gigantic productive forces, hitherto used only to enrich individuals and to enslave the masses, offered to Owen the foundations for a reconstruction of society; they were destined, as the common property of all, to be worked for the common good of all.
¬†¬†¬†¬† Owen's communism was based upon this purely business foundation, the outcome, so to say, of commercial calculation. Throughout, it maintained this practical character. Thus, in 1 823, Owen proposed the relief of the distress in Ireland by Communist colonies, and drew up complete estimates of costs of founding them, yearly expenditure, and probable revenue. And in ‚Ä¢his definite plan ‚Ä¢ for the future, the technical working out of details is managed with such practical knowledge-ground plan, front and side and bird's-eye views all included-that the Owen method of social reform once accepted, there is from the practical point of view little to be said against the actual arrangement of details.
¬†¬†¬†¬† His advance in the direction of communism was the turning¬≠point in Owen's life. As long as he was simply a philanthropist, he was rewarded with nothing but wealth, applause, honor, and glory. He was the most popular man in Europe. Not only men of his own class, but statesmen and princes listened to him approvingly. But when he came out with his Communist theories that was quite another thing. Three great obstacles seemed to him especially to block the path to social reform: private property, religion, the present form of marriage. He knew what confronted him if h",en,LABEL_0,0.5012393593788147,LABEL_1,0.4987605810165405

Bitch, you see me in the streets, you better tuck that shit in like a cross-dresser
Bitch, my bars are the only reason that you actually got Chedda
It was his hottest bars ever
No wonder they call them ""Arcane""
What? One day he magically got better?
Yo, you are a weak-ass spitter, and an even weaker performer
Bitch, you were way fuckin' better when you had me in your corner
I've got bars in at least four battles that he's recorded
Bitch you dropped more money on those rounds than fuckin' Wheel Of Fortune!
Look at this fuckin' idiot
He's gettin' mad, he's tryin' to discredit me
At this point, your best bet is just tryin' to share the legacy
I feel like it's a game show sometimes, I gotta question the square next to me
You took eight bars for 200, Alex: your career was in jeopardy!
You see the left hand; a good look, shit'll catch you dead in the eye
This right hand? Wrote the best shit you ever said in your life
You have never been nice
Consider this a lesson in life
When you don't pay what you owe you gotta pay the Jefferson Price
I hope you get booed like, ""Dude you suck! You little FUBU fuck!""
I swear to God if you throw one punch I'll fuckin' chew you up
Everybody's just here to see if I swing on 'Cane like Scrooge McDuck!
Look at how much attention our fuckin' rivalry brings
Look, let's see how much fuckin' traction his little lies can achieve
Fuck a battle rap, this a casket match, this the shit y'all been dyin' to see
Cause we all know without The Undertaker, we would've never seen 'Cane have fire in the ring!
One
Nice round, I wonder who wrote those bars though
My knee's outta place right now, yeah
I said yo, this motherfucker should've been gettin' his bars up
Instead he was gettin' his beard up
Well now you fast food, I'll put that Big Mac to his beer gut
He at the barbershop like, ""I know this sounds weird but...
Give me the System Of A Down syndrome beard and let's go with the Macklemore haircut.""
The fuck is wrong with you son?
And why do you try to talk like Sylvester Stallone?
You lost to Stevie P out west, I thought the west was your home
Shit, you even signed a girl's breast, I bet you was just in the zone
But you don't get points for that shit when the bitch got a chest like Charron
Little flat chested bitch
Yo, that girl wasn't even a 3, I'd give her maybe like a 2
And that's the girl you went to the event with? That's your baby? That's your boo?
Nope
Shit you just love those ugly girls huh? I don't know how you date them like you do
But I guess your options are kinda limited when your face looks like a shoe
Meanwhile I'm the face that team 'Ganik has been tryin' to recruit
Cause I've been nice in the booth since pinstripes and a suit
He'll see defeat when the cleats catch him at chin height with the boot
And poke so many holes in his throat it'll turn his windpipe to a flute
See, he can't write bars like that
So I'm only doin' this battle cause I felt like I owed this to the fans
It would've happened sooner but this loser had a whole list of demands
He wanted to do the battle in Cali so he could have home spitter's advantage
With his whole clique in the stands and have it hosted by the Klan
That's when he phoned Bishop to rant, tryin' to go switch up the plans
He wanted a bowl of red M&M's and a gold tinted Sedan
With three Asian hookers in the back that used to pull tricks in Japan
And he insisted on growing that stupid beard to look as homeless as he can
And you told Marvin that his beard looked like the Wu-Tang logo
Shit, your beard look like you beggin' for loose change, hobo
Funny now this dude's name is too lame, your views ain't promo
I'm top of the food chain you look like you shop at the food bank bozo
Let me tell you this, your last battle got like 3,000 views, your career's in limbo
Ain't nobody checkin' for you, you've been stale from the intro
If his people stay hatin' I'm like a real estate agent
Post up on his front lawn and let four sail through his window
He don't write like that
Apparently they don't care
This fake Italian kept my name in his mouth for years and I know why you mention me
Cause you was never relevant til you tried to undermine my legacy
I should let smoke rise from his chimney like the Pope just died in Italy
You lied religiously but I Romans are known for revising history
That was good
Check it out, this motherfucker tried to claim he was a ghost writer but that was all lies
He said Dizaster stole his laptop but that was all lies
It's like battle rap was stuck in a paradox since you told that pair of lies
So it's only right tonight you get stomped out with a pair of Dock's 'til you paralyzed
So, yo, I'm here to watch this pathological liar get trapped and caught in the fire
I should take his fuckin' needle nose and snap it off with pliers
He's battle rap's Pinocchio: just look at the size of his nose
I wouldn't be surprised if it grows for all the lies that he's told
He said he couldn't cross the border for a rap on a gun case
Right, you ain't a shooter, I could wrap you in duct tape
It's like this meatball playin' street ball
He was duckin' travelin' upstate
Tried to pivot 'til we see how easy he can cross over
We know his pump fake
So yo, after this, stop lyin', stop snitchin', stop cryin', stop bitchin'
Stop pandering to these fans and vying for their attention
Your spot as Battle Rap's Biggest Loser will be forever reserved
And y'all fans can stop givin' him credit he never deserved
Cause after this I don't give a fuck if you starve in a ditch
Out of all people it's funny you're the one that started this shit
Then he gets called out for stealin' every bar that he spits
I guess what goes around comes around, huh? Karma's a bitch!
Yo!
Whatup Toronto y'all wit me?
Hello? Hello?
Yo, did you seriously just make fun of my fuckin' haircut? You little fuckin' shit stain
How you gonna make fun of anybody's haircut when you haven't taken your hat off since 5th grade?
Dude, look at you 'Cane
You look good dude
Got a longer beard, bought some Caustic schemes
You're right on time, looks like you dressed up as your favorite rapper for Halloween
Who wrote that bitch?
Freestyle
I said at the last event I was supposed to battle Bonnie, I was down for the scrap
At Battle Of The Sexes they offered 'Cane 40 B.A.R.R.S
He was like, ""Yeah...how much is that?""
Yo, you were 33 when you battled Corey Charron
That was in 2010
My dude, you are confirmed: at least 40 years old
You're 40? You're 40
No
You're 40 years old
Still tryin' to make it with music?
I guess, at this age, gettin' a 30 dropped on you is a major improvement!
So 30 is the new 40, this kid is too corny, it's an instant vic-tory
You always makin' up lies, every week it's a different story
Isn't it boring, bitch, you get animated, shit'll get gory
I'm killin' this random fuckin' Pickle Rick Morty!!!
See, all those bars you spit for Chedda, that was shit I was never meant to sell
And then, after Bargate came out, your little rap career got put up on the shelf
I mean it makes sense, you had those IKEA bars
Everything fell apart when you tried to put it together by yourself!
Oh, that's fire! What's wrong with y'all?
Oh my gawd, that's amazing!
So, go sit somewhere else, there ain't room at our table
Everything happens for a reason, 'Cane
You know what the reason is? God hates you!
I'm bringin' you back down to Earth
I'll turn Arcane into archangel
If any of these fans bought that bullshit you sold 'em...surprise, they Arcane'd you
Yo, you can try to pull that shit on these casual-ass new jack fans
And let these losers think you're Wolverine, when, truthfully, it's just a huge act, man
If you think all he bought was punchlines then shit will really fuck your head up
Cause check this out, Diz' was in on the shit the whole time bitch, the only thing you bought was a setup
Yo, you are fuckin' trash
You are fuckin' trash
Look at your fuckin' life
Dude, I mean I was patient with him, waited for him to admit that it was blatant plagiarism
But instead he switched and played the victim and blamed all of y'all
Like all of y'all put a gun to his head and made him pay for writtens
The fuck?
Actin' like I can't beat you
And thanks to this contract and Organik, I'mma keep this rap peaceful
But the next time you decide to bite the hand that feeds you
Make sure that it can't reach you
Bitch

I said yo, I could've predicted this clown was gonna start talkin' 'bout his hands early
Well here's a free lesson; real bosses don't get they hands dirty
I brought a room full of goons that's ready to stretch this man's jersey
So eat a dick you piece of shit I'm 'bout to fuckin' catch this damn 30
I got your fate in my hands like I'm flippin' Tarot cards
You got flat lines I don't I don't hear no heart
They said, ""Watch it he spread gossip."" I said, ""Let that weirdo prepare those parts
He needs gossip to compensate for havin' zero bars.""
I'm one of the great, I chop heads off and hung 'em on stakes
In that Grand Prix y'all seen me in one of my hungriest states
As far as Chedda, that was just somethin' I ate
You was starvin' watchin' me eat and you're lucky I tossed you a couple crumbs from my plate
Then you battled Jefferson: what a fuckin' disgrace
You sold your soul for a priceless when Soul punched you in the face
So that's when I looked up his name in a thesaurus, and consider it luck
""Caustic"" is another word for ""bitter"", which makes sense 'cause you bitter as fuck!
That's why you doin' all this fuckin' extra shit tryin' to act more tough
Well I brought a jackknife and a semi: that's a transport truck
I'll park that Mac on his grill like a transport truck
And if that don't kill him, the sixteen will like a transport truck
C'mon man, y'all should've read the warning signs
""Caustic"" means ""slightly corrosive""
But me? I write my best content under pressure, this material highly explosive
None of the bars he has are just poison and he just talks sick with his motives
So I came to mop the floor with Caustic make sure he gets properly disposed of
So I brought that rat poison cause he's the type to squeak and squeal
And I brought my peoples to keep that steel if the beef gets real
So please just chill or this geek gets killed
This battle is about who's the better writer and this biter can't compete with skill
So if you wanna spar lyrically, you're no match for my artillery
Your bars filler-y, I'm a killer with dark imagery
Get scared physically
It's a violent story, your mining quarry better have the iron or be ready to start drillin' B
I'm back ho
Your lines aren't nothin' to get bowled over
If mine's bolder you get bowled over like a bull dozer
Get it? Iron, ore, mines, boulder, back hoe, bulldozer
Strip mine down into layers and y'all can see the gold closer
I'm cookin'
For that chicken, I'mma spit like a slow roaster
No holster, the snub nose in the air, that's a cold shoulder
I let one ring it rattle his cage like a goal poster
His wig get split and get pushed sideways like his combover
And normally, I'm not the type to beef with critics
I'm the type to burn your fuckin' house down to the ground with your family sleepin' in it
The last thing you'll see is me light the match to the kerosene and flick it
To be specific, if I take a trip out west it's not for scenic visit
I'm focused player, you've been nothin' but smoke and mirrors your whole career, I'm so sincere
You don't got a leg to stand on, that's a broken chair
We don't compare
You was never even top 10, you on the lowest tier
And I bet your buddies wrote more bars for this battle than you've wrote in years
And when it comes to all your Fresh Coast pals, I've been known to roast your peers
I took the chain from Dizaster and The Saurus when they were the most revered
So if the whole Fresh Coast writes for you then it's only fair
For that chain I'm on a lookout to keep in the 6ix, I just made sure his whole coast is clear
Make some fuckin' noise y'all!

So he said he's gonna kill my whole family
That's this dude keepin' it real wit me
Dude, with as many fuckin' verses as you've taken it makes sense you're from Steel City
Aye, do you guys remember when Drake was like actually at all these events?
And you can see him in the crowd he's just fuckin' happy as it gets
There was no drama back then we were just rappin' with our friends
Then you can see his face change as 'Cane gets exposed for being a massive piece of shit
He fuckin' grabbed his keys and dipped and we fuckin' haven't seen him since
So let's all congratulate him; Alex Drake, it's hip hop's known bitch
But don't feel bad kiddo at least you're not the only Drake in Canada that doesn't write his own shit
If he wants to dig up dirt me, he's just jealous cause I'm legendary
If I wanted to dig up dirt on him I'd walk to the cemetery where his mom and sister are buried
Oh my god, when it comes to this disrespect shit I swear to God I'm a visionary
So fuck your mother, bitch!
Your mother puts the fuckin' ""bitch"" in ""obituary""
Yo...this shit just got incredibly real
Luckily for me, I don't fuckin' care how you feel
But we've been in this situation before, haven't we, Alex? So let's make a deal!
I said you can try to sucker-punch, oh my God I'll fuck you up
If they dug your little sister up she wouldn't be the only thing that stiffened up
Oh, so what your mom died, Arcane? I don't give a fuck!
You want me to quit spittin' the rest of this round? That's an extra 500 bucks!
I mean I don't know what else to say to you
They fuckin' died to get away from you!
I wrote all your shit back in the day cause on your own you wasn't capable
I mean let's face facts, half your fuckin' family died cause no one could relate to you
I guess in the last five years not that much has changed for you
I mean look at the fuckin' clothes that you've got on
I mean you're so fuckin' underground Arcane, do you feel any closer to your mom?
Yo, this fuckin' idiot used to hit my inbox like, ""Yo Caustic look at all this shit I wrote for this bum.""
And I was like, ""No, no, no Alex...this is how it's supposed to be done.""
Yo, this cat's been salty since before I got my title shot
His writing was shaky like Michael Fox, so he sent me paper like Michael Scott
It all makes sense why he needed so much assistance with his writer's block
I guess when half your family's in a coffin, it's a little hard to think outside the box
So this is it for you my guy, this round right here is do or die
It's either you or I and I'm a sick piece of shit
Dude I'll commit suicide just to go to your fuckin' family in Hell and tell 'em you said ""hi""
I hope you find a condom in your next fuckin' bologna sandwich
I hope you slip into a coma after you get diagnosed with melanoma and colon cancer
I hope for the rest of your shitty-ass life, you open shows for local rappers
I hope you can't take it one day, and you call a suicide hotline...and no one answers
So I did this round for all of y'all who thought homie was more than average
I mean, it's five years after Bargate, and he's still trying to control the damage
So, no one here needs to feel bad for Little Orphan Alex
'Cause I just lit this guy up like Aurora Borealis!

Are you one of mine
Who can sleep with one eye open wide?
Agonizing psychotic
Solitary hours to decide
Reaching for the light
At the slightest noise from the floor
Now your hands perspire
Heart goes leaping at a knock from the door

In the dead of night
In the dead of night

Rich and powerful ascend
Complicated bends to be free
To indulge in what they will
Any jaded thrill or fantasy
Shuttered windows that belie
All the stifled cries from within
And prying eyes are blind
To proceedings of the kind that begin

Oh boy, the running man is out of death
Feel cold and old, it's getting hard to catch my breath
It's back to ash, ‚ÄúNow you've had your flash, boy‚Äù
The rocks, in time, compress
Your blood to oil, your flesh to coal
Enrich the soil, not everybody's goal

Anyway, they say she comes on a pale horse
But I'm sure I hear a train
Oh boy, I don't even feel no pain
I guess I must be driving myself insane
Damn it all! Does Earth plug a hole in Heaven
Or Heaven plug a hole in Earth?
How wonderful to be so profound
When everything you are is dying underground

I feel the pull on the rope, let me off at the rainbow
I could have been exploding in space
Different orbits for my bones
Not me, just quietly buried in stones
Keep the deadline open with my maker
See me stretch for God's elastic acre

T√∫ me viste al principio, fue una broma
Luego la verdad se asoma
Intercambiamos sonrisas
Pas√≥ alg√∫n tiempo, poco menos de una hora
Y por debajo la mesa, tu tac√≥n toco mi bota

Fue m√°s sencillo que hacer la tabla del uno
Y a la hora del desayuno, ya sab√≠a que te amaba
A las semanas de iniciar con la aventura, se nos hizo miel la luna
Y un concierto pa' Tijuana
Era prohibido, era imposible
Pero hicimos lo que se nos dio la gana

Despu√©s de eso, nos ve√≠amos casi a diario
Nuestro amigo el calendario
Nos dio 400 citas

De tanto amarnos, nos volvimos dos extra√±os
No se qui√©n tom√≥ hoy tu mano
Ni t√∫ d√≥nde estoy ahorita

Dios se mueve en silencio y yo me muevo con √©l
En el lobby un combo enfunda'o en Nike Tech
Y en el club gatas que no son ni la mitad que mi ex
Oh, oh
Odio que conduzcas y llames para ver cu√°les son mis planes
Cuando veas que el Sol baje, coge y sin preguntarme
Ven a casa, a casa

Que fuera en la ciudad, la lealtad se compra y no hay amor
Loco, hablan de m√°s, soy muy paciente
Consciente y siempre estoy en silencio
En silencio

Ya sabes c√≥mo me muevo, pap√°
Le freno al mall y es un mood
Mantengo al 100 la vuelta
